In the brief clip posted to YouTube on Monday, the president-elect said that â€œour transition team is working very smoothly, efficiently, and effectivelyâ€, contradicting a wealth of media reports telling of chaos in Trump Tower as Trump struggles to build a team.





He said that he was going to issue a note of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, calling it â€œa potential disaster for our countryâ€. Instead he said he would â€œnegotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry backâ€.





Hours before Trumpâ€™s announcement, Japanâ€™s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, warned that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would be â€œmeaninglessâ€ without US participation.





Speaking to reporters in Buenos Aires on Monday, Abe conceded that other TPP countries had not discussed how to rescue the agreement if Trump carried out his promise to withdraw.

Abe, a vocal supporter of the 12-nation agreement, appears to have failed in his recent attempts to coax Trump out of his â€œAmerica firstâ€ protectionism.





The TPP, which excludes China, is thought to have been high on Abeâ€™s agenda when he became the first foreign leader to meet the president-elect in New York last week.





While details of their 90-minute meeting have not been released, Abe would have used the time to try to persuade Trump to go back on his campaign threat to pull the US out of TPP on day one of his presidency.





â€œThe TPP would be meaningless without the United States,â€ Abe said, after Japan and other TPP countries had discussed the agreement on the sidelines of the Apec summit in Lima at the weekend. 





He added that the pact could not be renegotiated. â€œThis would disturb the fundamental balance of benefits,â€ he said.





Trumpâ€™s determination to rip up the agreement will have horrified Abe, particularly after the property billionaire appeared to have softened his stance on other campaign threats, such as downgrading Washingtonâ€™s security commitment to allies Japan and South Korea.





Abe invested considerable political capital in pushing for TPP, which was signed in 2015 but has yet to be ratified, including overcoming strong opposition from Japanâ€™s influential farming lobby.





Abe, though, suggested he was already bracing himself for US withdrawal from the TPP, whose 12 participating countries cover 40% of the global economy. Last week he told a parliamentary committee that Trumpâ€™s threat, if carried out, could bolster moves towards a new regional trade pact that includes China.





â€œThereâ€™s no doubt that there would be a pivot to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) if the TPP doesnâ€™t go forward,â€ Abe told an upper house committee, according to Kyodo news agency.





â€œThe RCEP doesnâ€™t include the United States, leaving China the economy with the largest gross domestic product,â€ he added.





The RCEP comprises Japan, China and 12 other Asian countries, plus Australia and New Zealand, and has been under negotiation since 2013.





While China declined to join the TPP, feeling it was designed to isolate it politically and economically, the wider implications of the US going back on a trade deal that took seven years to negotiate is likely to harm China in the long term.





â€œThe US leaving TPP is a problem of America rejecting globalisation,â€ said Da Wei, an expert on the US at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. â€œChina is a beneficiary of globalisation and China is not willing to see the tide of globalisation ebb.â€





While some Chinese may be happy at what they see as a political failure for the US, ultimately â€œChina disapproves of this, China is anxious about the retreat of globalizationâ€, Da said.





Trumpâ€™s wider trade rhetoric could damage US-China relations, with his promotion of â€œeconomic nationalismâ€ at the centre of his frequent attacks on the worldâ€™s second largest economy, Da added.





Last week an editorial in the Communist party-controlled Global Times warned: â€œMaking things difficult for China politically will do him no good,â€ referring to Trump.





Meanwhile, the Australian government seemed reluctant to give up on the TPP deal entirely. Australiaâ€™s prime minister, who has just returned from a 25,000km round-trip to Peru to reinforce support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stressed the importance of the agreement as a â€œstrategic commitmentâ€.





Malcolm Turnbull said it was up to Trump and his new Congress to make decisions about what they believed was in their nationâ€™s interest.





â€œIt is very clear that from Australiaâ€™s point of view, getting greater access for Australian exports ... to those big markets is manifestly in our interest,â€ he said.





Steve Ciobo, the trade minister, said the TPP was â€œa good dealâ€ and Australia wanted to move forward with it. Speaking to the media in Canberra, he said there was still time for the US administration to reconsider its position before the TPP needs to be ratified. 





â€œWe need to let the incoming Trump administration have some time, letâ€™s have some patience,â€ he said.

"Times Insider shares insights into how we work at The New York Times. In this article, Sarah Maslin Nir, a Metro reporter, recounts a few â€œoopsâ€ moments she experienced during her recent dip into a church-state story about gender-segregated swimming at a public recreation center.As a reporter, it is important to immerse yourself in every story you do. On a Wednesday in June, I took that literally, plunging physically into a pool in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that has caused controversy because of its gender-segregation policy. For the past 20 years the Metropolitan Recreation Center pool has blocked off certain hours for female-only swimming in consideration of the local Hasidic Jewish population, which abides by strict rules pertaining to modesty. Because itâ€™s a city-owned indoor pool, critics say the policy is an inappropriate blending of church and state.That story had been widely covered. What was missing from the conversation was a sense of why this pool was meaningful to the community who used it, both religious and otherwise, and what itâ€™s like to be there.I made a few mistakes in my dip into this world.I didnâ€™t realize at first that to get access to the pool I had to sign up for a $75 membership like any other swimmer. (Plus side: Now I can swim at pools citywide â€” thanks, New York Times!)I came without a swimming cap. (The lobby attendant kindly lent me one.)But my biggest mistake was my bikini.I had naÃ¯vely thought that in the company of their own gender, the Hasidic women, who in public cover their elbows and knees and hair, would dress less conservatively. In my two-piece swimsuit covered in tiny sailboats I stuck out wildly from every other woman there during the single-sex session.From my article: Their swimming outfits would have been considered prudish even by the standards of 1922, when the pool was built. They swam in dresses, some with long sleeves. One paddled in thick black tights. Inside the locker room, wigs sat upside down on window ledges and benches while their owners swam with heads under ruffled swimming caps or knotted silk scarves.Oops.Nonetheless, aside from a few â€œyouâ€™re new here, arenâ€™t you?â€ quips from other swimmers, I swam in peace, backstroking and freestyling for nearly an hour just to get a sense of the place, and the community. All around me the Hasidic women bobbed, chatted and did water aerobics with pool noodles, and I didnâ€™t ask them a thing. I spent my laps planning how to approach a typically reporter-shy and insular population. I neednâ€™t have. Miriam Kahn, 76, in a pink bathing dress and ruffled hat, approached me first. We talked about how nice, and what good exercise, swimming was. Unasked, she told me how incredibly popular the single-sex swimming was. Now on topic, I quickly revealed to her that I was a reporter, as is my ethical duty, and we paddled and talked more about the subject. More and more interviewees swam by, readily joining the conversation.Another mistake: Although a friend who is a Marine had given me his combat notebook, which can be doused in rain and written on with a special pen, I hadnâ€™t thought to bring it. And because I didnâ€™t realize that my lap-swimming would turn into an aquatic philosophical debate on the separation of church and state versus religious tolerance â€” right there in the pool! â€” I had left my regular notebook in the locker room.Reporters are nothing if not resourceful. I clambered out of the pool and, chanting the spelling of one womanâ€™s name so I would remember it, begged a scrap of used napkin and a pen from the lifeguard so I could take notes.Immersing myself in a subject â€” whether itâ€™s riding on the back of a dirt bike to get a feel for what the reviled bike crews of New York City love about their sport, or reporting while getting manicures and even a leg wax for my investigation on labor exploitation and dangerous health conditions in New York City nail salons â€” is a vital part of my job. It shows interviewees Iâ€™m attempting to see from their perspective by putting a toe in the proverbial water of their lives.In the pool, the women who are desperate to preserve their separate swimming time said, â€œSee how nice this is?â€ Floating beside them in the green light of the antique pool house, I did.But I also saw the other sideâ€™s perspective â€” thatâ€™s my job. I may be a swimmer, but Iâ€™m a reporter first.",1
"How The Government is Profiling YouMIT In an effort to reverse these ongoing unconstitutional activities, William Binney revealed the National Security Agencys massive domestic spying program, Stellar Wind, which intercepts domestic communications without protections for US citizens. Binney disclosed that NSA sought and received access to telecommunications companies domestic and international billing records. He told the public that, since 9/11, the agency has intercepted between 15 and 20 trillion communications. Binney also revealed that the NSA concealed Stellar Wind under the patriotic-sounding Terrorist Surveillance Program, in order to give cover to the warrantless surveillance programs violations of Americans constitutional rights.

"FBIs History of Handing Terror Suspects Live ExplosivesTony Cartalucci During the alleged plot, undercover FBI agents posed as accomplices who supplied Ferdaus with one remote-controlled plane, C4 explosives, and small arms that he allegedly envisioned using in a simultaneous ground assault in Washington. However, the public was never in danger from the explosive devices, which were controlled by undercover FBI employees, the FBI said. Ferdaus was arrested in Framingham, near Boston, immediately after putting the newly delivered weapons into a storage container, the FBI said. Authorities described Ferdaus as a physics graduate from Northeastern University who followed al-Qaeda and was committed to violent jihad since early last year. In November 2010, a similar plot was engineered, then disrupted, also by the FBI this time in Portland, Oregon. The so-called Christmas Tree Bomber attempted to remote detonate a van he believed was filled with explosives, provided by the FBI, before being arrested during a Christmas tree lighting ceremony at Pioneer Courthouse Square. The FBIs official statement regarding the incident revealed that FBI agents had handled, even detonated live explosives with the entrapped suspect at Lincoln County Park in the lead up to the final failed bombing. According to the affidavit, on November 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Ore., where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack. Afterwards, on the drive back to Corvallis, undercover FBI operatives questioned Mohamud as to whether he was capable of looking at the bodies of those who would be killed in the upcoming attack in Portland. According to the affidavit, Mohamud responded, I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured. Upon returning to Corvallis that same day, the affidavit alleges that Mohamud recorded a video of himself with the undercover FBI operatives in which he read a written statement that offered a rationale for his bomb attack. On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland in order to finalize the details of the attack. Earlier this evening, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate what he believed to be explosives in a van that was parked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, the affidavit alleges. Another similar operation was carried out by the FBI in February 2012, where yet another otherwise incapable patsy was provided with live explosives in the lead up to what was ultimately a failed suicide bombing at the US Capitol. USA Today reported in their article, FBI foils alleged suicide bomb attack on U.S. Capitol, that (emphasis added): According to a counterterrorism official, El Khalifi expressed interest in killing at least 30 people and considered targeting a building in Alexandria and a restaurant, synagogue and a place where military personnel gather in Washington before he settled on the Capitol after canvassing that area a couple of times, the Associated Press writes. During the year-long investigation, El Khalifi detonated explosives at a quarry in the capital region with undercover operatives. He is not believed to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, officials said. The frightening trend of the FBI cultivating otherwise incapable terror suspects, providing them with and detonating real explosives, before giving them inert or controlled devices to carry out attacks on public targets where mass casualties are averted only at the last possible moment, sets the stage for at the very least, incredible potential for catastrophic blunders, and at worst, false flag attacks. Has the FBI ever presided over sting operations that were actually carried out? The answer is yes. The FBI in fact was presiding over the terrorists who carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The role of the FBI leading up to the deadly attack would most likely have gone unreported had an FBI informant not taped his conversations with FBI agents after growing suspicious during the uncover operation. The New York Times in their article, Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast, reported: Law-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an informer said after the blast. The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used, the informer said. The account, which is given in the transcript of hundreds of hours of tape recordings Mr. Salem secretly made of his talks with law-enforcement agents, portrays the authorities as in a far better position than previously known to foil the Feb. 26 bombing of New York Citys tallest towers. The explosion left six people dead, more than 1,000 injured and damages in excess of half a billion dollars. What takes shape is an FBI at the center of perpetuating Americas terror menace, not at the forefront of fighting it. With every attack foiled or carried out involving FBI uncover operatives revealed only after successful stings or in the case of the World Trade Center bombings, an inconvenient witness stepping forward and revealing the FBIs role, the first and foremost suspect considered after any bombing on US soil should be the FBI itself. Recent explosions at the Boston Marathon have left two dead and many more injured. While the public waits to find out who will be blamed and the role, if any, the FBI played in the lead up to the explosions, it would be best to keep in mind the insidious and/or incompetent role the FBI has played during similar events, some of which have occurred recently and in close proximity to the latest explosions. Already some across the Western media are attempting to draw parallels to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York and Washington despite the fact that the US is now deliberately funding and arming Al Qaeda in Syria, as well as openly supporting previously listed terrorist organization, Mujahedeen e-Khalq (MEK), in Iran. Vigilance must be kept against Western governments eager to both exploit and perpetuate terrorism and tragedy as well as manufacture it when necessary.

"Following yesterdays referendum in which 97 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of seceding from Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation, Crimean citizens expressed their excitement Monday at participating in the democratic process one final time. It brought me such great personal joy to head to the polls and, for the last time ever, have my vote tallied and actually mean something, said local businessman Sergei Petrov of his vote in support of annexation by Russia, echoing the enthusiasm of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Crimeans who proudly took part in their final opportunity to assert their collective will at the ballot box. Yesterday was a historic day for Crimea. Our people had a say in their future, and our voices were heard loud and clear, which is extremely special given that it wont happen again for who knows how long. At press time, Crimeans were commemorating the vote to become Russian citizens by eagerly watching and reading coverage of the momentous event in the limited handful of sanctioned media sources they now have available to them.

"A large Southern utility said Tuesday that it would close 30 percent of its North Carolina coal-fired power plants by 2017, a step that represents a bet that natural gas prices will stay acceptably low and that stricter rules are coming on sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain. The utility, Progress Energy, based in Raleigh, said it would close 11 coal-fired power plants built between the 1950s and 1970s. 'Some of these plants are quite old,' said Bill Johnson, the chief executive of the company. But, he added, 'They have a lot of useful life left in them, absent the need to put emissions control units on them.' Johnson also said the company was taking a risk by reducing its output of carbon dioxide, which is not yet regulated, in the near term. He and others expect that Congress will eventually impose a limit on carbon dioxide emissions, possibly in the form of percentage reductions based on a baseline year. By closing the plants now, Progress is effectively cutting its baseline, meaning it may have to reduce emissions even further in the future. 'We need to do the right thing, regardless of that, and this is the right thing,' he said in a telephone interview. If there is a control system added later, he said, 'we'd be making a strong argument, 'Don't penalize us for doing the right thing.' ' While the short-term substitute is natural gas, the long-term plan is a nuclear backbone for the company's generating system, he said. The plants being closed, at four sites, have a combined capacity of nearly 1,500 megawatts. Progress has spent more than $2 billion to put state-of-the-art controls on 2,500 megawatts of coal generation, the company said. And it has already announced plans for one new gas-fired plant and will soon announce additional plans, the company said. Progress is also planning to build two nuclear reactors in North Carolina and two more in Florida, but none will be in use by 2017. Gov. Bev Perdue said in a statement that the announcement by Progress was important for the state's air quality. 'The transition toward cleaner sources of energy is good for the environment and the economy,' she said. Progress said it might repower some coal-burning plants with wood waste. It does not anticipate large-scale wind or solar power in the near future, Johnson said. There is good wind offshore, but the area routinely experiences hurricanes that are stronger than existing wind machines can handle, he said. Duke, another utility that operates in North Carolina, is closing some coal plants but is building a new one. ",1
"President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil is fighting for political survival as calls for her impeachment grow louder amid a widening corruption investigation and a tanking economy.Astonishingly, however, she appears to have felt she had political capital to spare last week when she appointed her predecessor and political mentor, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, to be chief of staff, a move that largely shields him, for now, from prosecution in the corruption scandal involving his ties to giant construction companies.Ms. Rousseffâ€™s explanation was tone deaf and ridiculous. She characterized the appointment as an opportunity to bring back to the government a maverick politician and talented negotiator to help Brazil contend with an assortment of crises, including the spread of the Zika virus.â€œIf Lulaâ€™s arrival strengthens my government, and there are people who donâ€™t want it strengthened, then what can I do?â€ Ms. Rousseff said.Ms. Rousseff has now created yet another crisis, one of confidence in her own judgment. Mr. da Silva, who led Brazil from 2003 to 2010, has been dealing with charges of illicit self-enrichment since he left office. Close associates, including his former chief of staff, JosÃ© Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, and the former treasurer of the ruling Workersâ€™ Party, JoÃ£o Vaccari Neto, are in prison for corruption.Early this month, investigators raided Mr. da Silvaâ€™s home and took him into custody for questioning. Prosecutors then sought to arrest him, accusing him of having accepted $200,000 worth of renovations for a beachfront property investigators believed he planned to occupy. Federal prosecutors are also investigating whether the millions of dollars Mr. da Silva and his foundation have received from companies linked to the scandal surrounding Petrobras, the national oil company, were actually bribes.Mr. da Silva, a leftist leader, says he is not guilty and is entitled to his day in court. But he and Ms. Rousseff want to delay that day for as long as possible by giving him the protections from prosecution that cabinet members enjoy.Roughly 50 officials â€” including politicians from other political parties â€” have been implicated in the Petrobras scandal, and Brazilians are rightly disgusted with their leaders. This latest move by the governing party sent protesters to the streets to demand Ms. Rousseffâ€™s resignation and to express their outrage at what amounts to blatant cronyism. If her latest blunder pushes the impeachment effort across the finish line, Ms. Rousseff will have only herself to blame.",1

"Spill a glass of wine on the wooden floor at Abbey Road and the studio triggers an emergency procedure. In this, Englandâ€™s most storied recording venue, change is resisted at a molecular level â€“ and not only because, in 2010, the government listed the building as a heritage site to ward off vampiric property developers. A few years ago, decorators varnished the floor of Studio Two, whose decor is somewhere between a 1950s prep school gym and a ballroom on the Titanic. Complaints quickly followed. The roomâ€™s acoustic resonance, made famous on most of the Beatlesâ€™ albums, had changed. The varnish was promptly chipped off, at vast expense. Since the 1960s, the studio door has been repainted and the seaweed once used to stuff the drapes that hang from the ceiling swapped for a less pungent material. Everything else remains preserved, with monastic reverence.    Related: Final Fantasy XV footage reveals magic, quests and chocobos   As such, the sight of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) tuning up in Studio One on a sweltering September evening in 2016 looks much the same as when Edward Elgar took up his baton during its opening in 1931. There is one key difference: the music performed tonight will not end up on vinyl, film or in a concert hall. It is destined, instead, for a video game, Final Fantasy XV, the next instalment in a series that debuted in 1987.  Concerts at Abbey Road are rare, but this work by the 48-year-old Japanese composer Yoko Shimomura â€“ who sits on a tidy throne facing the 85-piece orchestra and a 35-piece choir appendage, one of the largest orchestral gatherings in the room since the recording of the soundtrack to Star Wars: Episode I â€“ is far from the first video-game soundtrack to be played here. According to Abbey Roadâ€™s managing director, Isabel Garvey, the medium is an increasingly major component of the studioâ€™s business, as game outfits hope to borrow the scent of its best-known cinematic scores â€“ Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter â€“ that lingers in these old walls. Itâ€™s been a swift invasion. Senior engineer Andrew Dudman, who joined Abbey Road 20 years ago as an intern during his third year of college, remembers the first orchestral recording for a video game, Headhunter, almost 15 years ago. â€œIt snuck under the radar,â€ he says. â€œBut soon after we got Tomb Raider, and suddenly everyone here started paying attention.â€ The 2003 score Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, written by Peter Connelly and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, was one of the first recorded orchestral video game soundtracks, and was a galaxy away from the bleeps and snicks that had defined the mediumâ€™s music. Since then, blockbuster scores, from Halo to The Sims to Uncharted, have been recorded here at a quickening rate. â€œThese days, game music is expected to be on a level with the films people watch,â€ explains Garvey. â€œThe sound must match the advances in gamingâ€™s visual fidelity.â€    Yoko Shimomura and the LPO perform the Final Fantasy soundtrack at Abbey Road. Photograph: Michael Bowles   Connelly is one of a raft of game composers, like Richard Jacques, who did the Headhunter score, little known outside the industry. â€œSo many game composers have made fantastic careers and youâ€™ve never heard of them,â€ says Dudman. â€œBut now weâ€™re entering the era when film composers are crossing over.â€ Hollywood stalwarts Harry Gregson-Williams and Stephen Barton, who started as Williamsâ€™s assistant, have numerous game scores in their oeuvre, as do Tyler Bates and Ryan Amon. Video-game music is also being aired increasingly in public. Shimomuraâ€™s music was recently performed by the LSO at the Barbican, while a concert of pieces taken from the Game of Thrones-esque fantasy game Skyrim takes place at the Palladium later this month. Game composers are also increasingly attracting acclaim for the work. In 2012, Austin Wintoryâ€™s score for Journey became the first video game soundtrack to receive a Grammy nomination. The LPOâ€™s bluntly titled album Greatest Video Game Music entered the US charts at No 23 â€“ the highest debut for an orchestral recording since the Star Wars: Episode III soundtrack. Five years ago, Mark Robins organised an online campaign to encourage fans of video-game music to vote for their favourite tracks to be included in Classic FMâ€™s Hall of Fame. â€œFilm scores have long made an appearance in the chart, and it didnâ€™t feel right that game scores were completely ignored,â€ he says. â€œClearly people agreed with me, because they responded and weâ€™ve had video-game scores on the chart for the last five years. Plenty of people will say the music is terrible without listening to a bar, just because it comes from a game. But if you play it to them without revealing the source, they often really enjoy it.â€   The pieces don't always feel like they have beginnings and ends. There's less of an arc   There are few differences between recording an orchestral film and video-game score. In both cases, the musicians hunch beneath looming booms, a many-legged creature of points, jabs and vibrato spasms. Tonight, Shimomuraâ€™s soundtrack lurches from timpani rumbles to quivering, naked violin lines, as pushy and memorable as any John Williams theme. In its final context, however, there are key differences. A game score is rarely played in a linear form; instead, it drifts and blends between phrases to match the action. â€œThe pieces donâ€™t always feel like they have beginnings and ends,â€ says Dudman. â€œThereâ€™s less of an arc, because thatâ€™s all done dynamically by the programmers. Film scores have more of a clear narrative.â€ Dudman, who says he doesnâ€™t have time to play games, typically listens to the finished game scores on CD, where theyâ€™re presented in linear form. But he recently had the chance to see one of the scores heâ€™d recorded for Sonyâ€™s gothic masterpiece Bloodborne while on holiday in California. â€œThe music was being mixed at Sonyâ€™s Los Angeles office, and the team was sitting in a 300-seat cinema in the middle of their building. The team was playing the game to make sure the music all worked properly. It was immense.â€   Hear the orchestral score of Final Fantasy XV in this gameplay preview  While packing away his Eberle violin â€“ made in 1786, almost two centuries before the first video game debuted â€“ Philippe HonorÃ©, the former principal violinist with the LPO and guest leader for the nightâ€™s performance, reflects on the music. â€œFor me, thereâ€™s not much that distinguishes video game music from film music,â€ he says. â€œIt fits a particular character, or mood. It can be very beautiful.â€ For some players in the orchestra, Shimomuraâ€™s music has an image-changing effect. â€œI was surprised,â€ says HonorÃ©. â€œI always imagine video games as being quite violent, but this was melodic.â€  Not everyone in the orchestra remains convinced. As we head out into the night, I overhear the loud bits of a conversation between two of the younger players. â€œI think my brother used to play it when he was younger,â€ one woman says to another. â€œOn Nintendo, maybe? So yeah, I was familiar with Final Fantasy, but I donâ€™t play it myself.â€ â€œYeah,â€ her colleague replies. â€œNot my cup of tea.â€  Final Fantasy XV is released on 29 November. ",1
"Updated, 9:02 a.m.Good morning on this august Tuesday.How green is your commute?In this concrete jungle, enjoying a bit of nature on your way to work can be a tough task.But not so for the New Yorkers walking or driving down East 25th Street in Flatbush, Brooklyn â€” on the block between Clarendon Road and Avenue D, to be more specific.Here the sidewalk Linden trees are carefully maintained, their tree pits adorned with pink coneflowers.Planters, made from reclaimed hardwood, join this verdant sight, displaying bright sunflowers, echinacea and amaranth.We spot a pine tree.The front yards and windowsill flower boxes of the blockâ€™s brownstones overflow with black-eyed Susans, begonias, marigolds, ferns, hostas and cannas.The air is scented with thyme, mint and blooming flowers.This morning, this stretch of East 25th Street will be declared the â€œGreenest Block in Brooklynâ€ by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The annual contest drew more than 150 entrants this year.(Judging criteria include use of local plants, sustainable gardening and community involvement, among others.)We meandered along the street with Grace Henry, 49, the block president who lives there among her gardenias, ferns and cactuses.As she passed each house, she removed the dead heads of flowers so that new buds could grow.The shaded block felt cool, even as the city sweated.The women who garden on East 25th Street water neighborsâ€™ plants, clean up after dogs and grow pumpkins, tomatoes and jalapeÃ±o peppers in front of a vacant brownstone in the middle of the block.They are also fierce competitors, known to assess rivals on Vanderbilt Avenue.â€œWe banter with them there,â€ said Mrs. Henry, adding, â€œwe say weâ€™re spying out the land.â€â€œBut we always do some deadheading while weâ€™re there,â€ she continued. â€œWe want to help their gardens grow as well.â€Hereâ€™s what else is happening:â€œIâ€™m gonna soak up the sun: I got my 45 on, so I can rock on.â€Thatâ€™s what Sheryl Crow did, and weâ€™d suggest you do the same before itâ€™s too late.Weâ€™ll have sunshine and crystal blue skies today â€” with a high near 88 â€” but the rest of the week (and weekend) may be laden with clouds, showers and thunderstorms.Oh, summer.â€¢ Get ready: The World Chess Championship is coming to New York.

"CP Scott, the great Guardian editor, demonstrated his genius when he launched the Manchester Guardian Weekly in 1919 to spread his liberal views to people outside Great Britain. It was Scottâ€™s intention thus to reach English readers abroad. Since then we outsiders luckily have had the possibility to read many excellent articles from the daily Guardian in the Guardian Weekly. These days it is nearly impossible to buy a foreign newspaper in Denmark but the Weekly brings us the full view of the world already in the World roundup. Yet I confess that after a quick look through the newly arrived Weekly I start reading Notes & Queries, which often contains very funny points of view. After that I read most of the book reviews where I often find very interesting points of view â€“ some of the reviews have inspired me to write articles in the Danish quality newspaper Jyllands-Posten â€“ yes, the paper with the Muhammad cartoons in 2005 â€“ where I am a freelance reviewer after spending 20Â years as reporter, leader writer and historian. Then I turn to reporting from the whole world and last but not least the Comment pages, where especially I enjoy Timothy Garton Ash, Jonathan Freedland and Martin Kettle. I have never solved a crossword, but I thank the Guardian for all the other great joys in the Weekly.

"The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is suing California over a law forcing the website to remove the ages of actors on request, saying it is unconstitutional.   Related: Should actors be allowed to omit their age from IMDb?   California passed a law in September ruling that â€œa commercial online entertainment employment service providerâ€ would be required to remove details of the age of any of its subscribers within five days, on the request of the subscriber. The law was intended to fight age discrimination in the film industry and had been campaigned for by actorsâ€™ groups. The president of the union Sag-Aftra wrote in August that actors â€œface blatant age discrimination every day as websites routinely used for casting talent force birth dates and ages on casting decision-makers without their even realising itâ€. However, IMDbâ€™s suit (pdf) claims that the law â€œdoes not advance, much less achieveâ€ the goal of reducing age discrimination, and that it violates both the first amendments and commerce clause of the US constitution. IMDb also claims it separately violates federal law â€œbecause it imposes liability on IMDb based on factual content that is lawfully posted by its usersâ€.   Related: A Bechdel test for movie ageism: less sentimentality, more Celia Imrie   The website criticises the state of California for passing the law, saying it has â€œchosen to chill free speech and undermine public access to factual informationâ€. IMDb says it is being unfairly targeted and that the law does not deal with the main cause of age discrimination.  â€œPrejudice and bias, not truthful information, are the root causes of discrimination,â€ the lawsuit says. â€œThis law unfairly targets IMDb.com (which appears to be the only public site impacted by the law) and forces IMDb to suppress factual information from public view. Moreover, the factual information being suppressed from IMDb is available from many other sources.â€ The case claims the law is both too broad â€“ as it includes all film professionals, rather than just those who could expect to be the target of age discrimination such as actors â€“ and too narrow, as it fails to impose the same restrictions on the â€œmyriad other sources of the same informationâ€, such as Wikipedia, Google or specialist websites that list the birthdays of famous people.   Related: Dakota Johnson hits out at 'brutal' Hollywood over ageism   IMDb also says that subscribers to its paid professional service, IMDb Pro, have been able to edit or remove biographical details about themselves on the site since 2010.  The lawsuit asks the court to â€œdeclare that Assembly bill 1687 is unconstitutional and that IMDb cannot be liable for failing to censor factual public information,â€ and to declare a permanent injunction against its enforcement. In 2013, IMDb won a case against the actor Junie Hoang, who tried to claim more than $1m from the site after she alleged she had lost out on roles because the site published her real age. When contacted for comment, the office of Californiaâ€™s attorney general said they were reviewing the complaint.",1
"WASHINGTON, DCThe White House denied rumors of wrongdoing by anyone named Karl Rove Monday, saying the alleged deputy chief of staff does not exist. White House press secretary Scott McClellan. 'To my knowledge, no one by the name of Karl Rove works for this president, his staff, or for that matter, anyone on earth, since he is not a real person,' White House press secretary Scott McClellan told reporters Monday. Despite White House denials, allegations have surfaced in recent weeks that Karl Rove is the man who leaked covert CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity to the press. He is rumored to be President Bush's senior advisor, chief political strategist, architect of the president's 2000 and 2004 election victories, and the current deputy White House chief of staff, as well as a frequent guest on televised political talk shows. 'None of these allegations are supported by the facts,' McClellan said. 'The opponents of this administration have created a mythical figure in order to discredit the president. All they have done is divert attention from the important work at handthe war in Iraq and the war on terror. In doing so, they have dishonored the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform.' 'This time,' he added, 'the Democrats have gone too far.' According to fringe journalist Lou Dubose, author of Boy Genius: Karl Rove, The Brains Behind The Remarkable Political Triumph Of George W. Bush, Rove was born Dec. 25, 1950 in Denver, CO. Dubose alleges that Rove lived in Colorado with his family until 1963, when he moved to Salt Lake City, UT. According to Dubose, the shadowy figure entered politics in college, quickly moving through the ranks to become the chairman of the College Republican National Committee at age 22. [pagebreak] The White House has called such reports 'nonsense.' This rare photo depicts the man Bush Administration critics are calling 'Karl Rove.' McClellan reiterated his denial of Karl Rove's existence 33 times during the press conference. When pressed, he distributed a list of 'real, actual political figures about whom I'd be happy to comment.' The list included only President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta. Rumors of the figure's existence were given a boost early this month when, as part of the official investigation into the CIA leak, a Time magazine reporter named Rove as the source of the leak. 'This is a very clever fiction concocted by those on the other side of the aisle,' Vice President Dick Cheney said. 'It's preposterous at its core.' The phantom advisor has come under heavy fire in recent weeks from critics of the administration, who say he should be fired for his role in the scandal. President Bush has pledged that anyone in his administration found to be involved in the CIA leak will be dismissed. 'There is no such organization as the CIA,' McClellan said. 'This is tinfoil-hat stuff.' Initially demanding that the alleged Rove be fired, Democrats say they are now focusing their efforts on proving the figure's existence. 'I believe this deputy White House chief of staff is real, despite White House claims to the contrary,' Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said. 'But to disprove this wild ghost story, we must begin an exhaustive fact-finding mission, for which I pledge all the time and resources of the entire Democratic party.' ",0
"Russian Cruise Missiles Shot From The Mediterranean Kill 600 Members Of ISIS In One Airstrike [VIDEO] According to recent reports, the Russian military has launched cruise missiles against Islamic State locations in Syria from both the Mediterranean and Caspian seas. One attack alone is believed to have killed over 600 terrorists, according to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. The warships of the Caspian Fleet launched 18 cruise missiles at seven targets in the provinces of Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo, he reported to President Vladimir Putin. All targets were hit successfully. In total, there were 10 warships taking part in the operation. ISIS/ISIL has been taking major hits as a result of the attacks, according to Shoigu, who claims that data on the ground shows that the flow of terrorists arriving in Syria has decreased and more and more militants are fleeing the warzone to head north and south-west. Over the past few weeks, Russian air forces have conducted 522 sorties, and deployed more than 100 cruise missiles and 1,400 tons of bombs of various types. We stopped supplies of 60,000 tons of oil per day to the black market and terrorists are losing $1.5 million daily, Shoigu continued. They have also reportedly destroyed 23 jihadist training camps, 19 plants producing explosives, 47 ammunition depots, as well as many other targets. We have a lot of evidence that Russian airstrikes are effective, Syrian Brigadier General Ali Maihub told reporters. Russian mass airstrikes did irreparable damage to international terrorist organizations in Syria, disrupted their administration and financing systems and destroyed their bases and depots. At the moment, there is no plan for offensive action on the ground. What do you think? Do you support Russia going after ISIS? ",0
"Donald Trump Makes Massive Presidential Announcement... This Is Going To Change Everything Yesterday, President-elect Donald Trump spent his day in South Florida, working through issues in his transition to the White Housewhich also includes a new deputy national security adviser, a potential Commerce secretary, and a public battle over who will be the next Secretary of State. On Friday, Trump filled two staff slots, naming veteran Washington D.C. campaign finance attorney Don McGahn as White House counsel and Kathleen Troia McFarland as deputy national security adviser, USA Today reports. Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law, Trump said in a statement about his choices. He will play a critical role in our administration and I am grateful that he is willing to serve our country at such a high-level capacity. McGahn also released a statement, saying that Trump is a bold leader committed to draining the swamp in Washington and restoring economic prosperity and security. Moving forward, McGahn will likely be at Trumps side helping him navigate possible conflicts between his presidential duties and his business interests worldwide. McFarland is a veteran national security analyst and Fox News commentator, and she will work next to National Security-Adviser-designate Michael Flynn. She has tremendous experience and innate talent that will complement the fantastic team we are assembling, which is crucial because nothing is more important than keeping our people safe, Trump noted. McFarland was an official during the Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan administrations. More recently, she has expressed her concerns about Obamas foreign policyand particularly his approach to terrorism. In her statement, McFarland said that nobody has called foreign policy right more than President-elect Trump, and he gets no credit for it. Trump is also expected to nominate billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce, who will likely propel his campaign against existing free trade agreements. During Trumps campaign, Ross told CNBC that he backed Trump because middle-class and lower middle-class America has not really benefited by the last 10 to 15 years of economic activity and theyre sick and tired of it and they want something different. Ross is a controversial choice for Trump, with critical calling him the king of bankruptcy but that is largely due to his history of buying businesses and selling them. Trump is expected to resume his interviews of prospective appointees on Monday, USA Today reports. Dr. Ben Carson has also said he is considering an offer for Trumps cabinet as well. ",0
"UK Officials Would Protect Interests In Iran/Israel ConflictKeelan Balderson, Contributor Ahead of these talks it was curiously leaked that British Minsters were working on how to protect the UKs interests should a military conflict between Israel and Iran arise. Of course talking heads on BBC News this morning made it clear that it would be innocent little Israel protecting itself from Iran, even though Israel is already assassinating scientists and officials within Iran [1], infecting its infrastructure with computer viruses [2], backing opposition terrorists groups [3], and supplying dubious intelligence to the IAEA [4], despite being a nuclear state itself that isnt even signed up to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. Anyone with a modicum of critical thinking knows who the real aggressor is. Should Israel take this further and outright strike Iran, instead of rebuking them for kicking off World War 3, theBBC reports that the UK Government have discussed how they can lend diplomatic support for Israel and the legalities of sending the Royal Navy in to the region to protect the Straits of Hormuz through which more than a fifth of the worlds oil shipments are carried. The timing of this leaked national security information can only be regarded as more saber-rattling, a tactic Iran have called futile. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said this morning that the Pacts policies of pressure and intimidation are futile [5]. They have to adopt policies to show goodwill to solve this issue. Meanwhile sanctions are being stepped up against Iran that will cause a knock-on effect throughout Europe, as the EU will follow the US by banning the purchase of Iranian oil. This however will not only put a damper on Irans economy, but hit the pocket of EU consumers, who will face price increases at the pumps. Oil is often one of the major motivations for war, so its highly likely that Iran will somehow get blamed for the rising prices and disruption of shipments, despite it almost certainly being Israel who make the first overt attack, and the Anglo-Americans being the ones refusing to do business. According to NPR Iran is stockpiling its output of oil, but will soon reach a point where it literally has nowhere to put it. The writer speculates that this will force Iran to cooperate on its weapons program, but as weve consistently documented, there isnt a weapons program, so what exactly can they cooperate on? The aimless talks and propaganda continue.

"Out of Order: Thousands of ATMs have been Cleaned out In GreeceBy Joshua Krause So theyre doing everything they can to insulate themselves from the potential collapse of their financial system, which largely includes taking their money out of the system. Earlier today, sources in the banking industry told Reuters that over one-third of the ATMs in the country, have been completely cleaned out. Between 500 and 600 million Euros were withdrawn from the machines on Saturday, which managed to deplete over 2000 ATMs. Despite the alarming trend, the Greek government has claimed that everything is just hunky dory, and that there will be no capital controls imposed on bank accounts next week. But the Greeks arent buying it, or at least theyre not taking any chances with what little money theyve managed to accumulate since the last financial crisis. Shortly after Prime Minister Tsipras announced there would be a referendum on austerity, Greek citizens left their homes in droves and started lining up behind ATMs at around 2am. No matter what the government and the banks tell them, the Greeks clearly have no confidence in the system. Greece could be very well the trigger to collapse the entire financal system. it wise to think about options converting your entire money into solid goods / property /metals etc. Greece could join the BRICS be involved with New Silk Road Asian Investment Bank. Thus be independent from the Anglo-American Financial system. Unless there is a contrived coup on the Government as in Ukraine, Chile, Iraq etc etc.then the Anglo American system of debt can dig a hole even deeper for them with high interest loans privatisation of the peoples utilities, roads etc.. the usual modus operandi.

"GLENDALE, Ariz. â€” When Ofelia CaÃ±ezâ€™s relatives see her coming, they do almost anything they can to avoid her and her incessant reminders to vote. They dart out of the room. They pretend to be busy. â€œThey close the door,â€ Ms. CaÃ±ez, a 65-year-old Arizona Democratic Party field organizer, said here recently, wearing a satisfied smile and a Hillary Clinton button the size of a tea saucer.Grandmothers like Ms. CaÃ±ez â€” abuelas, as they are known in Spanish â€” are at the front lines of the Democratic Partyâ€™s effort to overcome a stubborn paradox: Hispanics have been voting in record numbers but have also stayed home in record numbers, as their voter participation continues to lag their population growth.And one way to help drive more of them to the polls, Democrats believe, is by courting the â€œabuela vote,â€ and leveraging the unique influence and respect that older women command among Hispanics.Armies of abuelas are out by the hundreds in states like Arizona, Nevada and Colorado, an initiative rooted in experience and research showing that the best mobilizers are often not popular politicians or celebrities, but the people a target audience knows very well.â€œWeâ€™ve been studying and trying to understand who the most effective influencers are to turn out the vote,â€ said Lorella Praeli, director of the Clinton campaignâ€™s Latino outreach program. The answer, she said, was staring them in the face: â€œYou donâ€™t question what Grandmother has to say.â€Abuelas may not quite be a new kind of political boss, but with expansive and interconnected social and family networks, the ones working on Mrs. Clintonâ€™s behalf are persuasive messengers. They are matriarchs of families that often have multiple generations living under one roof. Outside, many are leaders of church groups or organizers of social and civic gatherings of women.That Mrs. Clinton could become the first female president, several said in interviews, makes their activism feel especially urgent.Ms. CaÃ±ezâ€™s son and daughter are conservative, she said, but she has forced Clinton campaign literature on them and wears her Hillary buttons whenever she sees them. â€œIâ€™m here every day and will be here every day,â€ she said during an afternoon shift at a state Democratic Party office in Glendale, a Phoenix suburb. â€œThis is a very personal campaign for me. For all of us.â€Here in Arizona â€” a state with a large Hispanic population that is already voting â€” the Clinton campaign and the state Democratic Party have used abuelas, and more conventional tactics, to turn a deep-red state into one where Mrs. Clinton has pulled close to Donald J. Trump in polls.Close to half of the Arizonans expected to vote have already cast ballots; registered Democrats in early voting are within a few percentage points of Republicans, who have carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1952. Women have constituted 54 percent of all early voters. Mrs. Clinton will make her first campaign appearance in the state, on Wednesday in Tempe.Nationally, the Democratic abuela outreach is a more formal, centralized version of what has happened on the local level for some time.In Nevada, Natalie Montelongo and Vanessa Valdivia, two young volunteers, recognized the power that Hispanic mothers and grandmothers wielded in driving turnout last year when they were organizing Democrats for the presidential caucuses.After watching how women came into their office asking to register their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, the two developed an approach that combined grass-roots politics with Mary Kay-style marketing: Each Hispanic woman who signed up pledged to recruit five friends, who would each recruit five more.Ms. Montelongo and Ms. Valdivia were so successful that the Clinton campaign hired them both. And they are now working in Colorado, trying to replicate their efforts in the heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around Denver.â€œThis opens a door that wasnâ€™t open to us before,â€ Ms. Montelongo said. It does not hurt, she added, that the abuelas are seldom wallflowers.â€œTheyâ€™re not afraid to be direct,â€ she said. â€œThey have the harder conversations that we canâ€™t always have with people who we want to be supporters.â€She offered a bit of advice gleaned from personal experience: â€œDonâ€™t mess with them.â€Turnout among Latinas, and among minority women more broadly, is one of the more overlooked aspects of a presidential campaign that has focused so much on swaying white, college-educated women. But minority women were a critical factor in President Obamaâ€™s 2012 re-election. Black women turned out at a rate of 70 percent â€” higher than any other group. Latina turnout was 50 percent, exceeding Hispanic male turnout by four percentage points.Three-quarters of women newly eligible to vote since 2000 have been minorities, according to an analysis of census data published by the Center for American Progress, and Latinas made up the biggest chunk. There are now at least 5.9 million more of them who can vote than there were when George W. Bush was first elected â€” an 83 percent increase. At the same time, population growth among white women has plateaued.The trend is especially pronounced in Arizona, where the Latina voting-age population has grown by almost 70 percent since 2000. In a sign of their nascent political power and high level of engagement, Latinas here have made up a larger share of the electorate in midterm elections, when far fewer people vote on the whole, than they have in presidential years, the Center for American Progress said.â€œThereâ€™s a saying that I never forget,â€ said Barbara Valencia, 64, a retired college administrator who lives in Tempe. â€œYou educate a man, you educate a person. You educate a woman, you educate a family.â€ Ms. Valencia, like Ms. CaÃ±ez, is part of a group of Hispanic women in their 50s, 60s and 70s who are working with the state Democratic Party to bolster turnout in their communities.It has not been easy, for a variety of reasons. Indifference about voting can be pervasive and hard to crack, these women said. In families that are first-generation American, which can sometimes include undocumented immigrants, there is often a sense of unease about interacting with the government. And the 27.3 million Hispanics of voting age are, by and large, younger than their black, white and Asian-American counterparts. Some 44 percent of Hispanics eligible to vote this year are millennials, according to projections from the Pew Research Center.In fact, much of the growth in the Hispanic voting-eligible population is coming from people who are turning 18, making the pool of available voters not just unreliable but also often unregistered.Mary Rose Wilcox, 66, who in 1982 became the first Latina elected to the Phoenix City Council, said she fights apathy every day.She recalled how, early in Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign, she grew so offended by his remarks about Mexican immigrants that she emailed her five sisters and told them that they could not sit this election out.â€œI told them, â€˜Itâ€™s time, ladies,â€™â€ she said. â€œWeâ€™ve got to make sure all our kids are registered, all their friends are registered, and weâ€™ve got to get them out.â€But the Trump fear factor actually might not be as potent as Democrats hoped. In a survey published in September, Univision asked voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Nevada whether they believed Mr. Trump would deport all undocumented immigrants. Only about a third of voters replied that they did.Which leaves it to abuelas like Ms. Wilcox to use their powers of persuasion.Those powers are especially important in bridging the generational divide in families that are not new to the country, because second-and third-generation children are often far removed from the struggles of their immigrant elders.â€œYou have to bring them back down to reality,â€ Ms. Wilcox said of her grandchildren, some of whom work for her in the small chain of Mexican restaurants she owns with her husband.â€œI said, â€˜If you donâ€™t vote for Hillary, youâ€™re out,â€™â€ she said, laughing.",1
"Shock Report: More Americans Killed by Police Since 9/11 than Soldiers Killed in WarBy Matt Agorist Thousands of families grieve daily for their fallen loved ones and the war machine that sent them to an early grave shows no signs of slowing. These fallen military men and women, we are told, died fighting for our freedom. The terroristshate our freedom,George W. Bush famously said after 9/11. And, if this was true, they certainly have little reason to hate us now, as Freedom in America has plummeted since that fateful September day. For the last 15 years, America has fallen across the board in indices rating the worlds countries by levels of freedom. Americans are under constant surveillance, our every move under a microscope by government goons, protecting us from terrorists. We are under the constant threat of violence from the state forpossessing a plant, or having a tail light out, or simply walking down the street. Americans are constantly paranoid of those blue and red lights popping up in the rearview mirror that most always end in extortion and could very well end with a visit to the hospital, being locked in a cage, or worse. In the Land of the Free, police killed more people in just one month of this yearthan the United Kingdom has in theentire 20th century. In the Land of the Free, police kill at more than 70 timesthe rate of other first world nations. In the Land of the Free, we are told to fear the terrorists but US police kill58 timesmore people than all terrorist activity against US civilians since 9-11! Whats more, while the death of 5,000 soldiers is most assuredly tragic, that number pales in comparison to the number of US citizens killed by police many of whom are also soldiers. Simple math would show us that since 9/11, at the FBIs rate, police killed more than 7,000 people. However, that number is even higher now that places like Killed By Police, Cop Crisis, and the Counted exist and detail every public killing by American police. Using the most recent numbers from 2013 to the present, and remaining conservative by using the FBIs loosely contrived number of 500 per year before then, the death toll reaches a whopping 8,296. But these people are criminals, right? They deserve to be killed, right? Wrong. While many of the citizens whove been killed by police in the last 15 years may have had it coming, all of them deserved due process. Not too mention, many of those killed simply came across the wrong cop while engaging in non-violent victimless crimes like ingesting an illegal plant. Whats more, some of these victims are innocent children like 6-year-oldJeremy Mardis of Louisiana. There is no doubt that criminals exist and present a danger to others. However, when the number of people killed by their own government vastly surpasses the number of people who died fighting for that government in foreign wars something needs to be said. Some will say that since the US is much larger in population than the UK, that is why American cops kill more. But this is a farce. To expose this farce, we can compare the US with communist China. China, whose population is 4 and 1/2 times the size of the United States, recorded 12 killings by law enforcement officers in 2014. Law enforcement in the United States killed 92 times morecitizens in the same period. We will not pretend that cops in the US kill 70 times more people than other first world countries for one simple reason. However, part of the multifaceted situation which has led to the trigger-happiness of American cops is their training. This excessive violence has gotten so bad that American police chiefs are being sent to Scottland to learn steps to change this deadly paradigm. A former hostage negotiator with the Boston police department, Chuck Wexler brought a team of cops across the pond in a last stitch effort to curb killer cops and his story was documented by Sky News. According to Sky News: As the two sets of police officers met, MrWexler described how if confronted by a suspect holding a rock an American officer would pull out his gun. Youre going to kill someone for throwing a rock. Thats what youre gonna do, said MrWexler. How would society over here think about you shooting someone with a rock? They would not accept it. The senior American officers, from forces such as the NYPD and LAPD, watched demonstrations at Police Scotland training centres. Sky News cameras joined them as they went out on patrol in Glasgow, and watched as unarmed police dealt with a variety of potentially violent situations. What the report showed is that cops in Scotland know how to avoid confrontation. Instead of immediately resorting to deadly violence, the Scottish cop will step back, use protective shields, or move behind a car for protection. What the report also found is that American police have a knack for verbally escalating situations too. Sergeant Jim Young trains hundreds of Scottish police recruits every year. The American style of policing, its very authoritative, he said. Theres a difference of going in, straight up at this level, whereby youre ordering people, youre shouting at them. You cant go anywhere after that. But if you start down low you can adjust your communications to suit. Basically, what this experience is showing is that American police are aggressive both verbally and physically and its deadly. The good news is that there are cops out there that know this and they are taking action, like the chiefs going to Scotland, to correct it. Its about time that we step up and this is our chance, said Mr.Wexler. Its a crisis but its also our chance to do the right thing. Below is this eye-opening video of American cops learning to be less violent. This training cannot happen soon enough as America is already on track to kill another 1,000 citizens in 2016. Matt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA. This prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the American police state. Agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world. Follow @MattAgorist Yeah yeah yeah got the whole killer cop narrative already. But why arent you drawing attention to why we have killer cops to start with? When people seem to think they need governmental permission (read: legal) for everything and use power of making laws to manipulate others, you will always have some that are the whacking stick. That is the police. IF police had 95% less laws to enforce and excuses to encounter private citizens AND were held accountable for their actions by their communities, there would be drastically less crime and less police violence. IMO (I repeat:)After 9-11 the Police Captains of America were wined dined on taxpayer paid junkets to Israhell trained/inculcated by the Mossad to treat Americans just like they treat the Palestinians with the escalating violence of pursuing imaginary terrorists under the edicts of the dual-citizen (Kagan) Khazarian/Ashkenazi Zionists in collusion with imperialistic American 1st families (Bush et al), that helped orchestrate 9-11 with the hijacking of the US Federal Govnt. hence the militarized stasi/fascist police state that has engulfed us all as were all now under the heels of their boots echoing on the cobblestones.. dressing them in demonic black uniforms granting them a plethora of military ordinance to the aforementioned Police Captains all over America.so put your horses in the wagon because its all been downhill since 9-11. you nailed it! Police will end up at the wrong door. Kill everyone inside then tell the MSM its a tragedy. .To establish dominance it is very important to discharge your fire arm so at least shoot the dog. when they said that everything is in reverse, it is absolutely true, not only that all the good guys are inside, and all the bad guys and serial killers are wearing uniforms. Stupid statement. it is also like the story yesterday, about protecting Donald trump from hitmen, I do not think that there is anything worry about there, they only kill the good guys and the crap always get left behind. then hillary will live forever.. lets do the math on bad guys.. how many people did trump allow to be MURDERED in Benghazi.. well wait while you do the math.. How many peoples lives have been lost to feed Trumps ego over the years? Trump is a selfish egomaniac. Why do you even think he is a good candidate? Because he opposes that Jezebel- spirited woman Hillary Clinton? well lets see the documentation that supports your lie? no one died because of trump.. cant say that about hillary though, can you! How did I lie? Do you actually want to defend the position that Trump IS NOT selfish and an egomaniac? Did I lie when I asked you the question, Why do you even think he is a good candidate? Then I offered an answer to that question with a tentative, because he opposes that Jezebel-spirited woman Hillary Clinton. I would like to get a sign that says HILLARY FOR THE PILLORY though YOU stated How many peoples lives have been lost to feed Trumps ego over the years? as though someone has died because of him, that is a lie. You assumed die, but there are other ways to lose your lifelike everything you worked to get your whole life. Remember back when Trump was making this really big casino on land that just so happened to already have homes and inhabitants on and Trump used his influence and money to displace them. Were you to make my statement to them, do you think they would have lovely things to say about Trump? YOU, desertspeaks, need to go back in the WAAAAAAY BACK MACHINE and read, watch old interviews, etc. with da Donald. Go back to the 80s and 90s. I think you may be enamored by Trump simply because you lack benefit of a longer memory of what he has done in the past. so no deaths,.. Im not enamored by trump YOU ASSUME so though! The Waaaaay Back Machine. I like that. May I plagiarize you if I find occasion? My father said that Obama is a post turtle. You knowwhen you see a turtle balanced on top of a fence post, you know 3 things: Maybe all the politicians have been post turtles for some time. Only recently I heard this term, Post Turtle, I think from Jim Marrs, a Texan of course. Thanks for the reminder. JWC We, my bumpkin classmates and I, had a beautiful teacher brought to us in the 7th grade. He turned us into a joyous learning machine. Naturally they fired him at the end of the year. I went to see him once to thank him and at that time he had just quit teaching. Last I heard he was a hermit living alone in a hotel room in Seattle and would see and talk with no one. He was a beautiful and loving boy and they ruined him. So, let that be a lesson to you if you ever get discouraged. Just say no, not me, and as my mentor used to repeat like the times tables, keep on keeping onperseverance being fundamental as Blake and many others said: If the fool would only persist in his folly he would become wise. Again, thanks for the post turtle reminder. JWC There are multiple problems. Firstly, cops that break the law need to be persecuted and severely because they are in a position of power. Next, those throwing the rock should be shot for being trouble makers. Who thinks they can throw a rock at police and be ok with that? Is the cop supposed to run away? How stupid. If I was a cop I would not let crazy people attack me. What if he hits you with the rock and then takes your gun and shoots you and others? All corruption needs to be dealt with severely. Allowing those who do bad things to get away with it will just breed more trouble makers. What if? So you think anyone who throws a rock should be shot, and that is ok? How about maybe just cut the rock throwers arm off, but only for 1st time offenders? I meant to say with rubber bullets, not killed. If you go to Singapore you will not see any grafitti because they will severely cane you for doing so. Maybe the scum in the inner cities need to stop committing crimes. Then it is possible that they wont be shot dead quite so often. Really, how many of the people shot by police were not involved in committing some type of crime and then resisting arrest afterwards? What isnt a crime these days? you mean like Tamir Rice in the Cleveland Park, what was he, a 13 yr. old boy with a toy gun in pants, who was shot within 2 seconds of police cruiser arriving?? SHOT DEAD! Many more like this if one reads. Allowing those who do bad things to get away with it will just breed more trouble makers. We can start with LEOs.and thats ALL of themever seen on cop cuff anothernope. Pure Bull! This is the meme of the Obama administration and his attack on Police to help his set of criminal blacks he has unleashed on society. Police are not killing everybody. They are trying to keep the people safe under impossible conditions because the national government is on the side of black criminals and black revolutionaries. Since 2001, there have been approximately 225,000 murders, as in homicides committed everyday Americans against other everyday Americans, in the U.S. So you may want to conduct an in-depth analysis of human nature before you continue using biased and partial statistics to make dumb people (i.e. most of the people in this forum) buy off on your narrative that people are being slaughtered by a blood-thirsty, tyrannical police force ",0
"8 Events That Prove Your Money Is Not Safe In Europe, Or AnywhereJeff Berwick Well, wonder no more, because the following eight events might give you an idea of where governments go to get a little extra cash. 1. In March, 2009, Ireland seized 4bn from its Pension Reserve fund in order to rescue its banks. In November 2010, the remaining savings of 2.5bn was seized to support the bailout of the rest of the country. 2. In December, 2010, Hungary told its citizens that they could either remit their private pension money to the state or lose their state pension funds (but still have to pay for it nonetheless). 3. In November, 2010, the French parliament decided to earmark 33bn from the national reserve pension fund FRR to reduce the short-term pension scheme deficit. 5. In the Spring of 2013 Cyprus took it a step further and outright confiscated up to 50% of the funds from bank account holders in that country. 6. In the Fall of 2013 the Polish government announced it would transfer to the state (aka. confiscate) the bulk of assets owned by the countrys private pension funds (many of them owned by such foreign firms as PIMCO parent Allianz, AXA, Generali, ING and Aviva), without offering any compensation. 7. In February 2014, Italian banks were ordered by the Italian government to withhold a 20% tax on all inbound wire transfers. Il Sole reported, the deductions will be automatic (unless prior request for exclusion), and then it will be up to the taxpayer to prove that the money is not in the nature of compensation income.' 8. The savings of all 500 million Europeans can bestolen by the European Union. Why? Because the financial crisis is not over, according to an EU document. The Commission is looking to ask the blocs insurance watchdog in the second half of 2014 for advice on how to draft a law to mobilize more personal pension savings for long-term financing, the document said. So you see, European governments and institutions have already begun seizing private pension funds, slapping 20% taxes on all incoming wire transfers, confiscating up to 50% from private bank accounts and even stating all the savings of Europe are fair game. As weve said before, this phenomenom of wealth confiscation wont stay confined to Europe. The US has also taken measures to ensure ease of access to the funds of everyday Americans. Weve said for many years now that the US government and almost all Western governments are bankrupt. This means they will try to confiscate as much wealth as possible from people who dont carefully save before the collapse. Mark our words: US 401ks and IRAs will be nationalized in the next four years as wellmaybe as soon as the next one or two years.

"There can be no doubt that Tottenham have the defence to win the title, given that it has taken them 10 matches to concede from open play this season, but Mauricio Pochettino needs his team to be as slick up front as they are stingy at the back if they are going to last the pace. This was another blunt attacking performance from Tottenham, who lost ground on their rivals at the top after one slip allowed Leicester to cancel out Vincent Janssenâ€™s penalty. Strange though it sounds to say that Pochettino has constructed the best defence in England after a game that featured the lively Ahmed Musa capitalising on Victor Wanyamaâ€™s error to earn Leicester their first away point of the season, to argue otherwise would be disingenuous. Instead that loss of concentration reminded Spurs that teams are always vulnerable when their attack does not carry enough of a threat. Tottenham have scored 14 goals, nine fewer than Arsenal and City, and although they are likely to improve when Harry Kane recovers from his knee injury, Pochettino wants his creative players to play with more aggression and belief in the final third. â€œWe need to be more clinical,â€ Tottenhamâ€™s manager said. â€œWe need to score more.â€ It is not a crisis. Spurs remain unbeaten, after all. But they have gone five games without a victory in all competitions, failing to win since outclassing City at the start of the month, and they have scored twice in their past three league matches. While Pochettinoâ€™s side had chances, hitting the woodwork in both halves, there was never a sense that Leicester were under siege. This was a return to the solidity of last season from the champions. Organised and determined, the willingness of Claudio Ranieriâ€™s players to throw their bodies in the way of countless shots heightened Tottenhamâ€™s frustration and ensured that Leicester were able to begin the healing process after their dramatic collapses at Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. Despite falling behind when Robert Huthâ€™s foul presented Janssen with the opportunity to give Tottenham the lead from the penalty spot shortly before half-time, Leicester responded impressively instead of switching their focus to Wednesdayâ€™s trip to FC Copenhagen and Ranieri praised his teamâ€™s spirit, which was typified by Danny Drinkwaterâ€™s urgency in midfielder. The Italian was a vocal presence in the technical area, hollering at his players, urging them to keep their shape and discipline, and scowling whenever someone ignored his instructions. Neither side had anything more than half an eye on their midweek Champions League assignments and the game was full of crunching tackles, energetic running and furious pressing, but there was a need for a change of pace at times, someone to put a foot on the ball and introduce some subtlety. All that blood and thunder made the search for space elusive. Dele Alli crashed a shot against the bar and saw another saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Yet Spurs lacked fluency without their Argentinian midfielder Erik Lamela, who was missing with illness. Son Heung-min probed without success and Christian Eriksen was poor, disappointing with his set-piece deliveries. Leicester looked to Riyad Mahrez for inspiration, regularly working the ball to the right flank in the first half. Danny Rose kept him quiet, however, save for the moment when the Algerian whipped in a cross that Shinji Okazaki glanced narrowly over. Christian Fuchs also rammed a volley over after Mahrez picked him out with a corner. Tottenhamâ€™s breakthrough arrived when Huth, playing with fire, was penalised for hauling Janssen down after an Eriksen free-kick reached the striker after a spot of head tennis. Huth has never been a defender who respects the personal space of his opponents, although Ranieri felt that Janssen initiated the contact and fell softly. The referee, Robert Madley, pointed to the spot, though, and Janssen beat Schmeichel with a firm finish. Leicester have conceded 14 goals in their first five away games. Despite prodding wide in the second half, though, Janssen rarely looked mobile enough to lead the line for Spurs. He has scored three penalties since his Â£17m move from AZ Alkmaar and will need time to adapt to English football, yet the 22-year-old has struggled to fill in for Kane. Although Pochettino said that he is â€œreally happyâ€ with Janssen, he could do with the player he called his main striker. The manager said that Kane has a 50% chance of returning against Bayer Leverkusen at Wembley on Wednesday and a better one of being involved in the much-anticipated visit to Arsenal next Sunday. Tottenham need him fit as soon as possible. Leicesterâ€™s attacking edge will be sharper when Jamie Vardy regains his touch in front of goal. He has gone 11 games without scoring and miscontrolled when Musa sent him clear in the first half. Vardy has plenty of other qualities, however, and he played a key role in Leicesterâ€™s equaliser early in the second half, racing clear on the right after Wanyamaâ€™s careless header and crossing for Musa, who forced the ball past Hugo Lloris at the far post. As a measure of how difficult it is to score against Spurs from open play, perhaps nothing sums it up better than the way Musa had to put his body on the line. The winger briefly lay in a heap in the back of the net after colliding with Lloris, but it was worth the pain. Although Jan Vertonghen sent a late header against the bar, Tottenham could have used some of Musaâ€™s persistence in attack.

"Feds Visit Family Who Googled Backpacks and Pressure CookersBut The NSA Isnt Watching YouDaisy Luther What shows up in your search history? I just checked mine. In the past week I have looked up If you put all these things together, does it put together a picture of a terrorist, bent on destruction, or just a newbie homesteader who is also interested in current events and has a tween daughter? Well, with the algorithms the government is using, those searches might not look so innocent. Michelle Catalano and her husband were the targets of a visit by federal officials based on nothing more than their Google history. While the NSA is fervently denying that they are collecting information on average citizens, an early morning knock on the door of this familys home says otherwise. Do you wonder what would have happened to the Catalanos if theyd refused to answer questions, as is their right under the Constitution? What if they had denied entry when the feds had asked to do a casual inspection of their home, which is also their right? What if the husband had asked, with his morning cup of coffee in hand, Do you have a warrant? I strongly suspect that if they had chosen to stand up for their rights, the intimidating visit would have gotten a whole lot worse. When every thing you do is recorded, analyzed, and judged, you are not truly free. No matter how independent you think you are, someone, somewhere is watching you in a manner so creepy and so intent that no fiction writer has ever captured the full extent of it in even the most gripping spy novel. Many people are careful, not joining social networks, using proxy servers, and using search engines that are supposed to be private. But with the recent release of information from Edward Snowden, I would be willing to bet that isnt enough to keep your internet comings and goings out from under the microscope of the NSA. In fact, those things might make you seem even more suspicious. These algorithms are designed to prove the guilt of anyone that the federal government wants to target. Back in the 1500s, Cardinal Richelieu knew the truth of this when he said, If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged. What kind of world do we live in when you are always watched? When doing things openly makes you a suspect but the pursuit of privacy also makes you a suspect?

"In â€œThe Prison in Twelve Landscapes,â€ a meditation on mass incarceration in the United States, the Canadian filmmaker Brett Story arranges a series of oblique, geographical vignettes into an unsettling mural of systemic damage.You will barely see an actual prison, or hear about an actual crime. But this drifting, at times dreamy documentary follows the tentacles of the confinement industry to stories that hide in plain sight. Like the small playground in Los Angeles constructed purely to prevent paroled sex offenders from moving into a nearby halfway house. Or the enterprising man in the Bronx who runs a thriving business in prison-approved care-package items.Some of the segments possess a strange poetry. In Eastern Kentucky, where new penitentiaries squat atop the pancaked mountains left behind by coal mining, prison jobs are highly valued. What we see, however, is no less than the draining of hope from one group of citizens to benefit another.In this way, Ms. Storyâ€™s unconventional approach provokes responses that a traditional facts-and-figures discussion might not. Yet the filmâ€™s formal abstraction, far from creating emotional distance, is unexpectedly moving. Bracketed by scenes from the overnight bus that takes prisonersâ€™ families from Manhattan to the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York, the movie highlights racial bias with a precision thatâ€™s all the more potent for being refracted.Neither lecture nor argument, â€œPrison,â€ artfully photographed by Maya Bankovic, attempts to make the invisible visible. So when we watch a roaring mountainside fire and listen to an unseen inmate enthuse about her firefighting job, we can immediately sense the awfulness of a life where being surrounded by flames feels like a kind of freedom.",1
"Former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield's exhibition match in Ethiopia has been postponed for September, his opponent Sammy Retta told selfnews on Monday. The fight, to raise funds for AIDS, was set to take place in Addis Ababa on July 26, but organisers had to reschedule after a request from the government. 'The government wanted the match to correspond with Ethiopia's new year celebrations on September 11, so we both agreed,' Retta said in a phone interview. Retta, an Ethiopian-born American, is a 35-year-old with a record of 18 wins and three losses in super-middleweight bouts. At 230 pounds, he now outweighs his more illustrious rival. The bout was also meant to serve as a warm-up for four-time world champion Holyfield, who targeted another crack at the world title in September. Retta however, claimed that the 46-year-old's managers had also postponed that match for an undisclosed date in December. Holyfield failed to clinch a fifth title during his last attempt late last year when he lost to Russian Valuev. Valuev, the tallest and heaviest champion of all-time according to experts, is currently the holder of the World Boxing Association title. The September fight will rank as one of the highest-profile all-American boxing bouts on African soil since the legendary 1974 'Rumble in the Jungle' that pitted Muhammad Ali against George Foreman in the former Zaire.

"by Xinhua writers Hao Yalin, Wang Li GUIYANG, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called for the European Union to have a balanced, objective, comprehensive understanding of the world's largest developing country during an upgraded strategic dialogue held in the underdeveloped province of Guizhou. State Councilor Dai Bingguo told the EU side that despite rapid economic growth, China has no possibility to be arrogant, nor is it pretending to be a richer or poorer country than it actually is, with unfathomable strategic intentions, according to Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying. 'China expects the EU to treat itself as an equal,' Dai was quoted by Fu as telling EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton. The meeting was the fifth strategic dialogue between the two sides and the first since it was upgraded from vice foreign- minister level to its current level. China had made remarkable achievements since its reform and opening up to the outside, but it is still a developing country, Dai said. China has a clear understanding of its position in the international arena and its current level of development, Dai said, adding it will focus on economic development in the long run. China has not been, nor is, nor will be in the pursuit of hegemony, but adheres to the path of peaceful development, Dai said. China needs a peaceful international environment for development and its development will promote global peace and development, he said. Ashton echoed Dai, saying that the European Union should have a comprehensive understanding of China. The EU's view of China's development was one topic of the one-day closed-door meeting. 'It is one major aim of this strategic dialogue to enhance mutual understanding between China and the European Union. Both sides have a strong will to better understand each other and promote political mutual trust, so as to promote bilateral cooperation,' said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying in an interview with Xinhua. The two sides also discussed the international situation and the development of the China-EU relationship. On the international situation, China urged all countries to join hands to cope with global challenges. On China-EU relations, China said it supports EU integration. The two sides should strengthen political dialogue, enhance strategic mutual trust, expand cooperation, properly handle sensitive issues and have more people-to-people exchanges, so as to promote a strategic partnership of cooperation. Ashton said the European Union will strengthen political and economic dialogue with China and seek out more areas for cooperation. 'The two sides found much in common in the talks. The two sides hope to have a better and deeper understanding of each other through more dialogue,' Fu said. On Tuesday, Ashton and her entourage paid a visit to a poor village of the Miao ethnic group in the suburbs of Guiyang, capital city of Guizhou. In the village, they called on rural families and a primary school. Prior to the Guizhou visit, Ashton had a two-day tour in Shanghai Municipality, one of China's most developed cities. 'We hoped such an arrangement would give her a comprehensive understanding of China and help the EU side view China and its development in a balanced and objective manner,' Fu, the vice foreign minister, said. The travel arrangements have been viewed as a response to the suggestion China is no longer a developing country and that it should take on more international responsibilities. Qu Xing, a research fellow at the foreign ministry, said the arrangement helped China and the EU reach consensus about China's development, with which the two sides can have a more comprehensive and balanced view about the China-EU relationship. Ashton's visit to the land-locked Chinese province of Guizhou 'also sent the positive signal that the EU wants to know more about China,' Qu added. China-EU relations have endured some twists and turns in recent years. Nevertheless, facing the changing international situation and global challenges, the European Union adjusted its China policy and now seeks coordination and cooperation with China in some international affairs, Qu said. The EU wants to have a larger voice in international affairs. China wants to keep a multilateral situation. These elements impelled the two sides to further develop their relationship. The two sides do not have fundamental conflicts in interests. This dialogue will help them deepen understanding and further promote the development of China-EU relations, Qu said. After her stay in Guizhou, Ashton flew to Beijing Wednesday evening, where she will meet Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and have talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. ",1
"Donald J.

"How Obama-Monsantos Food Act Destroys Small FarmsRady Ananda Introduced in 2008 by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) as HR-875, the reworked FSMA was signed into law in January 2011 by President Obama. DeLauros husband, Stanley Greenberg, served as a consultant to Monsanto through his strategic political consulting firm, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. (GQRR also advised Tony Blair and Bill Clinton during their campaigns.) Nothing in FSMA addresses the food safety issues of pesticide residue, genetically modified crops, or food miles (which increase the chance of spoilage). But FSMA requires all commercial farms to test the streams used to irrigate their crops. The 1,200 page act was designed to put small family farms out of business, explains Michael Tabor in a recent Farm-to-Consumer interview. Most farmers irrigate their fields from nearby streams. Now those streams have to be tested on a weekly basis. At $87.50 per testing, this increases the cost of doing business by $5,000 a year. Biotech crops and chemical farms get a free pass for polluting our land, air and water table, while downstreamers are required to prove their streams arent contaminated. Hows that for a Catch-22? Extra paperwork and unannounced on-farm inspections by federal regulators, backed by armed personnel, interrupts the workflow and harasses small family farms. Yet, the minute additional paperwork involved in labeling GM foods is too expensive for the biotech industry, or so were told. What a terrifying experience it must be for a farmstead to be raided, while armed agents hold you and your children hostage as they destroy your product which has sickened no one. But thats exactly what is happening to the natural food industry. Theyre treating produce as a high risk food; are they out of their freakin minds? No, theyre not. Theyre systematically criminalizing organic farms and gardens, through the use of bureaucratic rules. Falling in lockstep with the feds, cities across the nation are banning residential gardens and criminalizing charity. Feeding the homeless is considered a nuisance, while church bake sales and community picnics are also being criminalized across this once-free nation. Criminalizing the means for people to feed themselves is a sure fire way to achieve globalist aims of reducing human numbers. Another scary feature of FSMA is that even though its rules are still under public comment (until Nov. 15, 2014), armed inspectors are already arriving at private farms demanding access to the farmers employees as well as the barns, lots and pens. Tabor knows of three surprise inspections that, despite assertions to the contrary, do not have any FSMA authorization because the inspection rules have not yet been finalized. The feds do not have this authority and that they think they do simply because they passed another in a long line of police state acts does not bode well for family farmers in the US. More importantly, he points out, the one area of small farming that is a growth industry is the very niche that FSMA seeks to regulate: the sustainably-produced market. No dictatorship wants people to be self-supporting, successful entrepreneurs. Tabor asks why we need federal intrusion over something humans have done for 150,000 years, without government regulations: feed ourselves and share our food. With guns drawn, Stalins forced farm collectivization resulted in the starvation of millions of people historians estimate that figure between 7 and 20 million. With guns drawn, local, state and federal agents continue to raid natural food stores and the farms that supply them, seizing and destroying their products, though no one was sickened by them. In the US, its physically dangerous and economically risky to produce food outside the toxic industrial food system. Rawesome Food owner James Stewart, a 65-year-old businessman who had never been arrested in his life, was deposited in a Los Angeles County Jail cell with an overflowing toilet. Raw sewage can kill people much faster and more violently than tainted lettuce or milk. His complaints to the guards were ignored, as if they wanted him to eat shit and die. See this two-part interview here and here. Farm and food freedom advocate, Sue Wallis, a Wyoming legislator, died suddenly last week of unknown causes at the age of 56. Nationally known for her humane and utilitarian advocacy of horse slaughter, she remained a strong proponent of food freedom, repeatedly, yet unsuccessfully, introducing legislation to allow direct farm sales with few restrictions. Clearly, the US government intends to protect the most dangerous and toxic food source while driving the smaller food farms out of business. The goal of the industry-owned federal government is for genetically modified crops to capture 100% market share. We can assume that modernization means enabling corporate ag to siphon profits off the 10% market share it doesnt already capture. Whos running the farm? Michael Tabor says its not farmers. Overseers mean youre the slaves, he reminds us.

"Former US president George W. Bush said Thursday that Americans should not fear China's rise and should look for the opportunities presented by the growth of the world's third-largest economy. Bush said, however, that in pursuing stronger ties with Beijing, the United States should not compromise its principles, such as freedom of religion. 'Some people say that we all worry about it -- the growth of China,' Bush told a financial forum in Shanghai. 'They look at China's growth and say: 'This is cause for worry'.' 'I don't believe that. I view it as an opportunity. I view it as a chance to develop a win-win strategy,' Bush said. The former US leader was speaking at a time when relations between the two countries have been strained by arguments over Tibet, Taiwan, Internet censorship and the value of the Chinese yuan. 'I don't believe when you get in a relationship you have to give up your values. When I met with Chinese leaders I expressed my values. I believe a country that encourages freedom of religion is a country that is going to be a more peaceful country,' he said. China's officially atheist communist rulers strictly suppressed religion for three decades after coming to power in 1949. The past three decades have seen a flourishing of many forms of religion but the government continues to maintain tight controls, fearful of the potential challenge to its rule from any kind of large organisation. Worshippers are meant to frequent only state-sanctioned churches. Bush attended such a service during a visit in 2008 for the Beijing Olympics. ",1
"Under Mendel's laws of inheritance, you could thank mom and dad equally for all the outstanding qualities you inherited. But there's long been some fine print suggesting that a mother's and father's genes do not play exactly equal roles. Research published last month now suggests the asymmetry could be far more substantial than supposed. The asymmetry, based on a genetic mechanism called imprinting, could account for some of the differences between male and female brains and for differences in a mother's and father's contributions to social behavior. A person gets one set of genes from each parent. Apart from the sex chromosomes, the two sets are equivalent, and in principle it should not matter if a gene comes from mother or father. The first sign that this is not always true came from experiments in which mouse embryos were engineered to carry two male genomes, or two female genomes. The double male and double female mice all died in the womb. Nature evidently requires one genome from each parent. Biologists then made the embryos viable by mixing in some normal cells. The surprising outcome was that mice with two male genomes had large bodies and small brains. With the double female genome mice, it was the other way around. Evidently the maternal and paternal genomes have opposite effects on the size of the brain. The root of the asymmetry is a procedure called imprinting in which either the mother's or the father's copy of a particular gene is inactivated. The best worked out example concerns a gene called insulinlike growth factor-2, which promotes the growth of the fetus. The IGF-2 gene is active in the paternal genome but imprinted or inactivated in the genome the fetus receives from its mother. The leading explanation for imprinting is a theory that invokes conflict between relatives. Developed by David Haig, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, the theory holds that there is a clash of interests between the fetus, whose purpose is to extract as much nutrition as possible, and the mother, whose interests lie in allocating her resources evenly to all the other children she may bear in the future. Over the course of evolution this conflict has come to be mediated at a genetic level, Haig's explanation goes, because the mother and the father have different interests. Speaking of mammals in general, the conflict is driven by female promiscuity. The mother wants to share her resources among progeny who may have different fathers, whereas the father is interested in the survival of only his own child. So the father always confers the IGF-2 gene in active form and the mother always bequeaths it in imprinted or silent form. The gene is imprinted in mice, humans and many other mammals. It may seem strange to have a genetic tug of war within the fetus, with the paternal copy of the IGF-2 gene always asking for more, and the maternal copy refusing to ask at all, but presumably over the course of evolution the individuals who carried these two warring copies of the gene left more offspring than those with the gene in any other form. Until last month only a hundred imprinted genes were known, and the mechanism seemed just an interesting deviation from Mendelian genetics. Research led by Christopher Gregg and Catherine Dulac of Harvard has shown that imprinting is far more common and more intricate than supposed. Working in mice, the Harvard team showed that around 1,300 genes are imprinted. Dulac said that she expects a substantial, though lesser, proportion to be imprinted in people -- maybe some 1 percent of the genome -- because humans are more monogamous than mice and so the parents' interests are more closely aligned. Dulac was able to detect so many new imprinted genes by taking advantage of the ease with which genes can now be decoded. She cross-bred two very different strains of mice, thus ensuring that the maternal and paternal versions of each gene would have recognizably different sequences of DNA. When a gene is activated, the cell transcribes it into RNA, DNA's close chemical cousin. By decoding all the RNA transcripts in the mouse's cells, Dulac could pick out those genes in which the paternal version was being transcribed much more than maternal version, and vice versa. Besides finding far more imprinted genes than expected, Dulac's team also picked up unexpected patterns in the way the genes were expressed. Maternal genes were more active in the embryo's brain, but paternal genes became more active in the adult. In another novel pattern, she found sex differences in imprinted genes in different region of the brain, particularly those concerned with feeding and with mating behavior. A gene called interleukin-18 is activated from the mother's version in two important regions of the brain. This asymmetry is of interest because the gene in people has been linked with multiple sclerosis, a disease that predominates in women. Altogether Dulac found 347 genes where either the mother's or the father's copy was more actively expressed in certain regions of the brain. Sex differences in the brain are usually attributed to the influence of hormones, but sex-based differences in imprinting may be another mechanism by which nature spins male and female brains out of the same genome. 'In your brain, your mom and your dad keep telling you what to do -- I keep laughing when I think about it,' Dulac said. In the cortex of the brain, Dulac discovered another unexpected asymmetry. Women have two X chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. The usual rule is that in each cell either the mother's or the father's copy is chosen at random to be switched off. But in the neurons of the cortex, there is a much greater chance that the paternal X chromosome will be switched off. 'So again, it's the conflict between mom and dad -- each tries to use different chromosomes to influence you,' Dulac said. Haig says that his theory of imprinting explains not only the tug of war between mother and fetus but also why there are imprinted genes in the brain. It all has to do with the different interests of the mother's family and the father's family, which tug the individual in different directions. Relatives get into the argument because they share varying proportions of an individual's genes. Evolutionary fitness depends on passing one's genes on to the next generation. But it also counts to pass on the identical genes that have been co-inherited by one's siblings, uncles and aunts. The doctrine, known as inclusive fitness, was proposed by the biologist William Hamilton in the 1960s and is widely accepted, though is not without critics. It was challenged last month in the journal Nature by the Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson and two colleagues. Under inclusive fitness, Haig has pointed out, a conflict of interest between the mother's and father's relatives would have arisen because of the different dispersal patterns of men and women. Most often it has been the woman who leaves her ancestral village and goes to live with her husband's family. The maternal genes stand to gain if the woman is as selfish as possible and focuses just on her and her children's welfare. But since the father is related to everyone else in the village, the father's genes will gain from altruistic behavior. Such a conflict will result in imprinted genes, just like the battle between the mother and fetus over the mother's resources, in Haig's view. Two evolutionary biologists, Francisco Ubeda of the University of Tennessee and Andy Gardner of the University of Oxford in England, have devised a mathematical model for assessing the consequences of a woman living in her husband's village, among people to whom she is not related. Natural selection, they say in an article in the current issue of Evolution, will favor the activation of paternal genes that underlie altruistic behavior and maternal genes that promote selfishness. 'Your paternal genes want you to be nicer to your neighbors than your maternal genes do,' Gardner said in an interview. In most people the altruistic and selfish motives operate in some reasonable kind of balance. But the imprinted genes carry a serious vulnerability: Since they are silenced, a mutation to the other copy can be disastrous. Diseases like autism may be connected with disruptions to imprinted genes, Gardner said. Imprinting, far from being a genetic curiosity, may play a central role in sexual differences and in psychiatric disease, if Haig's explanation is correct. Much of the available evidence comes from mice, and people may to some extent have emancipated themselves from imprinting when they evolved the pair bond system of mating about a million years ago. But the pair bond does not mean perfect monogamy, and in its deviations from perfection there is plenty of room for imprinting to thrive. ",1
"copyright 2009, The Washington Post WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar launched the Obama administration's first coordinated response to the impacts of climate change Monday, which he said would both monitor how global warming is altering the nation's landscape and help the country cope with those changes. Salazar will lead a new 'climate change response council' that will coordinate action among the department's eight bureaus and offices. A secretarial order will create eight 'regional climate change response centers' in areas ranging from Alaska to the Northeast and build landscape conservation cooperatives that will create strategies for the eight regions with the help of state and local groups, and other federal agencies. Interior manages one-fifth of the nation's land mass and nearly 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf. 'The Department of Interior must continue to change how it does business and respond to the issues of energy and climate change, which I see as the signature issues of the 21st century,' Salazar said at a news conference. 'The time this department operated under silos is a time that's over.' To curb climate change, Interior will explore methods to sequester carbon by storing it underground and by absorbing it through forests and rangelands, Salazar said, as well as ways to cut the department's own greenhouse gas emissions. He did not, however, specify by how much the agency would reduce its carbon footprint. Kit Batten, science adviser to Interior Deputy Secretary David Hayes, led reporters through an elaborate geospatial presentation that mapped everything from the frequency of large hailstorms and windstorms in the United States to the melting of Washington state's South Cascade Glacier. 'This will help us understand the impacts of climate change, adapt to the impacts of climate change and provide ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as a department,' Batten said. 'This work is important to all Americans, not just scientists and land managers.' Brenda Ekwurzel, climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that while the announcement was not a substitute for a mandatory, nationwide limit on greenhouse gas emissions, it 'means the United States will be much better prepared to respond to the current and coming changes due to global warming. The Interior Department manages 20 percent of the land in the United States, so its role in developing strategies to cope with the unavoidable consequences of global warming is critical and could potentially save lives.' It remains unclear how much the department will devote in additional resources to the effort. Salazar noted that while the U.S. Geological Survey had received $10 million to address climate change through its centers, 'There is additional money that will be needed.' The initiative could change the way Interior employees such as Mike Pellant, Great Basin Restoration Initiative coordinator, does his job. Pellant works on bringing the habitat of the Great Basin -- an area that encompasses tens of millions of acres in Nevada, western Utah, southern Idaho, southeastern Oregon and parts of California -- closer to its natural state. The sage brush steppe that once dominated the landscape is being replaced by invasive cheat grass, which thrives on carbon dioxide and the wildfires that now take place with increasing regularity. Cheat grass plays a major role in roughly one-third of the 80 million acres the Bureau of Land Management oversees in the basin, converting the area from one that absorbs carbon to one that emits carbon into the atmosphere because of the grass-fed wildfires, accelerating global warming. If the department puts a higher priority on carbon sequestration, Pellant expects more public and agency support of the effort to replace cheat grass with sage brush. 'Cheat grass is a carbon source, and we'd rather see (the basin) as a carbon sink,' Pellant said. ",1

"Emma Clineâ€™s first novel, â€œThe Girls,â€ gets off to a quietly thrilling start. The book is set in Northern California over the agitated summer of 1969, and beneath the rhythm of Ms. Clineâ€™s sentences thereâ€™s a freight of submerged dread, as if the universe were keyed to the shimmering of the Doors drummer John Densmoreâ€™s cymbals.Ms. Clineâ€™s protagonist is Evie Boyd, a bored and drifting 14-year-old. Evie grew up under the Hollywood sign, if only figuratively. Her grandmother was a well-known actress, plucked from obscurity Ã  la Lana Turner. With her newly divorced and emotionally brittle mother, Evie lives in an echoing and well-appointed house in Petaluma. In the fall, sheâ€™ll be shipped, like an item scratched from her motherâ€™s to-do list, to boarding school.â€œThe Girlsâ€ is about what happens when Evie wanders into the orbit of a Charles Manson-like cult. This happens slowly, then with disturbing quickness. One day Evie is in a public park holding a hamburger and, she tells us, â€œI looked up because of the laughter, and kept looking because of the girls.â€In this novelâ€™s mesmerizing opening sentences, she continues: â€œI noticed their hair first, long and uncombed. Then their jewelry catching the sun. The three of them were far enough away that I saw only the periphery of their features, but it didnâ€™t matter â€” I knew they were different from everyone else in the park.â€To Evie these girls, who are only a few years older than she is, seem â€œtragic and separateâ€ â€” it is as if theyâ€™re â€œroyalty in exile.â€ Evie begins to notice them around town. Their shabby glamour is so appealing that she can overlook the fact that they reek from Dumpster diving and drive a sinister school bus thatâ€™s been painted black.Never get in the black school bus; unless you are a roadie for Insane Clown Posse, this is a life lesson. But one morning, Evie does get in, her bicycle stowed in back. And she does not climb back out when a girl says: â€œSheâ€™s gonna be our offering. Weâ€™re gonna sacrifice her.â€ (Oh, Evie.) Determined to find herself by losing herself, Evie overlooks many, many things.Scenes of Evie during this unpropitious summer are threaded, occasionally, with scenes of Evie today, in late middle age. All is not well with her. She is an unemployed live-in health aide; she is broke and lonely; she tends to stay in her robe all day. Whatever happened to her out at the cultâ€™s commune has remained with her, like a Gypsyâ€™s curse.When teenagers meet this Evie, they tend to stare in awe and say things like, â€œYouâ€™re that lady?â€ She sits them down and explains that it was a long time ago, that she didnâ€™t kill anyone, that she is barely mentioned in the true-crime books. She wonders herself what she did out there in the woods.Ms. Cline canâ€™t come close to sustaining her novelâ€™s early momentum. After 30 or 40 pages, my enthusiasm for â€œThe Girlsâ€ began to wane. After 60 pages, I was scanning for the exit signs. The storytelling becomes vague and inchoate, as if you are reading a poem â€” a windy poem of the Jorie Graham variety â€” about the novel youâ€™d rather be consuming. This humorless book whispers when you wish it would scream. Its sentences go soft, like noodles in a pot.Itâ€™s not that Ms. Cline doesnâ€™t possess obvious talent. She has an intuitive feel for the interiors of a 14-year-oldâ€™s mind, especially the way that Evie, with her fragile sense of self, becomes party to her own abasement at the hands of Russell, the charismatic cult leader. An â€œexpert in female sadness,â€ Russell knows girls like Evie. They are his â€œbread and butter.â€ Ms. Cline also understands â€” at the start, at any rate â€” how to build layers of suspense by withholding information.Her sentences are often strong and lovely, indicative of voice rather than merely of style. â€œI was wearing a dress that didnâ€™t belong to me in a place I had never been,â€ Evie says at the commune, a line that speaks volumes about her sense of her new life. She is this novelâ€™s Alice, in a grim sort of Wonderland.When sheâ€™s hitchhiking and a man picks her up, she thinks: â€œI should have known that when men warn you to be careful, often they are warning you of the dark movie playing across their own brains. Some violent daydream prompting their guilty exhortations to â€˜make it home safe.â€™â€Too often, though, this novelâ€™s sentences fold in on themselves. Ms. Cline attempts to wring too much meaning from each moment.A bit of obscene graffiti on a bathroom wall isnâ€™t allowed to be merely graffiti, for example. Ms. Cline is compelled to explain what graffiti is. â€œAll the silly, cryptic marks of humans who were resigned to being held in a place, shunted through the perfunctory order of things,â€ she writes. â€œWho wanted to make some small protest.â€ Or maybe they just wanted to crack a stupid joke?Everything in â€œThe Girlsâ€ is pre-elegized. Thesis statements jam this novelâ€™s circuitry, as well. Ms. Cline has a good deal to say about how young women move through the world, except when she tells instead of shows. Then her book simply collapses.An example: â€œPoor girls. The world fattens them on the promise of love. How badly they need it, and how little most of them will ever get. The treacled pop songs, the dresses described in the catalogs with words like â€˜sunsetâ€™ and â€˜Paris.â€™ Then the dreams are taken away with such violent force; the hand wrenching the buttons of the jeans, nobody looking at the man shouting at his girlfriend on the bus.â€And what about Evieâ€™s dreams? She performs sex acts on Russell. She has sex, too, with the grizzled pop star Mitch, whose life will be upended when Russell turns against him. A car, filled with girls and knives, will head one night toward Mitchâ€™s house.Evie will have to decide if, figuratively, sheâ€™s on the black school bus or off it. Mentally, you may have already exited out the back.",1
"People lined up on the veranda of the American mission hospital here from miles around to barter for doctor visits and medicines, clutching scrawny chickens, squirming goats and buckets of maize. But mostly, they arrived with sacks of peanuts on their heads. The hospital's cavernous chapel is now filled with what looks like a giant sand dune of unshelled nuts. The hospital makes them into peanut butter that is mixed into patients' breakfast porridge, spread on teatime snacks and melted into vegetables at dinnertime. 'We literally are providing medical services for peanuts!' exclaimed Kathy McCarty, a nurse from California who has run this rural hospital, 35 miles from the nearest tarred road, since 1981. The hospital, along with countless Zimbabweans, turned to barter in earnest in 2008 when inflation peaked at what the International Monetary Fund estimates was an astonishing 500 billion percent, wiping out life savings, making even trillion-dollar notes worthless and propelling the health and education systems into a vertiginous collapse. Since then, a power-sharing government has formed after years of decline under President Robert Mugabe, and the economy has stabilized. Zimbabwe abandoned its currency last year, replacing it with the American dollar, and inflation has fallen to a demure 3.6 percent. Teachers are back in their classrooms and nurses are back on their wards. But a recent U.N. report suggests how far Zimbabwe has to go. It is still poorer than any of the 183 countries the U.N. has income data for. It is also one of only three countries in the world to be worse off now on combined measures of health, education and income than it was 40 years ago, the U.N. found. 'It's very difficult to get this famous dollar that people are talking about,' said Esther Chirasasa, 30, who hiked 8 miles through the bush to the hospital for treatment of debilitating arthritis. Her son, Cain, 13, walked at her side carrying a sack of peanuts to pay for her care. Patients provide the crops they grow and the animals they raise -- food that feeds the thousands of patients who use the hospital -- and the hospital tends to their wounds, treats their illnesses and delivers their babies. Its two doctors and 15 nurses see about 6,000 patients a month and have put 2,000 people with AIDS on life-saving antiretroviral medicines. ",1

"Marveling at just how far he had come in 56 years, MerCal Enterprises president David Gilford reflected this week on his rise from a humble fertilized embryo to head of a publicly traded multinational company. Speaking from his executive suite, Gilford told reporters that as leader of a business that regularly reports billions in profits, his current station in life is a far cry from his beginnings as a newly formed zygote, when he didnt have single dollar or functioning circulatory system to his name. It wasnt easy at the beginning, just grinding it out for nine long months, said Gilford, noting that immediately following conception he was guided by little more than the cilia that pushed him down the fallopian tube, having never even seen a quarterly report or attended a shareholders meeting. Back then I didnt know which way was up. I was struggling just to work my way toward the womb. But here I am now, an hour away from signing off on the largest acquisition in this companys history, he continued. I sure didnt realize it back then, but when that sperm cell fused with that ovum and endowed me with two sets of chromosomes, it set me on the path to the corner office Im in now. Gilford said he never even entertained the possibility that the differentiated tissue groups he began to form after attaching to the uterine wall would one day lead to him overseeing more than 7,000 employees in 11 global offices. While it now seems obvious that the placental nutrients he was receiving from his mother have been pivotal in his appearing year after year on Forbes list of the nations highest-paid chief executives, Gilford admitted that, at the time, he didnt stand out as anything special. I dont think I screamed future CEO when people looked at me back in those days, said Gilford, who, as a blastula, had only begun developing new non-maternal mRNA. What did I know about negotiating or leveraging? I knew how to fill my central cavity with fluid. Thats what I could do, so I did it. I probably seemed like just another neural groove with a brain bulge, he added. But you cant climb that ladder without the bottom rung. By day 105, however, rudimentary air sacs had begun to develop in the future magnates lungs and his nervous system had gained control over multiple bodily functions, events that Gilford said were absolutely crucial in his acceptance into the prestigious Wharton School and later joining Morgan Stanley as a finance analyst immediately upon graduation. But while he received a compensation package last year of more than $16 million, including cash and stock options, in no small part due to the cartilage, muscle, and bone structures that developed from his mesoderm, Gilford admitted it was not smooth sailing all the way. At week 11, his eyelids suddenly closed for nearly two months, a discouraging setback that Gilford said ultimately helped almost as much as everything that went right. When I think about it, what I went through in those first trimesters helped make me the business leader I am today, he said, speculating that those 38 long weeks instilled in him a sense of patience and the essential cardiovascular functions needed to make his way in the cutthroat business world. One of the most important things in this profession is adapting to changing conditions, and Im a guy who successfully transitioned out of living in a liquid-based environment to breathing oxygen. And I did it entirely on my own. Most important to his success, according to Gilford, has been never taking his good fortune for granted and appreciating how much he has progressed from his simple early days plodding through organogenesis, sexual differentiation, and limb development. Look, I started out with nothing more than a single cell, said Gilford, who makes a point of frequently reminding himself of all those weeks he had to scrape by on whatever was delivered to him through his umbilical cord. And then I managed to double it, double that again, and then double that again. At this point I think Im estimated to have about 100 trillion of them. Not bad for a kid who was briefly in breech presentation, he added. The multimillionaire acknowledged that, despite his own hard work, he did not make it to his current position entirely on his own. According to Gilford, hed never have an apartment on Park Avenue or a 75-foot yacht had his mother not paid attention to her diet and behavior during pregnancy or received such expert care from her obstetrician, both of which Gilford said kept him going when fetal viability seemed a million miles away. And despite his eight-figure salary, Gilford told reporters he has yet to succumb to the trappings of his high status and hasnt forgotten the days when he was covered in a thin layer of lanugo. A lot of people think Ive changed as a person since fertilization, and in some ways maybe I have, he said, reflecting on his increased attention to profit margins as well as his ability to grasp objects. But dont let the hand-tailored suits and my completely fused skull fool you. Deep down, Im still that same pair of gametes, he added. ",0
"Q. What is Yik Yak and what is your job there?A. Weâ€™re a location-based social network used mostly by millennials, especially on college campuses. It has a general radius of between one and five miles. If members change locations, theyâ€™ll see posts, or yaks, of members in the new area. My team develops the natural language processing system that analyzes membersâ€™ posts related to patterns and emotions. My job is to use the analyses to make the app as engaging as possible.Can you give an example?Suppose a member posts, â€œOrdering a pizza for the game tonight.â€ That tells our system that the language is English and the person is talking about food and sports. If the post ends with an exclamation point, the computer interprets that the person is happy. Information like this helps us develop a profile of what that individual might like and recommend other posts.How did you get interested in this field?Iâ€™ve always been interested in languages and technology. Iâ€™m from Catalonia, Spain, which has two languages, Spanish and Catalan. Every language has arbitrary conventions, but there are also universal aspects to languages. Over the years, I became interested in whatâ€™s common among them.What is your educational background?I have a masterâ€™s in computational linguistics and a Ph.D. in language and information technologies.Do you use the app personally?Iâ€™m on it every day for work, but I also use it to stay in touch with the locations I care about. Besides being able to post and view posts related to their location, members can see posts from other locations. I stay in touch with places that I still have an emotional connection with, including Barcelona and areas in Germany, China and Japan.How do you relate to your members when youâ€™re not a millennial?I enjoy working with this age group, I find them refreshing and invigorating. Our founders are millennials. It also helps me keep up with the latest language. I can say â€œon fleekâ€ and â€œsesh,â€ although I donâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll be in fashion.",1
"AT&T reported on Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings were little changed from the first three months of last year, but revenue grew as the wireless business added more than one million subscribers.First-quarter net income totaled $3.65 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with $3.7 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier, when AT&T had more shares outstanding. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs related to its March acquisition of Leap Wireless, AT&Tâ€™s income was 71 cents a share, compared with 64 cents in the 2013 quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of 70 cents.Revenue grew 4 percent to $32.5 billion, better than the $32.4 billion analysts expected, according to FactSet.AT&T added 1,062,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter. That includes 625,000 smartphones and tablets in â€œpostpaidâ€ plans. These are the high-value customers on contracts or long-term installment plans. Wireless service revenue grew 2 percent to $15.4 billion. Total wireless revenue, including phone and tablet sales, grew 7 percent to $17.9 billion.AT&T said its installment plan, Next, was popular and grew during the quarter. Although Next customers are not locked in to conventional two-year service contracts, they pay the entire cost of phones in installments, freeing AT&T from paying hundreds of dollars per customer in subsidies.Among new customers of postpaid smartphones and those upgrading to new devices, more than 40 percent, or about 2.9 million, signed up for Next. That was up from 15 percent in the last three months of 2013.AT&T also has been pushing customers into more expensive plans that offer larger amounts of data, by reducing prices at the high end.â€œCustomers really like the new mobility value proposition and are choosing to move off device subsidies to simpler pricing â€” while at the same time, they are continuing to move to smartphones with larger data plans,â€ AT&Tâ€™s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, said in a statement.In the landline business, revenue fell 0.4 percent to $14.6 billion. But the company reported growth in its newer U-verse product, which offers phone, TV and Internet service. AT&T had 634,000 additional high-speed Internet subscribers and 201,000 TV subscribers.",1
"A Taiwanese lawmaker on Tuesday urged regulators to protect the employees of the Taiwan unit of troubled insurance giant American International Group (AIG) as the parent company solicits new bids for the subsidiary. 'Up to 4,070 employees have been punished and fired since Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. was put up for sale for the first time, ' opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Pan Men-an said at a news conference, with Nan Shan's trade union leaders also present. 'There are many more who have been demoted and the number is still being counted,' he said. He urged Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) , the country's top financial regulator, to list the protection of employees' rights as one of the criteria in reviewing the planned sale of Nan Shan. Nan Shan spokeswoman Amanda Chou dismissed the allegation, saying that some of the employees left the company because they failed to pass performance evaluations. She put the insurer's current workforce at around 33,000. Chou also declined to comment on the timetable for the new sale after the local media reported that AIG had invited four potential Taiwan-based buyers to tender their bids by Dec. 3. The reported suitors are Cathay Financial Holding Co., Fubon Financial Holding Co., Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., and Ruentex Group. In a Nov. 5 statement, AIG said it believed a sale would be completed 'within 12 months.' A previous attempt by AIG to sell its Taiwan subsidiary ended in failure. Taiwan's regulators on Aug. 31 rejected the sale of the unit to a Hong Kong consortium comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic Holdings, on concerns related to the buyer's long-term financial capability and the rights of Nan Shan's workers. The consortium agreed in October 2009 to buy AIG's 97 percent stake in Nan Shan for US$2.15 billion after AIG put the Taiwanese insurer up for sale following a U.S. government bailout. Wedding Lan, a spokesman for Nan Shan's trade union and a former executive who was demoted to sales agent earlier this year for 'speaking to the press about Nan Shan without the prior consent of the company, ' urged new bidders at the press conference to strike a deal with the trade union over the protection of employees' rights. The trade union demanded, for example, that the new buyer should provide labor and health insurance and appropriate pension benefits to all Nan Shan employees and not just those staffing the company's offices, as is the case at present, according to Lan.

"The takeaway from the term that ended last week seems to be that by the time the Supreme Court, short-handed and stumbling in the wake of Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€™s death, finally got its act together at the end of June, it had â€” lo and behold â€” turned liberal.Count me a skeptic.Yes, of course, the two major decisions at the end of the term, University of Texas v. Fisher and Whole Womanâ€™s Health v. Hellerstedt, had â€œliberalâ€ outcomes: Affirmative action in university admissions survived by a margin of a single vote, and womenâ€™s access to abortion, in states trying their best to shut down abortion clinics, survived by a margin of two. Empirical political scientists code these results as liberal.But to understand the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., itâ€™s important to get beyond the binary liberal-versus-conservative label and see these and other recent cases in their full context. We have to ask what on earth the Fisher case was even doing on the courtâ€™s docket, three years after the justices had sent it back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (which had ruled for Texas) with instructions to look again and see whether the university had done enough to justify its modest use of race.Once the conservative appeals court found for a second time that the Texas plan passed muster, that would have been the end of it for any mildly liberal Supreme Court. But the conservative justices â€” including, at the time, Justice Scalia â€” wanted to teach a lesson not only to the Fifth Circuit but also, it appears in retrospect, to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whom they deemed too squishy for having failed in the previous decision to slam the door completely on race-conscious admissions.Surprise: This time, Justice Kennedy explained exactly why, in his view, the status quo on affirmative action should remain the law. Granted, he had never before embraced the precedents he cited. But the strategic miscalculation by justices impatient to undo those precedents hardly turns the Fisher outcome into the incarnation of liberalism.Similarly, the abortion case has to be seen in context. The Fifth Circuit had upheld onerous new restrictions on abortion clinics in Texas, taking the startling position that when a state says it is regulating abortion for the purpose of protecting womenâ€™s health, no court should inquire into whether the regulation actually serves that goal. As Justice Stephen G. Breyerâ€™s majority opinion last week made clear, that stance of complete judicial deference flies in the face of the Supreme Courtâ€™s rejection 24 years ago of â€œunnecessary health regulationsâ€ that impose a substantial obstacle to abortion access without conveying a health-related benefit.Of the justices in last weekâ€™s majority, only Justice Kennedy was in the majority when the court decided the earlier case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which announced the â€œundue burdenâ€ standard that Justice Breyerâ€™s opinion applied to the Texas law. What we learn from the fact that Justice Kennedy joined Justice Breyerâ€™s opinion is that he still means now what he said back then â€” not that he has suddenly turned into a liberal. Whatâ€™s surprising is not Justice Kennedyâ€™s vote, but that the three justices who dissented â€” Chief Justice Roberts along with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. â€” were willing to close their eyes to the weight of precedent and evidence. (These three, along with Justice Scalia, would have permitted the regulations to take effect without Supreme Court review, dissenting in June of last year when the court voted 5 to 4 to grant a stay of the Fifth Circuitâ€™s ruling to permit the clinics to remain open while they appealed.)Itâ€™s worth remembering that todayâ€™s conservative justices are a good deal more conservative than the liberal justices are liberal. Judicial liberals have been playing defense for decades, while judicial conservatives have grown ever bolder in re-purposing existing doctrine to the service of their agenda. In the Roberts court, the First Amendment is a prime example. Only Justice Scaliaâ€™s death and the resultant 4-to-4 tie in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association kept the court from invoking the First Amendment to cut the financial legs out from under public employee unions. The claim by the anti-union forces was that the First Amendment shielded them from having to pay that portion of union dues that support the unionâ€™s collective bargaining activities â€” in other words, that they had a constitutional right to free-ride on the money and work of others.As with the Fisher case, we have to ask why this case was on the courtâ€™s calendar. Supreme Court precedent was clear that the required dues payments were constitutional, and no lower court had ruled to the contrary. The answer is that the litigation that became the Friedrichs case was served up in response to the open invitation that Justice Alito had issued in two earlier labor cases, cases that had fallen short of providing the vehicle he needed to reach the First Amendment issue. A 5-to-4 decision against the unions appeared inevitable when the case was argued on Jan. 11, barely a month before Justice Scaliaâ€™s unexpected death. It was the result of fate rather than a turn to the left that the unions emerged from the term unscathed.Itâ€™s possible, of course, to massage the Roberts courtâ€™s recent actions sufficiently to fit a liberal frame â€” although donâ€™t tell that to the millions of undocumented immigrants who had pinned their hopes on the Obama administrationâ€™s deferred-deportation program or to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose dissenting opinion in Utah v. Strieff, a Fourth Amendment search case, was a powerful warning of what happens when the police are free to stop people in the hope that something might turn up. The same-sex marriage ruling, Obergefell v. Hodges, just passed its first anniversary. That 5-to-4 decision was a liberal ruling, wasnâ€™t it? Well, yes, although by the time the Supreme Court weighed in, lower courts, as well as voters, were embracing marriage equality at a rapid clip; the justices overturned the single federal appeals court to have rejected the marriage claim. The answer to the question Chief Justice Roberts posed in his dissenting opinion, â€œJust who do we think we are?â€ might have been: â€œWeâ€™re the ones who closed the barn door after the horses were gone.â€Does it matter whether people are right or wrong in attaching a liberal label to the Roberts court? Itâ€™s worth trying to understand whatâ€™s driving this conversation. While liberals and conservatives may agree on little else these days, they seem to agree on this â€” but for very different reasons.The rallying cry to the conservative base is: Weâ€™re in a fight to get the Supreme Court back, and in the meantime at least to keep it from tilting further to the left. The motivation on the liberal side is harder to figure. I hope Iâ€™m not unfairly detecting a note of triumphalism: Weâ€™re winning because our ideas are better.If Iâ€™m right, I think thatâ€™s dangerous. While I agree that these particular ideas are better, thatâ€™s not why they have gained a toehold in a court that not too many years ago was being described as the most conservative Supreme Court in modern United States history. Itâ€™s because the other side has gone to such extremes â€” witness the abortion case with its partnership between the Texas Legislature and the Fifth Circuit. To reject a conservative extreme doesnâ€™t make the court liberal. Rather, it puts the court â€” increasingly over the dissent of the chief justice, itâ€™s worth noting â€” in the zone of mainstream reasonableness.",1

"Obama Ruins The Holidays... Christmas Lights To Be Banned To Avoid Offending Muslims If you want a sneak peek of what could happen to our country if Hillary Clinton is president and follows through with her refugee proposal, just look to Sweden. According to recent reports, many towns in Sweden banned the use of Christmas lights on the street to avoid offending the millions of Muslim migrants living in the country. This shows just how extreme the worldwide push to be politically correct has become. A SVT report stated that The Swedish Transport Administration will not allow municipalities to put Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages. For some towns, that means no lights at all for the holiday. The change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the countrys Christian traditions, but according to the Swedish Transport Administration, the decision for the drastic change is security, Speisa reported. Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there, Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator for the agency, told reporters. Of course, the claim that the lights are too heavy is absolutely absurd. Its insulting that they actually expect people to believe that. What do you think? Are you tired of Christians being censored?

"Brussels Looks to Expand Into Middle East and Africa UKIP MP: EU Wants an EmpireBy Joseph Jankowski It also outlinesgradual synchronisation and mutual adaptation between different member states individual defense strategies. The EU wants its own Empire as former Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso made clear when he was in charge,UKIPs defence spokesman Mike Hookem said.This global strategy by the EU is yet another reason why last Thursdays result was a lucky escape for the UK. The Executive Summary of the document reads: It is in the interests of our citizens to invest in the resilience of states and societies to the east stretching into Central Asia, and to the south down to Central Africa. Under the current EU enlargement policy, a credible accession process grounded in strict and fair conditionality is vital to enhance the resilience of countries in the Western Balkans and of Turkey. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), many people wish to build closer relations with the Union: our enduring power of attraction can spur transformation in these countries. The documents speaks of transforming the current EU systemand commits to the deliverance of a global governing body. EU Foreign Policy Cheif Federica Mogherini writes in the Foreword: The latest plan outlines how the EU wants autonomy in defense and security matters. European security and defence efforts should enable the EU to act autonomously while also contributing to and undertaking action in co-operation with NATO, the Brussels document reads. Member States need the technological and industrial means to acquire and sustain those capabilities which underpin their ability to act autonomously. It goes on to read, Gradual synchronisation and mutual adaption of national defence planning cycles and capability development practice can enhance strategic convergence between Member States. When asked if he believedthe document showed Brussels waspositioning itself as a rival to NATO, UKIPsMike Hookem said:Im not sure whether in reality it will be a threat to NATO. Although I am sure it would like to be, because NATO are competent, says Hookem. The fearof a European army was at the core of the Brexit campaignasArmed Forces Minister Penny Mordaunt warned that if Britain were to stay in the EU, it would be forced to join the EUs army. According to reports from Brussels, the Global Strategy document was kept secret as the UK was preparing to hold a referendum on its EU membership out of fears that it could affect the outcome byboosting theLeave campaigns popularity. SeveralEuropean politicians have recently voiced support for the creation of an EU army. RTreports: Meanwhile, EU officials repeatedly voiced the idea of forming the Unions own armed forces. On June 26, the head of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Elmar Brok, said that the EU needs a common military headquarters that could pave the way for a united EU armed force, which would make the blocks policy much more effective and strengthen its role in the world. In 2015, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called for the creation of a united European army, which he said would be aimed at deterring Russia and strengthening the alliance.

As soon as NATO is requested to become part of such an expansion policy, is the perfect time for Canada to exit the Defense organization. Using military power to aggressively promote European power is adoption of American devices. The EU does not need an empire to compete with the American empire. The only way to move forward in todays World is to invite Russia into NATO and ask both Canada and the US to leave! After TTiP Europe will be a colony of the American Empire and will be behaving like a bunch of fascists anyway. All the EU needs to do is to conquer Libya and Tunisia and it will now be the same territory as the 3rd Reich. let us all stop kidding Ourselves, Barroso is not in charge of the EU, so lets get that straight, next the EU is controlled by the USA as it was also created, And it will make no difference to NATO because it is American also, and that Is the real reason that the UK exited, because it is Americas way of trying to create world war three from a European perspective.

"Sadiq Khan is being urged to halt the construction of a skyscraper because it mars a centuries-old view of St Paulâ€™s Cathedral. Conservationists are calling on the London mayor to take action against a 42-storey tower in Stratford, east London, which they say damages the view of Sir Christopher Wrenâ€™s landmark from King Henryâ€™s Mound in Richmond Park.    View of St Paulâ€™s before construction of the tower started. Photograph: Architect's Journal   The charity Friends of Richmond Park has written to Khan urging him to halt the construction of Manhattan Loft Gardens, designed by SOM and described on its website as â€œEuropeâ€™s most ambitious residential towerâ€. It comprises three extensive sky gardens, a 145-bedroom hotel, almost 250 residential units, and retail and restaurant space.    SOMâ€™s proposed 42-storey mixed-use skyscraper by Stratford station, near the Olympic Park in east London. Photograph: Architect's Journal   The charity said current planning rules should have protected the view, which has existed for more than 300 years and draws crowds of visitors to Richmond Park. Under the capitalâ€™s overarching planning document the London Plan, the London view management framework (LVMF) states that any development in the background of St Paulâ€™s should be â€œsubordinate to the cathedral and that the clear sky background profile of the upper part of the dome remainsâ€. However, photographs released by Friends of Richmond Park show that the emerging skyscraper in Stratford is clearly visible behind the cathedral.   Related: A clear strategy on tall buildings can cut developers down to size | Rowan Moore   The charity said on its website: â€œThe new development clearly and substantially compromises the profile of the whole of the dome of St Paulâ€™s and, for almost the entire east side of the building, the clear sky background is obliterated.â€ Its chairman, Ron Crompton, said in a statement: â€œIt is a tragedy that such a wonderful and iconic protected view, between two of Londonâ€™s most historic landmarks and created over 300 years ago, should be destroyed not just for today but for many years to come.â€ Cromptonâ€™s letter to Khan calls for an urgent investigation into how GLA officers allowed the proposal to win planning, in contravention of the LVMF. He has also called for the housing and planning minister Gavin Barwell to ensure that future applications relating to the sight line are referred to English Heritage and the mayor.   Related: Is the only way up for London's skyline?   Historic England, the UKâ€™s statutory adviser on heritage, has also protested against the development and said it was not consulted. Its London planning director, Emily Gee, told the Architectsâ€™ Journal (AJ): â€œIn the wrong places, tall buildings can do serious, irrevocable harm to important views and the special character of London. â€œWe are very concerned that this has happened and see it as a failing of the current approach to the planning for tall buildings.â€ The AJ reports that the planning application for the tower was referred to the GLA in 2010 by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), which was acting as the planning authority in the run-up to the London Olympics. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan Loft Corporation told the Guardian the developer went through a transparent and public process to gain planning permission, adding that that maps of the LVMF protected view indicated that the background area to be protected beyond St Paulâ€™s was 3km (1.86 miles) long whereas its tower was 7km (4.35 miles) beyond. â€œThroughout the planning process we found the GLA and all the other planning bodies to be very supportive for such an aspirational residential project,â€ the spokeswoman said. â€œAs planning approval was achieved [on] 18 July 2011, we were never asked about the LVMF background view impact. â€œHowever, SOM has a long history of working with the St Paulâ€™s view corridors and the more recent London Plan LVMF document. â€œWe would recommend that the King Henry VIIIâ€™s Mound also be illustrated as seen from the naked eye where the distance to St Paulâ€™s Cathedral is 15.5km (and Manhattan Loft Gardens is an additional 7km beyond).â€ A spokesman for Khan said: â€œWe are currently looking into the issues involved with this development.â€",1
"The program, launched after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was ended by new agency Director Leon E. Panetta last month shortly after he learned about it and before it became operational. The investigation is aimed at determining whether CIA or other officials violated laws that require the executive branch to keep Congress fully informed of 'significant' intelligence activities. It opens a new front in the ongoing scrutiny of the agency's counterterrorism efforts under the Bush administration. Members of Congress didn't learn about the program until June 24, when Panetta arranged emergency briefings with the intelligence committees in both chambers. At the time, Panetta told lawmakers that Cheney had instructed the CIA not to share information about the program with Congress. Aides to Cheney have not responded to requests for comment. But former Bush administration officials have disputed characterizations of Cheney's involvement, saying that his comments came early in the program and that he merely encouraged the CIA not to discuss the effort until it was clear that it would go forward. CIA officials struggled for years to overcome legal and logistical obstacles, including who should be selected for the missions, where they would be trained and based, and how they might be extracted if they were successful. After shelving the program several times, agency officials revived the idea in recent years in hopes that the teams could also gather intelligence on the ground in Pakistan that could provide new clues to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. The House probe comes at a time of intense political fighting on Capitol Hill over Bush-era counterterrorism measures. Earlier this year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the CIA of misleading Congress about the brutal interrogation methods it had employed after the Sept. 11 attacks. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the top Republican on the House committee, called the investigation a 'partisan plan' by Democrats to provide political cover for Pelosi. 'They are putting their partisan conclusions ahead of the facts,' Hoekstra said, noting that Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair indicated earlier this week that he agreed there was no need to brief Congress on the program because it never got off the ground. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano noted that Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, had pledged to avoid allowing the investigation to become a 'distraction' to CIA employees, and said the agency would 'work closely with the committee on this review.'

"It was a routine bit of international diplomacy: two presidents speaking for an hour about â€œtopical issues of the agenda of Ukraine-Kyrgyzstan relationsâ€, as the press release on the website of the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, put it on Wednesday.  Poroshenko asked his counterpart about potential support for a forthcoming Ukrainian initiative at the UN to condemn Russian human rights abuses in annexed Crimea.  The only problem is that the Kyrgyz president, Almazbek Atambayev, says he never made the call. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to work out who Poroshenko spent an hour on the phone with. Suspicion is likely to fall on a pair of Russian hoaxers who have made a habit of embarrassing world leaders with fake calls, and whose pranks often seem to align with Russian state interests. Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, better known as Lexus and Vovan, made the headlines last year when they called Sir Elton John pretending to be the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Putin later called the singer to assuage his embarrassment at falling for the hoax. In April, editors at the New York Times held a conference call with a man claiming to be Poroshenko, after the newspaper received a letter complaining about coverage of Ukraine in its pages. It transpired the call was a hoax. Poroshenko has attracted the attention of the pranksters on numerous occasions, but previously he has been impersonated rather than pranked himself. In February, Stolyarov and Kuznetsov reached the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, pretending to be Poroshenko.    Alexei Stolyarov (left) and Vladimir Kuznetsov at a cafe in Moscow, showing video of a prank on Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Photograph: The Guardian   Stolyarov declined to comment when asked by the Guardian whether he was responsible for the fake Kyrgyz call. It is one thing to fool a newspaper or celebrity, and quite another to be able to place hoax calls claiming to be a president calling his counterpart in another country. Such calls are usually set up using elaborate protocol and using special secure lines, prompting many to believe the pranksters must have help from Russiaâ€™s FSB security service.  Stolyarov and Kuznetsov have denied claims they work for or with the FSB. â€œWe work for ourselves, nobody else,â€ Stolyarov told the Guardian in March. The news item about the call was quietly removed from the Ukrainian presidentâ€™s website, and on Thursday the Kyrgyz and Ukrainian foreign ministers spoke by telephone and attempted to smooth over the incident.  A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokeswoman said: â€œBoth we and the Kyrgyz side are looking into this planned provocation. We will work out all the circumstances, including the technical details. Itâ€™s already clear that the goal of this kind of action is to disrupt Ukraineâ€™s important UN initiatives over Crimea.â€",1
"Despite punching his opponent so hard and so often Monday that he killed him in the ring, boxer James Griffin is somehow not the sports current world champion. It would seem that killing a person while boxing would mean the pugilist has reached the absolute top of his profession, but according to federation rules, that isnt the case, said boxing analyst Gary Brito, adding that if the goal of boxing is to punch someone so that he cant get up during a 10-count, punching someone to a point where he is physically incapable of ever getting up again should warrant some sort of championship belt.

"Labor rights activists renewed their call Thursday for wage earners around the country to take to the streets this weekend to protest declining wages and the rising prevalence of dispatch work. Representatives of various labor rights groups, including the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) , made the appeal in a news conference held in front of the Council of Labor Affairs. It marked the third time in the past two weeks that labor rights groups have appealed for like-minded activists to take part in the May 1 protest march to mark Labor Day. Huang Yu-teh, spokesman for a labor alliance against poverty, said the appeals against poverty and dispatch work have won the support of many workers, both blue collar and white collar. 'We believe more than 10,000 people will turn out for the anti-poverty parade this weekend,' Huang said. The demonstrators will march from Liberty Square at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex on Taipei's Zhongshan South Road to the intersection of Zhongshan South Road and Zhongxiao West Road near the Executive Yuan to voice their appeals, Huang said. The protest march will focus on four appeals -- 'fighting poverty and forbidding dispatched work,' 'labor union autonomy, ' 'labor participation in and democratic supervision of ECFA, ' and 'allowing all wage earners to receive monthly pensions,' he added. Dispatched workers refer to those who work for manpower agencies and are 'dispatched' full-time to companies on a contract basis. Some companies prefer this arrangement because of the flexibility it gives them in managing their work forces and because they do not have to pay benefits or severance to the contract workers. ",1
"Josh Frydenberg has defended Australiaâ€™s coal industry as â€œvitally importantâ€ days after a former Great Barrier Reef authority chief called for a ban on new mines. Speaking after a forum on the reef with state and territory ministers in Sydney on Friday, the federal environment minister said other countries would simply â€œfill the voidâ€ if Australia did not export coal. â€œWe have said consistently and publicly that coal is a part of the national and international energy mix and will be so for decades to come,â€ he said. â€œThe coal sector is vitally important in Queensland as it is in other parts of the country, it helps to meet the energy security of millions of people across the world, creating billions of dollars of export income, and employing many people.â€   Related: Australia failing to protect Great Barrier Reef from shipping disasters, say lawyers   The government has until Thursday to hand Unesco a progress report outlining its efforts to save the reef, or risk it being listed as â€œin dangerâ€. The report will need to show that Australia has properly funded and implemented policies to improve water quality by 2050.  If it does not, Unesco and the World Heritage committee will reconsider the listing for the reef at a meeting next year.  Frydenberg said he was confident the governmentâ€™s submission would show enormous progress in improving the reef. But environmental campaigners say the current reporting period has been poor for the reef, with the approval of Australiaâ€™s largest coalmine, the impact of the worst bleaching event in the reefâ€™s history and the Queensland parliamentâ€™s failure to legislate to stop land clearing in catchment areas. The government was also revealed to have put pressure on Unesco to remove negative references to Australia and the reef in a previous report on climate change. Scientists have said current funding levels go nowhere near those required to achieve 2050 targets, and a report card last month gave the reef a D for its overall health for the fifth year in a row. This week Graeme Kelleher, the Great Barrier Reef marine park authorityâ€™s chief for 16 years, said the only real way to save the reef was to stop approving new coalmines. â€œAustralia cannot have a healthy Great Barrier Reef and a continuing coal industry,â€ he said. Frydenberg responded by defending coal, saying Australiaâ€™s industry was cleaner than those overseas. Kelleher told Guardian Australia on Friday that Frydenbergâ€™s comments were typical of the short-sighted approach of the federal and Queensland governments.  He said their efforts continued to focus on â€œshort-term local issuesâ€ that were easy to fix, including the reduction of pollutants from the mainland. â€œThey are not trivial,â€ he said. â€œBut the major threat to the Great Barrier Reef and to all the coral reefs of the world comes from climate change, from the burning of fossil fuels.â€ â€œThey are looking at the very short term, because even with a global increase in temperature of two degrees the reef will be severely damaged.â€   Related: The Great Barrier Reef: a catastrophe laid bare   The approval of Adaniâ€™s Carmichael mine would have no adverse impact on Australiaâ€™s efforts to avoid the â€œin dangerâ€ listing, he said. Adani and state and federal authorities had gone to significant lengths to ensure the mine met strict environmental standards. Frydenberg and Queenslandâ€™s environment minister, Steven Miles, said positive steps had been made towards fulfilling the Reef 2050 plan.  That included a ban on the disposal of dredge material, stricter cane farming and grazing measures and boosting funding to control crown-of-thorns starfish. The government announced $45m to restore catchment zones in Burdekin, Fitzroy and Cape York, aimed at preventing sediment run-off. Kelleher welcomed that funding, saying it would be of significant benefit to the reef.  â€œThat $45m is a really good investment and it will reduce stress on the Great Barrier Reef, without any doubt.â€  Miles said the â€œgreat shameâ€ of the submission would be the failure to legislate to stop land clearing in reef catchment areas. That legislation was blocked by the LNP opposition in Queensland. â€œWe have to explain to the global community that we failed to implement one of the very important commitments, and that was to reduce land clearing in Queensland,â€ Miles said. Shani Tager, reef campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said on Friday the plan to save the reef would only be credible if it included genuine measures to tackle climate change.  Tager said she was doubtful that the government could achieve its 2050 goals, given the current track record, and highlighted the expansion of the Abbot Point coal terminal as a particular threat to the reef. â€œWe think to have a credible plan to prom the reef you have to have a plan to tackle climate change and we think this starts with banning coal mining,â€ she said. One nation leader Pauline Hanson travelled to the reef on Friday with colleagues Malcolm Roberts and Brian Burston in an effort to prove it is healthy. They are travelling to the south of the reef, not the north, which has recently experienced the worst bleaching event recorded in its history. ",1
"PHILADELPHIA â€” The Federal Reserve, mindful of unexpectedly weak job growth last month, has abandoned hope of raising interest rates at its next meeting in June, but Fed officials say they are still thinking seriously about raising rates in July or September.Janet L. Yellen, the Fedâ€™s chairwoman, said a few weeks ago that she expected the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate â€œin the coming months,â€ but she omitted those words from a Monday speech, indicating the reported weakness of job creation in May has caused the Fed to rethink its plans.Still, Ms. Yellen delivered a generally upbeat assessment of economic conditions. While describing the May jobs report as â€œconcerning,â€ she also emphasized that it was just one piece of data and that other economic indicators, including wage growth, paint a considerably brighter picture.â€œI see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones,â€ she told the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.Investors have all but written off the chances the Fed will increase rates at its next meeting on June 14 and 15, and Ms. Yellen did not try to change their minds. Her speech was the last public appearance by a Fed official before the meeting.But she added that she still expected economic growth â€” and she still expected rate increases.â€œIf incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate,â€ she said.Some Fed officials have delivered a similar message since the May report.Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has sounded relatively confident in recent months, indicating that the economy was ready for a rate increase. In Stockholm on Saturday, she said that the May jobs report, while disappointing, had not changed her overall economic assessment.Others have emphasized that there is no reason to rush, suggesting that the Fed should wait for stronger data before moving to raise rates.â€œThere would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence,â€ Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech on Friday. In her judgment, Ms. Brainard said, the risks of moving too soon significantly exceeded the dangers of waiting a little too long.Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor who shares Ms. Brainardâ€™s caution, said on Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg that he was still looking for â€œan affirmative reason to move.â€The government estimated last week that the economy added 38,000 jobs in May, well below market expectations and the pace of hiring so far this year.The Fed entered the year predicting quarterly rate increases, only to back away from a first increase in March when the economy showed unexpected signs of weakness. Fed officials in recent weeks insisted they were thinking about raising rates in June. Now it seems that too has passed.Ms. Yellen did not offer a new plan, and that was intentional.â€œI know market participants really want to know exactly whatâ€™s going to happen,â€ she said at one point. â€œThere is, as I said about 18 times, no preset plan.â€She devoted much of her speech to the economic uncertainties confronting the Fed. Among them, she numbered the inconsistency of recent economic data and Britainâ€™s coming referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. She said a breakup would be economically disruptive.â€œThe uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve,â€ she said.But reasons for optimism were also on display Monday.After her speech, Ms. Yellen met with workers at a job-training program in West Philadelphia. During her first year as Fed chairwoman, round tables with workers in Chicago and Chelsea, Mass., brought together many attendees who were struggling to find jobs. The tone of Mondayâ€™s round table was notably more upbeat â€” the seven people who met with Ms. Yellen all had jobs or, if they were in training programs, were optimistic about finding steady work.Mark Gay spent nearly two years looking for full-time work before he found a job with a landscaping business run by the University City District, the nonprofit group that hosted the meeting. Asked whether life was improving for people in his West Philadelphia neighborhood, he paused before answering.â€œI would have to agree,â€ he said. â€œYes, a lot of people in my community have gained employment since 2012.â€Sarah Davis, director of development for University City District, says its jobs-training program has about 110 graduates a year. She said the percentage of those finding jobs has climbed steadily over the last five years to about 95 percent, and demand from potential employers now exceeds the supply of workers the program can offer. â€œWeâ€™re getting daily calls from potential employer partners,â€ Ms. Davis said.Yet Ms. Yellen noted in her speech that unemployment remained widespread among minorities and lesser-educated people. There were also signs the labor market is no longer healing as quickly. The economy has added 125,000 jobs per month this year, compared with a monthly average of 229,000 last year.The Fedâ€™s in-house labor market conditions index, devised to summarize a wide range of labor market data, has declined each month since the Fed raised interest rates in December.â€œThe Fedâ€™s current course is driven not by the state of the economy, but by a desire to get interest rates and its balance sheet back to what is considered normal,â€ Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wrote in a Bloomberg opinion piece last week criticizing the Fedâ€™s desire to raise rates.Ms. Yellen responded indirectly to that critique during a question-and-answer session after her speech on Monday. She said the Fed was focused on its mandates of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation. Raising rates was not an end but a means, she said.She noted that the economy should benefit from a virtuous loop of increased employment and rising incomes. â€œIf the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth should pick up and support further gains in income,â€ Ms. Yellen said.On the other hand, she noted, â€œthe less favorable possibilityâ€ was that a slowdown in corporate investment had translated into a slowdown in job growth. How long will it take to tell the difference? On Monday, Ms. Yellen wasnâ€™t offering any predictions. â€œMy colleagues and I will be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward,â€ she said.",1

"I first happened upon it one morning, while flipping through the Time Life Foods of the World book â€˜â€˜Classic French Cookingâ€™â€™: a photograph of an alabaster edible dome, mosaicked in carrots and turnips, with molding of green beans and English peas, its base edged by slabs of bacon and sausage and glazed tiny onions, looking for all the world like a frosted vegetable cake. It was called a chartreuse. A few days after gazing on its strange countenance, for a different reason entirely, I found myself reading about La Grande Chartreuse â€” not a food but a monastery built on a white Alpine ridge, reached by a single road winding through a great massif into medieval clouds, in Roy Andries de Grootâ€™s 1973 culinary travelogue, â€˜â€˜Auberge of the Flowering Hearth.â€™â€™ And about the Carthusians, an old silent order of vegetarians who spend their days alone in cells. I became transfixed by the dish and the monks and resolved to find out what connected the two.As defined by Larousse Gastronomique, chartreuse is â€˜â€˜a preparation of vegetables (particularly braised cabbage) and meat or game, molded into a dome and formed of layers of alternating colors.â€™â€™ This dish, largely forgotten today, was once considered the pinnacle of gastronomic sophistication. Antonin Careme, culinary demigod of 19th-century France, christened it the Queen of All Entrees.The common story for the connection between Carthusians and a vegetable construction concealing meat is that the name is literal: that the obedient monks were not so obedient â€” they hid meat inside cabbage and carrot to hide transgression. But neither my mystically riveted soul nor religious history support it. As Ken Albala, director of food studies at University of the Pacific, wrote me, for most of Christian history, vegetarianism was dangerously close to heresy. Since Augustine, a central assertion of the church was that the earth was made for our use and animals for our table. More likely is that the dignified monks ate their bread and roots and wine, as they vowed â€” and then some late-18th-century chef made an edible vegetable sculpture with meat at its center and called it chartreuse, a wink at the leguminous monks.The one certainty is that chartreuse was as much symbol as substance, revealing what its contemporaries found beautiful. In the Larousse definition â€” â€˜â€˜molded into a dome,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜layers of alternating colorsâ€™â€™ â€” you get a hint of why chartreuse has disappeared from our tables. Recipes from the same era provide the rest of the reason. One, by Careme, directs the cook to form asparagus into a rose; another, to carve turnips into tiny pears; another, to create a checkerboard of carrots and turnips. In the 19th century (and the centuries before it), to get at the nature of ingredients, you would refine them â€” by peeling them, boiling them, braising them, sieving them smooth â€” as â€˜â€˜silver from ore,â€™â€™ in the words of the culinary historian Rachel Laudan. Food was made worthy of human attention by acquisition of an artificial aspect.Of course, today itâ€™s the opposite: Our ageâ€™s cultured eaters want ingredients as nature made them. We want to see the spirit of the cabbage in the cabbage, the mushroom in the mushroom.What in the chartreuse merits reviving? We no longer admire the highly manipulated beauty of 200 years ago. But we do like when dishes, particularly ones for special days, give a flattering reflection of nature â€” and a chartreuse can serve as the perfect display case for any vision of the natural world, including our own.To the extent that chartreuse is a rather perfect artifact of its age, an updated one canâ€™t be a re-enactment. Taking that into consideration, I have done something food historians and archivists would consider quite improper: I have done away with a geometry that is not considered beautiful in food now. Iâ€™ve dispatched the careful placement of peas; Iâ€™ve removed the partridges. Now it is not just regal but delicious, tasting earthy and green and deep â€” a homage to the monks in their high woods. Regardless, no one survives to object: Careme is long gone, and in the forests around the Grande Chartreuse, the monks are silent.

"Russ Bakke, 37, unsuccessfully attempted to pull an unnamed female across a nightclub dance floor Saturday with a pantomimed lasso motion. 'After making eye contact with the young lady and giving her a seductive smile, I attempted to rope her in with my invisible lasso of love,' Bakke said. 'But for some reason, when I threw the lasso toward her and mimicked a pulling motion, she was not drawn my way.' Subsequent attempts to capture the woman with a pantomimed fishing rod and butterfly net also met with failure. ",0
"â€œRevolution â€¦ is sacrifice,â€ echoed the trembling voice of an elderly Fidel Castro around the streets of Old Havana at dawn on Saturday, as Cuban state radio began replaying his speeches, the day after his death. Dani, 37, who takes tourists around the cobbled streets on his bicitaxi, had woken to be told the momentous news by a neighbour. â€œI didnâ€™t believe it,â€ he said. Like many Cubans of his generation he had begun to assume that Castro would be around for ever. El Comandanteâ€™s 80th birthday, a decade ago, had been celebrated with posters declaring â€œ80 more yearsâ€. Outside the art deco Bacardi building, one of many private businesses expropriated in the 1960s by a young, triumphant Castro, Mario Astoria, a security guard, was sitting on his own. â€œI feel this in my heart,â€ he said. â€œWhen Fidel came to power this country was a pebble in the ocean. Now everyone knows about us.â€ The previous evening, at Havanaâ€™s current hippest spot, the cavernous art gallery and nightclub Fabrica de Arte, there was a different atmosphere. At midnight, it began closing its bars, without explanation. The rumour spread that the reason was a forthcoming momentous announcement. When the news finally came, it drifted out slowly. Castro was always suspicious of the internet, and Cuban mobile phones are still not able to connect to it. Locals were depending on foreign tourists with connectivity to tell them their â€œhistoric leaderâ€ had died.    A Cuban flag at half-mast in Havana. Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images   Liset, 26, a dancer, gasped with shock when she heard. Like many Cuban artists she had met Fidel. â€œI was once besotted with him,â€ she said. But she confessed to being more intrigued than sad to hear of his death. â€œI began to feel that what he was saying, and what we were living, were two different things,â€ she said. Out on Havanaâ€™s dimly lit streets people began to make their way home. Many seemed reluctant to talk about the man whose mortality was once such a sensitive subject that foreign ministry officials cut short conversations with diplomats and journalists that dared mention it. By morning, close to Castroâ€™s relatively modest bungalow home in the east of the country, there was no sign of the major state security operation planned had he died when still in power. One of Castroâ€™s mantras was that â€œrevolutionaries never retireâ€. Had a serious intestinal ailment not almost killed him in 2006, forcing him to step down, few imagine that the worldâ€™s longest-serving non-royal head of state would have willingly handed control of the nation to anyone, even his younger brother. But in his twilight years Castro appeared to enjoy stepping back from the onerous duties of the presidency, if not the limelight. He abandoned his trademark khaki uniform, instead opting for a more comfortable tracksuit, in which he would occasionally be photographed meeting visiting dignitaries. â€œHe had his good days and his bad days,â€ said one Havana-based European diplomat. On those â€œgood daysâ€ he would make his views clear, writing an often-rambling newspaper column, which was dutifully read out in its entirety on the nightly news. He avoided praising â€“ or criticising â€“ his brother RaÃºlâ€™s unravelling of some of the more pedantic rules which he had imposed, such as a prohibition of Cubans staying in tourist hotels, or having mobile phones in their own names.   Today a symbol of terror dies, but not terror itself. That we still have to burry along with totalitarianismWe will with #Cubadecide.org pic.twitter.com/pFdI03vb8Oâ€” Rosa MarÃ­a PayÃ¡ A. (@RosaMariaPaya) November 26, 2016  As relations between Cuba and the United States improved, Castro came as close as he had to directly criticising his brother, saying the Cuban president had the right to make his own decisions, but â€œI donâ€™t trust the policy of the United Statesâ€. Castro died at 10.29pm on Friday, but the Cuban public were not informed until a midnight broadcast by President Castro. In a southern suburb of the city, the RodrÃ­guez family watched in a stunned silence that continued long after the broadcast had ended. â€œEl Caballo is dead,â€ said Leo, finally, referring to Castro by his nickname of â€œthe Horseâ€, as his voice cracked with emotion. The airport worker is a devoted Fidelista who still drapes a revolutionary flag from his apartment window on national day. He met his wife Clarita at the Union of Young Communists. They credit the government for subsidised housing, free university education and free healthcare, which is of particular importance to their daughter, who needs to see a doctor every two weeks for treatment of a chronic condition. Given such benefits, they expect huge crowds to gather at the capitalâ€™s Plaza de la RevoluciÃ³n to show their respect. â€œThe plaza will be overflowing,â€ Clarita predicted. Their neighbour was also shocked. Like many of her generation, 36-year-old Elena hates the restrictions imposed on free speech in Cuba and has long wished that the â€œdictatorshipâ€ would collapse. But she was in tears when she heard the news. â€œOf course Iâ€™m crying,â€ she said. â€œWe Cubans are Fidelista even if we are not communist.â€ Elsewhere in the city, residents expressed their sense of loss.  â€œIâ€™m speechless. Many Cubans are dismayed,â€ said Mercedes Copa, 59. â€œFidelâ€™s death opens a period of uncertainty. Perhaps today is the start of a new stage in Cuban history,â€ said Irma Guzman, her neighbour. Castroâ€™s death opens up many uncertainties in a country that has long become used to an exceptionally slow pace of change. The crisis in Venezuela, which for over a decade has sent cheap oil to Cuba, is being acutely felt. Power cuts and gasoline shortages are once again commonplace.  In his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has pledged to reverse President Obamaâ€™s opening up to Cuba, which has included the restoration of diplomatic ties and easing of travel restrictions. RaÃºl Castro has himself said he will stand down from the presidency in 2018. Cuba now begins nine days of national mourning. Castroâ€™s ashes will be taken to his family home in BirÃ¡n, in the far west of the island, retracing the path of his 1959 revolution.  â€œCuba wonâ€™t be the same without him,â€ said Mario Astoria, as the sun rose over Old Havana.

"WHEN I travel, I try to remember a quotation often attributed to William Butler Yeats that there are no strangers, only friends you have not yet met.Iâ€™m a retinal surgeon at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. When I travel in that capacity, Iâ€™m either speaking at a meeting or going someplace to help train other surgeons. I enjoy every place I go. Iâ€™m not needy when I travel. I donâ€™t get jet-lagged. I try to just take things in stride.But no doctor wants to hear, â€œIs there a doctor on board?â€I was on my way to Amsterdam as part of an international studies course. We were about four hours out of Newark, somewhere over the Atlantic. I heard a request for a doctor and it seemed I was the only physician on board. The crew took me to see a fellow passenger, an older Greek woman on oxygen who was short of breath. She recently had surgery and was at risk for deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism.This was a night flight. The lights were dimmed in the cabin and most passengers were sleeping. The womanâ€™s husband was snoring next to her. The emergency kit had a defibrillator, blood pressure cuff, some Band-Aids, a syringe, a stethoscope and possibly some antihistamines. There was little I would be able to do if something happened, but I continually checked her blood pressure and pulse. It was not a good situation, but the woman was stable.We continued on to Amsterdam, and this lovely woman patted my hand the entire time I stayed with her. When we landed, she was taken off the plane by emergency personnel. The crew gave me a bottle of red wine as a thank-you. I never even had a glass â€” the bottle was confiscated by customs.I really like order. I also like civility.I was in China years ago doing lectures and surgeries. I was at the airport in Xiâ€™an and found out my flight was canceled, and I had to wait in a long, hideous line to rebook. I finally got to the front of the line and two young men dressed in black pants, carrying black briefcases, wearing black glasses and sporting some fake Rolexes cut in front of me. Everyone behind me was upset.I know a reasonable amount of Mandarin, but I canâ€™t read or write it, so Iâ€™m considered illiterate. One thing you donâ€™t get taught when you learn a language is how to swear and argue. But I was absolutely furious at these two men, so I asked them in Mandarin, â€œWhat do you think you are doing?â€ They replied, â€œWhat do you think you are doing?â€ I again said, â€œWhat do you think you are doing?â€ They replied with the same phrase. So I changed tactics and asked, â€œWho do you think you are?â€ They replied, â€œWho do you think you are?â€ This form of arguing is fine for 5-year-olds, but it doesnâ€™t work very well when youâ€™re an adult.But for some reason they backed off, and as they walked away they hurled an insult at me, saying I must be from Taiwan and I obviously didnâ€™t understand how things were done.I was really excited that in a foreign country, I somehow managed to put two rude young men in their place. But I was even more excited that my accent wasnâ€™t as bad as I thought it was. These guys actually thought I was Taiwanese. Iâ€™m a Buckeye, born in Columbus, Ohio.",1
"United Nations Review Claims Monsantos Glyphosate Not CarcinogenicBy Derrick Broze Experts with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have released a statement claiming that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans exposed to it through food. The World Health Organization (WHO) co-signed the statement with the FAO. The organizations also found that glyphosate is not likely to be genotoxic, destructive to cells genetic material, in humans. The groups met last week and published their conclusions on Monday. In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet, the committee wrote. Interestingly enough, in March 2015 the WHOs own International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published a report which seems to contradict the new findings. The IARC found that glyphosate probably contributes to non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans and classified it as a Group 2A carcinogen. Aaron Blair, a scientist emeritus at the National Cancer Institute and lead author of the study, told Reuters, There was sufficient evidence in animals, limited evidence in humans and strong supporting evidence showing DNA mutations and damaged chromosomes. The IARC report was published in The Lancet Oncology detailing evaluations of organophosphate pesticides and herbicides. The report concluded that there was limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The evidence for this conclusion was pulled from studies of exposure to the chemical in the US, Canada and Sweden published since 2001. The researchers found convincing evidence that glyphosate can also cause cancer in laboratory animals. The report points out that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) had originally classified glyphosate as possibly carcinogenic to humans in 1985. The IARC Working Group evaluated the original EPA findings and more recent reports before concluding there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Glyphosate is not only the most widely-used herbicide, it is a key ingredient in biotech giant Monsantos popular Roundup products. Glyphosate is only one of Monsantos products that have been recently connected to cancer, however. In June 2015 the IARC also found that the weed killer 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, known as 2,4-D, possibly causes cancer in humans. Shortly after the IARC review, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent agency funded by the European Union, shot back with their own study, claiming that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. If you are keeping score, thats the FAO, WHO, EFSA, and UN stating that glyphosate does not pose a risk of cancer to humans, and the WHOs IARC stating that it could be linked to cancer. However, in the new statement the FAO and WHO deny that the conclusions reached by the IARC are contradictory to their findings. According the WHO, the assessments are different, yet complementary. IARC reviews published studies to identify potential cancer hazards, the WHO said. It does not estimate the level of risk to the population associated with exposure to the hazard. The FAO/WHO statements says the committee looked at studies to assess the health risk to consumers from dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food. Despite the findings by the WHO and FAO, glyphosate has been linked to other health problems. In 2014 Anti-Media reported on a study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health which claims to have found a link between glyphosate and the fatal Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown origin (CKDu), which largely affects rice farmers in Sri Lanka and other nations. In response Sri Lanka has banned glyphosate and Brazil is considering doing the same. Sri Lankas Minister of Special Projects S.M. Chandrasena stated that President Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a directive to ban glyphosate sales in the country. An investigation carried out by medical specialists and scientists have revealed that kidney disease was mainly caused by glyphosate. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has ordered the immediate removal of glyphosate from the local market soon after he was told of the contents of the report. With the USDAs 2014 decision to approve a new batch of genetically modified corn and soybean seeds designed to be resistant to glyphosate, we should expect to see an increase in herbicide use overall, and with it, possibly disastrous health effects. In fact, the approval by the USDA now partners DOW Chemical and Monsanto together, a move which will only further entrench the control that corporate entities have over governments. As the corporate and state power become one machine it will be harder for free minds to trust the establishments science and rhetoric. We must remain vigilant, think critically, and question everything. If we learn anything from the battle over pesticide science and safety it should be a reminder not to be dependent on the factory farming-industrial complex and mainstream systems of food production. If we choose to grow our own food, support backyard, front yard, and community gardens we can reduce the need for harmful pesticides and increase our independence.

From the same lying sacks of dung that brought us global warming, we now have the miraculous news that round-up is safe to drink. One scientific fraud after another. Will the wonders never cease? It would be so hilarious if somebody dumped a barrel of roundup into the rooftop reservoir at the United Nations. We may have to just hang the elite once and for all. To preserve life. Can you buy piano wire in a bulk group purchase? It is reusable. Ammo is running way too high nowadays unless you find somebody who can insert the bullets manually. What shocker. As usual the case is closed with no public debate of the facts. What a f%cked up world we live in. but theres also a downside. Keep thinking positive like this. Or else you will end up like me. Natural orange juice is NOT good for you ! I knew televitz was right! I dont know why I ever doubted her, that glass sage of static wisdom! bs, those making this claim on behalf of the UN have made large deposits into some offshore accounts! aka BRIBES! I believe that the rest of the world has already reached the conclusion the EU, NATO and the UNITED NATIONS are all creations of the UNITED STATES, and therefore becomes the means through which they can inflict death and destruction and trade sanctions, and also poison by using BIO HAZARD MATERIALS of GMOs NAMELY MONSANTO, what the rest of EUROPE needs to do is what RUSSIA and HUNGARY have done, and that is to strip all the GMO toxic poisons from their land and start with fresh reliable seeding, and ban all GMO products, because it is murder by the USA WITH INTENT UPON the rest of the world, all of us should remember what MONSANTO DID TO VIETNAM with AGENT ORANGE and AGENT HADES, that poisoned the land where women today are having babies so badly deformed that they look like crocodiles and octopus. THE USA CANNOT AND WILL NOT LEAVE THE WORLD IN PEACE. Ten years ago I would have laughed in your face. But now its as clear as day. Thats if we could get any sun thru those chemtrail clouds. My country has harmed our country and others. And I am so ashamed. You are right Arlene. United Nazis; nuff said. The UN anything department is nothing more than an extension of the corporate entities that control its funding, and is therefore unreliable as a source of credible information. They should all be forced to eat the gmo scat at their round (square) tables. And you think we believe you? Monsanto Delenda Est! Monsanto competitors make more $$ from this weedkiller than Monsanto, as the patents have expired. If scientists want to help, they should make a red or purple chlorophyll, to intercept more solar energy! Use retinal or rhodopsin? We now live with a yellow-green sun and a blue sky. The least amount of solar radiation is taken up by green chlorophyll. Once plants grow quickly, weeds can be enjoyed too? Meat will only be eaten by Vultures and Crows? The Corporations are corrupting the UN. Whatever Monsanto has to replace Glphosate will be much worse! It does NOT matter what the UN decides. Here in America we are under the US Constitution, not a foreign entity, foreign government, etc; and those that support it and try to enforce it are just openly declaring their Treason and willingness to use *Terrorism against the American people. President Andrew Johnson: Outside of the Constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens, and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us. This broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects. So what does the US Constitution have to do with this? What is a constitution? It is the form of government, delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in which certain first principles of fundamental laws are established. Van Horne v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 304. Constitutional provisions and amendments to the Constitution relate to the fundamental law and certain fixed principles upon which governments are founded. Constitutions are commonly called the organic law of a State. State ex rel. Halliburton v. Roach, 230 Mo. 408, 130 S. W. 689. A constitution is designated as a supreme enactment, a fundamental act of legislation by the people of the state. A constitution is legislation direct from the people acting in their sovereign capacity, while a statute is legislation from their representatives, subject to limitations prescribed by the superior authority. The basic purpose of a written constitution has a two-fold aspect, first securing [not granting] to the people of certain unchangeable rights and remedies, and second, the curtailment of unrestricted governmental activity within certain defined spheres. Du Pont v. Du Pont, 85 A 724. The constitution of a state is stable and permanent, not to be worked upon the temper of the times, not to rise and fall with the tide of events. Notwithstanding the competition of opposing interests, and the violence of contending parties, it remains firm and immoveable, as a mountain amidst the strife and storms, or a rock in the ocean amidst the raging of the waves. Vanhorne v. Dorrance, supra. Cooley, The General Principles of Constitutional Law, 3rd. ed. (1898), pp. 386-387. (Little Brown Co.).: In the construction of these instruments the following rules are actually observed: *28 C.F.R. Section 0.85 Terrorism is defined as the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives. Not anymore Cal, not any more. Obama and Congress flushed our constitution down the toilet. Question is, can we do anything about it? Actually they did exactly what one would expect of a government with no oversight by its bosses. Question is, can we do anything about it? Yes, there is a lot we can do about it. First thing is to read the US Constitution, a short document so that YOU will understand what duties they actually have delegated to them, and which branch is authorized to use what powers as a tool of the position they occupy. What the contract that those that serve within our governments are under actually allows them to do, requires them to do, and forbids them to do In it you will also find YOUR duties assigned to you and to every single American as our part of our government. then you will understand the important piece that is missing and why we are where we are. Not a difficult thing, but your country NEEDS you, and all who have not, to do just that thing. There are good reasons why they took the teaching of it out of schools, why they discourage the reading of it, why they call our Constitutional Republic a Democracy. Then you need to read your state Constitution, most likely quite a bit longer document, so that you will understand what those who serve within your immediate government those assigned with the duties inside our country, inside your state, are allowed to do, are required to do, and what is forbidden to them, but is YOUR duty to do. If you can, it would also be nice to start understanding your local government counties, cities, etc so that you can also understand IF they have overstepped their boundaries placed upon them. that is why all of this is in writing, so that WE know what those that serve in the different, and in the different levels of our government are allowed to do, what they are required to do, and what they are forbidden to do. Can you name at least three powers, duties retained by the people, so forbidden to those that serve within our governments at any level? That knowledge is a huge start on gaining our country back, Is it to much to ask that you read a bit? Honey, I have been reading a lot longer than you have lived on this earth. So dont get cocky with me. Sigh, the benevolent U.N. The Bolshevik run swine violated their own protocol when they rescued Haiti with cholera carrying blue hats, killed thousands then, when called to task, whined they have immunity. I wonder how many billion that cost in bribes? The UN, the government run by and for the NWO. I heart these comments. ",0
"Terrible father Peter Nesmith is the absolute coolest, neighborhood children reported Monday. Nesmith, his wife, and his son Kevin. 'Tommy's dad is so awesome,' said David York, 9, a friend of Nesmith's 7-year-old son Thomas. 'He's not like the other dads who yell at you all the time. Everyone brings their fireworks to blow them off in his backyard. If we run out of matches, he lets us use his cigarette to light them off.' Added York: 'He's the only dad that treats us like adults and not like little babies who can't be trusted with an electric sander.' Nesmith, who married Karen Reynolds in 1990, is the father of three children besides Thomas: Evan, 10; Kevin, 13; and Julia, 15. Soon after moving into the quiet North Portland neighborhood, Nesmith cemented his cool-dad reputation by buying a 1974 Camaro, the costly upkeep of which forced the Nesmith family to cancel its dental insurance earlier this year. 'Before the Super Bowl, Mr. Nesmith let me ride in his Camaro to go to the gas station and help him carry bags of ice,' York said. 'Mrs. Nesmith doesn't want us riding in it, because it has a gas leak, but Mr. Nesmith said if he listened to Mrs. Nesmith, he wouldn't even have the awesome car in the first place.' 'When Mrs. Nesmith went to visit her sister last summer, Tommy got to eat Burger King every single night for the whole two weeks,' York said. 'He got to order whatever he wanted. He even got to ride his bike all the way over to Cortland Avenue to pick it up one night.' Neighborhood parents are less complimentary. Several have complained about the beer parties that Nesmith allows his eldest son Kevin to host in his basement. 'Boys are gonna drink,' Nesmith said when asked about the keg parties. 'At least I know they're safe if they're right there in the basement.' Neighbors have said they suspect that Nesmith purchases alcohol for the boys. 'I don't buy Kevin and his friends beer, but I do usually have a tapped keg set up in the basement fridge,' Nesmith said. 'I don't see what people get so worked up about. If the kids get sick, they can spend the night here. I'm the one who has to deal with a bunch of hungover 13-year-olds.' Added Nesmith: 'It's not like it's on a school night, usually.' Kevin's friend Tony Shadid said his parents are among those who complain about Nesmith. 'Mom's always yelling at us to do better in school so we don't turn out like Kevin's dad,' Shadid said. 'I don't know why. He doesn't look so bad to me. He's got a super-huge stereo and his own room in the basement with posters on the wall and a leather couch.' According to his children, Nesmith leaves the role of disciplinarian to his wife. 'Dad always says he didn't do good in school and he turned out fine,' Kevin said. 'He said he never really did homework and only went to class half the time. That's because it's way more important to get out in the world and get life experience. Dad mostly talks about all the drinking he did back then, but I think he also worked part-time at a machine shop or something.' Nesmith said he believes it's important to prepare his children for the 'real world.' In accordance with that belief, he gave his daughter Julia a condom Saturday before her date with a boy who was too scared to hold her hand. That same night, he let Evan watch the sexually explicit Monster's Ball while Kevin browsed his father's pornography stash in the garage. 'Kids need to learn about sex sometime,' Nesmith said. 'Otherwise, they'll just learn a bunch of fucked-up information about it on the street.' 'Don't worry,' he added. 'I keep the real rough stuff hidden.' Neighbor and father of two Jerry Helms said he thinks Nesmith is an 'all-right guy,' but said he was mystified by the adoration the neighborhood children heap on the terrible father. 'Whenever my son Jeff comes back from playing with Tommy, he's always saying, 'Mr. Nesmith let us do this, Mr. Nesmith let us do that,'' Helms said. 'He loves the guy, but sometimes I wonder. I always think of the time Tommy cut himself on a rusty nail and Pete sent him back to playing without doing anything about it.' Helms said he asked Nesmith if he was worried about Tommy getting an infection or even lockjaw, but Nesmith just laughed. 'Pete said that lockjaw would toughen Tommy up,' Helms said. 'He said he doesn't like to baby his kids.' Added Helms: 'I didn't argue with him about it. I didn't want him to think I was some sort of wuss.' ",0
"Officials called the attack a politically motivated massacre. Many of the victims were beheaded, their remains buried in shallow graves. The victims -- at least 13 of them women -- reportedly included a dozen local journalists covering the filing that marked the start of the Philippines election season. Twenty-one bodies were recovered late Monday with three more early Tuesday. Police are looking for more than a dozen other victims. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in a region known for decades of bloody clashes between Islamic militants seeking autonomy in this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. But authorities indicated that Monday's violence on the south island of Mindanao might be the work of political warlords and gangs who wage war against one another with well-equipped private armies. 'This is a gruesome massacre of civilians unequaled in recent history,' said Jesus Dureza, a provincial official. 'There must be a total stop to this senseless violence and carnage.' Ismael Mangudadatu, the candidate for provincial governor, was not in the convoy at the time of the attack. He told officials that his wife, Genalyn, called him by mobile phone moments before she and her entourage were abducted. She said 100 men had surrounded the convoy, officials said. Then the line went dead. Mangudadatu, deputy mayor of the town of Buluan and a political rival of the current governor of Maguindanao province, had received death threats in recent weeks, officials said. General Leonardo Espina, Philippine National Police spokesman, said Tuesday that officials believe forces connected to the Ampatuan family, which has held power here since 2001, were responsible for the carnage. Elections are traditionally violent here, especially in the southern provinces. On May 14, more than 45 million Filipinos will go to the polls to choose among 87,000 candidates vying for 17,000 national and local positions -- including 268 House seats. The convoy was reportedly carrying more than 40 political activists and journalists riding in several vans when it was hijacked near the town of Ampatuan, said Army Col. Jonathan Ponce, a spokesman for the 6th Infantry Division. The bodies were later found about three miles away. 'Many of them (were) beheaded, including probably journalists,' Ponce said. 'Troops are in the area and tracking down those responsible in these killings.' In a statement, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo condemned the violence. 'Civilized society has no place for this kind of violence,' she said. 'No effort will be spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law.' Eid Kabalu, a leader of the country's largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, called the attacks 'gruesome.' Late Monday, the Philippines National Press Club criticized what officials called the withholding of information by authorities on the fate of the journalists. 'We were shocked and grieved to hear what happened to our colleagues,' said Benny Antiporda, the club's president. He said the group would hold a candlelight vigil Tuesday evening at the headquarters of the National Police and the Armed Forces to protest what he suggested was government stonewalling. 'We appeal to the police, the military, the public officials to forget their friendships and other relationships with others and give priority to the search for justice for our brothers,' Antiporda said. Human-rights activists said more than half a dozen journalists are killed each year in political and religious violence in the Philippines. 'The Philippines is a very dangerous place for reporters, especially in the south,' said Vincent Brossel, head of the Asia desk for the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. 'There is a large culture of violence, nepotism and impunity to law and order. There are influential rich and powerful people who do whatever they want. But if this number is confirmed, it will be the biggest slaughter in this country in many years.' Philippines deputy presidential adviser Lorelei Fajardo said authorities 'should immediately identify whoever are responsible for this, in order for the government to show the people that we will not allow this kind of violence.' Special correspondent Jacinto, based in Mindanao, reported from Zamboanga City and staff writer Glionna from Seoul, South Korea. Special correspondent Sol Vanzi also contributed to this report. ",1
"MOSCOW â€” A Boeing 737-800 from Dubai with 62 people aboard crashed early Saturday during a landing attempt at the airport in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian officials said.All 55 passengers and seven crew members were killed, according to a list of victims published on the website of the Rostov regional government. Vasily Golubev, the governor of the Rostov region, said strong winds appeared to have caused the crash, but Russian officials said other factors could also have contributed.The airliner belonged to the Dubai budget carrier FlyDubai, which confirmed that the plane had crashed on landing and that none of the passengers had survived. Forty-four of the passengers were Russian, eight were Ukrainian, two were Indian and one was Uzbek, the airline said.â€œWe are doing everything that we can to help those who have been affected,â€ the airlineâ€™s chief executive, Ghaith al-Ghaith, said in a video posted on Facebook.The Russian Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency, said both of the planeâ€™s flight data recorders had been recovered. In a statement on its website, the agency listed â€œcrew error, technical failure, adverse weather conditions and other factorsâ€ as possible reasons for the crash.Russiaâ€™s Emergency Situations Ministry said the crash occurred at 3:42 a.m. as the plane was making its second attempt to land, two hours after an earlier attempt had failed. A wing of the plane struck the runway, and the aircraft began to disintegrate and burn, the statement said.The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Golubev, the regional governor, as saying that the plane had crashed about 830 feet from the runway. â€œWith all likelihood, the strongly gusting wind, approaching a hurricane level, was the cause of the air crash,â€ Interfax quoted Mr. Golubev as saying.Wind gusts reached 43 miles per hour at the time of the crash, according to the Flightradar24 website, which said there had also been light rain.The Rostov-on-Don airport was closed to air traffic, officials said. It was scheduled to be closed next year, after a new one farther from the city center is completed. The airport served just over two million passengers last year.A well-known Russian pilot, Andrei Litvinov, said Saturday on Russian television that the airport lacks advanced navigation equipment that would make the landing procedure easier for pilots.President Vladimir V. Putin expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, according to a statement on the Kremlinâ€™s website. Mr. Golubev declared Sunday a day of mourning, Interfax said.FlyDubaiâ€™s website said the plane could seat up to 189 people, suggesting that the toll could have been much worse. The airline said 33 of the passengers were women and four were children. The Rostov government said one of the crew members was Russian and the other six were foreigners. Citizens of Greece, Spain and Cyprus were among the crew members, Interfax quoted Russiaâ€™s consul general in Dubai as saying.The Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement online that it had set up a team of at least 50 investigators to look into the crash. The statement made no suggestion that terrorism had been involved.FlyDubai has grown rapidly since it was founded by the Dubai government in 2008, becoming one of the largest low-cost carriers in the Middle East. Its chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, also heads the Emirates airline, but the two operate as separate businesses.Before Saturday, FlyDubai had never recorded a fatal accident. Its most serious safety incident occurred in January 2015, when one of its planes was struck by gunfire while landing at Baghdad International Airport.The plane involved in the Rostov-on-Don crash, a Boeing 737-800 with the registration number A6-FDN, was delivered to FlyDubai by the American plane maker in January 2011, according to the Airfleets.net website. FlyDubai operates a fleet of 50 single-aisle 737s, all of which have been delivered new by Boeing within the past seven years.FlyDubai flies to seven Russian cities, according to the airlineâ€™s website, making it the countryâ€™s third-largest market after Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh.",1
"What's hot: It's a quick and easy three-step questionnaire that asks your travel preferences and delivers a variety of beach resort options, whether you're traveling alone, with the kids, with friends or trying to get away for some romance. The site is powered by Orbitz, but you don't feel as though you're on the Orbitz site until the end when you select the hotel. The site suggests one ideal resort but backs it up with other recommendations. The site qualifies its selections and lets you know whether that particular resort is even just a slight mismatch for your hotel or activity interests. What's not: Often when I clicked through to the end, the hotel was $75 to $100 a night cheaper on Orbitz than it was through the beach site's overview. Once I selected the ideal beach resort, I couldn't use my back browser's button to go back and see the other recommendations. Instead of keeping me on the My Ideal Beach site, it took me to whatever browser page I was looking at before this one -- and if I did that and then hit the forward button, it took me to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I had to start all over. There is a 'back to results' link in your results -- on the lower left side of your resort description -- but be warned that the sound of the ocean waves and details of your dreamy resort might distract you.

"Libraries are generally not places for shouting. But on Saturday night, the actor Paul Giamatti was in the Art Deco lobby of the Brooklyn Public Libraryâ€™s main branch, letting it rip.â€œCitizens!â€ he screamed, his words ricocheting around the room, where 500 people sat in folding chairs. â€œUnspeakable horrors inside the house! The children are dead!â€The occasion was the premiere of â€œHercules in Brooklyn,â€ a new production by Outside the Wire, a theater company that uses dramatic readings of ancient texts to spur community discussions about violence and trauma.If the amped-up emotion might ordinarily prompt theatergoers to eye the exits, it was in keeping with the instruction that Bryan Doerries, the groupâ€™s co-founder and artistic director, gives the nearly 200 actors on his rotating roster: Make the audience members so uncomfortable that they wish they hadnâ€™t come.â€œWe go so extreme emotionally, that each time I think itâ€™s not going to work, that people are not going to respond,â€ said Mr. Giamatti, whose previous Outside the Wire performances include a reading from the Book of Job, at a church in Joplin, Mo., a year after a tornado devastated the town. â€œBut every time,â€ he said, â€œit does.â€The free event, which featured scenes from Euripidesâ€™ play â€œThe Madness of Hercules,â€ followed by an hourlong audience discussion of gun violence, is part of a reinvention of the libraryâ€™s cultural programming under its new vice president for arts and culture, Jakab Orsos. (The play will be presented again in four branch libraries in 2017.)Itâ€™s also part of a continuing expansion for Outside the Wire, which since 2009 has staged more than 600 performances in sites from military bases like GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba; to Fukushima, Japan; to Ferguson, Mo., where it mounted a performance of â€œAntigoneâ€ in September.Each piece starts with a roughly 30-minute reading from a classic text. â€œItâ€™s a pep rally, for lack of a better metaphor, or a psychotropic drug,â€ Mr. Doerries said.Then comes the main event: a response from a panel of community members, followed by an audience discussion.A Greek tragedy is a kind of â€œancient technology,â€ Mr. Doerries told the capacity crowd. â€œWhen you plug it into the right audience, the play knows what to do, and the audience knows what to do in response.â€Before the show, a large, mostly young contingent from Save Our Streets (S.O.S.), a gun-violence reduction program created by the Crown Heights Community Mediation Center, gathered downstairs for pizza and a primer on the play by Mr. Doerries.Not that Euripides was the first thing on everyoneâ€™s mind. Mr. Doerriesâ€™s brief talk was drowned out by applause and whoops when the singer and actress Ashanti joined Mr. Giamatti and Jeffrey Wright, who played Hercules.â€œLet my girl breathe!â€ Mr. Wright said when some S.O.S. participants, wearing shirts and buttons with the groupâ€™s â€œStop Shooting, Start Livingâ€ motto, bounded onstage to snap photos.Upstairs in the lobby, the reading began at full emotional throttle, as Ashanti, reading the part of the chorus, responded to Mr. Giamattiâ€™s full-throated opening with a keening wail of her own, before commanding that he, playing the messenger, tell the story.There were some titters when Mr. Wright first chimed in with his deep voice. But mostly, the audience sat rapt as the actors ran through the story of the ultimate Greek hero, who returned home from his 12 labors to kill the usurper who had taken over his household, only to fall into madness and murder his own wife and children with his invincible weapon, the bow of Apollo. (â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a stretch to compare it to some of the weapons on the street today,â€ Mr. Doerries said.)The climax came when the hero Theseus (also played by Mr. Giamatti) arrived to find his friend cowering in shame, and offered to share his suffering.â€œSoak my clothes,â€ Mr. Giamatti shouted. â€œCover me in the blood!â€Mr. Doerries had summed up the contemporary parallels in his opening comments. â€œWhat is our responsibility as members of a community when unspeakable violence takes place?â€ he asked. â€œHow do we help people wash their hands of the blood?â€During the discussion, community members read back resonant lines they had written down. David Gaskin, the program manager at Save Our Streets Crown Heights, spoke about Theseusâ€™ declaration of friendship for the distraught Hercules.â€œWhen I was a perpetrator of violence, I had many different friends,â€ he said. â€œBut the one who stood out for me was the one who never turned his back on me, no matter what poor decision I made.â€Hailey Nolasco, the project planner for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Anti-Domestic Violence Project, who described herself as being â€œgang-involvedâ€ when she was younger, cited the line â€œA dark cloud of grief surrounds him, he has destroyed his own house.â€ She linked it to her own shame for letting her family down, which had once led her to consider suicide, as Hercules did.â€œI feel like Iâ€™m Hercules in a sense,â€ she said, noting that she had recently earned her masterâ€™s degree. â€œI fought through my 12 labors.â€The discussion moved to the floor, where audience members offered sometimes startlingly personal reflections on violence and trauma. One man remarked on Herculesâ€™ lament that he was â€œcursed from the very beginningâ€ by the violence in his family tree, and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother, Hera, who put snakes in his crib.â€œHere in Brooklyn, thereâ€™s so much anger and rage we see thatâ€™s really pain,â€ he said.Near the end of the discussion, Mr. Doerries called on Mr. Wright, who noted the line where the deranged Hercules, before killing his children, declares that he is killing the sons of his enemy.â€œIn his madness, heâ€™s telling the truth,â€ Mr. Wright said. â€œHeâ€™s recognizing himself as his primary enemyâ€ â€” much, he said, like the community members who had described stepping back from lives of violence, whom he applauded for â€œtheir herculean strength.â€The actors are really just â€œused as props,â€ Mr. Wright said, then gestured around the room. â€œThis is where the story is being told.â€",1
"Sometimes events conspire to put egg on your face. No sooner did I pronounce that most supermarket wines are unimaginative and overpriced last week (a view I still hold, by the way), than I go to a tasting that disproves both.    Badia al Colle Chianti 2015: serve with pizza.   The retailer in question is Morrisons, which deservedly picked up more than 200 medals in this yearâ€™s wine competitions, as well as the accolade of 2016 International Wine Challenge supermarket of the year. You wonâ€™t find the kind of wine that gets beardy sommeliers excited, granted, but Morrisonsâ€™ team has a thoroughly respectable complement of new wines that seems to be driven by a genuine desire to encourage its customers to drink better without fleecing them in the process. The best value is generally to be found in the Wm Morrison own label â€“ the fragrant, minty Western Australia Cabernet (Â£7; 14.5% abv), say, is just lovely â€“ but there are some decent branded wines at a good price, too. Fight your way through the Blossom Hill and Black Tower (yes, they have oceans of those, too) and youâ€™ll find the lush, full-bodied GÃ©rard Bertrand RÃ©serve SpÃ©cial Merlot 2015 (on offer at Â£6, from Â£9; 14% abv), from the Languedoc, which knocks spots off most Saint-Ã‰milions at twice the price. Kudos, too, for stocking the Dolias de Vespassien CÃ´tes Catalans 2015 (on offer at Â£6, from Â£7.50; 13% abv), a less common southern French red from the Roussillon. Itâ€™s a cockle-warming blend of grenache, syrah and carignan that Iâ€™d happily make my everyday drinking. And I loved the labels on the Head Honcho range from Chile, which at Â£6 would make great party drinking, and even more so from 28 November, when theyâ€™ll be on offer at Â£4.75 (Iâ€™d pick the rich, full-bodied 13.5% chardonnay and 13% merlot as the best of the four).   Related: Wine: when to chill bottles   Morrisons has some real bargains at Â£5 or less, some because theyâ€™re on offer â€“ such as the zesty, sauvignon-like Rueda 2015 (Â£5, down from Â£6; 12.5% abv) â€“ others because theyâ€™re regularly priced at that level: at Â£4.75, Badia al Colle Chianti 2015 (12.5%) is better than it has any right to be, while the basic Pinotage 2015 (13.5% abv), which I mentioned here a few months ago, is still one of the best sub-Â£5 reds Iâ€™ve tasted. Given that International Sherry Week starts on 7 November, Iâ€™d also pick up a couple of Morrisonsâ€™ own-label range for just Â£6 a half-bottle and all made by the excellent Emilio Lustau: my favourites are the seductively caramelly Palo Cortado (19% abv) and the treacly (but not sweet) Dry Oloroso (20% abv). The full-size bottle of Fino (15% abv), meanwhile, is ridiculously good value at Â£5.50. matchingfoodandwine.com â€¢ Fiona Beckettâ€™s new e-book, 101 Ways To Enjoy Great Sherry, is out now priced Â£4.50.",1
"Stationed at the front of a mockup of a new 787 airplane cabin, Megan Smith, a Boeing safety instructor, was demonstrating how to open the exit door, activate the emergency slide and get passengers out of the plane in a hurry. Simulated flames flickered outside the cabin windows. Smith, a former flight attendant for Alaska Airlines, heaved open the door and shouted evacuation orders to imaginary passengers, her arms directing the way as assertively as a New York traffic officer's. 'Leave everything! Come this way! Exit here! You, stay at the bottom, help the people! Exit here! Jump! Jump!' she yelled. I could imagine a cabin of anxious passengers complying exactly as ordered. She was asked to repeat this exercise several times so a television reporter could get himself reacting on video. Because I found this amusing, I was then asked if I would like to try to run the drill myself. Sure. Taking my place by the exit door, which I struggled to get open, I hollered: 'Yo, people! Get out now! This way out! Jump! You, pal, get a move on! Leave everything behind! Anybody I see bringing a carry-on with them goes down this slide head-first! Move it, people!' OK, so I don't have a future in the exciting fields of cabin safety or in-flight service. Still, it was edifying to experience firsthand some of the training procedures that Boeing is conducting at its sprawling Customer Experience Center here to show how it is preparing to put its much-delayed 787 Dreamliner airplane into service. The 787, like the double-deck A380 that Boeing's rival, Airbus, brought to the market three years ago, is a plane aimed at the future of air travel, where international flights and expanding global airline alliances are expected to drive industry growth for years. Both planes are remarkable flying machines. The superjumbo A380s now flying are mostly configured comfortably, with 500 to 550 seats in a three-class cabin arrangement, but an A380 can actually carry about 900 passengers in a single-class cabin. The 787s, on the other hand, will carry 210 to 290 passengers. Both planes are aimed at the nonstop long-haul market. Boeing promotes the 787's agility (it can serve airports not big enough for the A380), and the extra fuel efficiency and passenger comfort it offers, compared with older commercial airplanes, because of its light carbon-fiber composite construction. But while about 30 of the 234 Airbus A380s that have been ordered are already plying the skies with various international airlines, the Boeing 787 is still more than two years behind schedule. Last Friday, a day after I visited the Boeing complex here, Boeing said that because of some problems with the Rolls-Royce engines, the first delivery of a 787 (for which the company has almost 850 orders) would be delayed again -- from this December to the middle of the first quarter of 2011. Boeing has set up a worldwide network of centers to train the 787's pilots, flight crews and mechanics, including one in Renton. Pilots, including some who will switch from, say, a long-haul Boeing 777 to the new 787, train first in a mock cockpit built around a flat-panel display system that simulates flying. That system also reduces the amount of time a pilot needs to spend in a so-called full-flight simulator. The real fun, though, comes in the full-flight simulator -- an amazing contraption that costs many millions of dollars and resembles giant lunar-landing vehicles. Inside, pilots train in an exact cockpit replica, while elaborate technological and hydraulic systems reproduce the reality of flight. Lifelike visual displays mimic certain airports, skies and locales, and the actual motion and feel of an airplane in all aspects of flight. Boeing has a building full of full-flight simulators, including the new one for the 787. A gaggle of reporters crowded inside the 787 simulator last Thursday as a Boeing pilot, Gregg Pointon, prepared the mock cockpit for flight. The simulated Seattle airport through the window looked exactly like the real thing, and even the simulated taxiing felt real, though the actual motion simulation was kept turned off, for safety reasons. Pointon snapped shut his seat belt and said, 'We are now ready for takeoff.' Well, the 787 isn't quite ready for takeoff. But soon, Boeing insists, soon. ",1
"A giant torso welcomes visitors to Storm King Art Center, the 500-acre sculpture park in New Windsor in Orange County. Made of perforated stainless steel, it is an architectural structure in the form of a blazer, dress shirt and tie. An archway through its center leads to a small garden lined with white gravel and bordered by hedges. The gardenâ€™s T-shape mimics the imagined shadow of the torso with arms outstretched.The installation is the first full execution of â€œEntrance to a Gardenâ€ as it was conceived in 2002 by Dennis Oppenheim, an artist who produced earthworks, body art, conceptual art and other projects more difficult to classify in a career that lasted more than 40 years. â€œDennis Oppenheim: Terrestrial Studio,â€ one of Storm Kingâ€™s two special exhibitions for 2016, examines his multifaceted engagement with outdoor spaces. The show brings together sculpture, installation, film, photography and sound in the indoor galleries at Storm King, along with seven sculptural installations placed around the parkâ€™s rolling fields.â€œTerrestrial Studioâ€ encourages visitors to explore. It is organized by David R. Collens, the centerâ€™s director and chief curator; Nora Lawrence, curator; and Theresa Choi, assistant curator, in consultation with Amy Plumb Oppenheim, Oppenheimâ€™s widow and the director of his estate. In Storm Kingâ€™s North Woods area, â€œArchitectural Cactus Grove, #1-6,â€ from 2008, is a cluster of six whimsical sculptures that seem to be frolicking in a clearing. To the west in the park, the lime green â€œElectric Kiss,â€ also from 2008, stands 10 feet tall in a meadow, its shape evoking an onion dome, or a teardrop, or a Hersheyâ€™s Kiss.On a grassy slope in the South Fields, 50 four-foot-wide wooden stars lie flat on the ground across two acres. The installation, â€œWishing the Mountains Madness,â€ was created in 1977 at the University of Montana in Missoula, where Oppenheim was a visiting artist from New York City.â€œHere he was in this completely bucolic landscape thinking: â€˜I want there to be some urban energy here. I want to wish the mountains madness,â€™â€ Ms. Lawrence, the curator, said. â€œSo he let the stars fall down from the sky.â€On the slope where the stars are strewn, it is impossible to see more than a few at once. In the galleries, an aerial photograph of the original installation in Missoula offers a more comprehensive view.This is one way that the indoor and outdoor components of â€œTerrestrial Studioâ€ complement each other. Inside are other iterations of the outdoor installations, including a smaller version of an architectural shirt and drawings of â€œElectric Kissâ€ and â€œCactus #6.â€ One gallery features 43 sketches of the fantastical natural elements designed by Oppenheim in 2006 for his series â€œAlternative Landscape Componentsâ€ in the North Woods, selections of those components â€” tubular trees and angular boulders â€” form an alternative landscape of their own.The galleries contain documentation of some of Oppenheimâ€™s earlier, more ephemeral land-based works. The photograph â€œPretty Ideas,â€ from 1974, captures 850 feet of colored flares spelling out those two words as they burned for 10 minutes along the Long Island Expressway. Elsewhere, a topographic map, floor plan and black-and-white photograph chronicle Oppenheimâ€™s â€œGallery Transplantâ€ from 1969. The piece, which existed for four hours, involved transposing the full-size floor plan of a gallery at Cornell University onto an adjacent snowy space, highlighting the shift in perspective and scale.Oppenheimâ€™s â€œA Sound Enclosed Land Area,â€ also from 1969, bridges the indoors and the outdoors. The gallery display is a reel-to-reel audiotape and a map indicating a triangular path in Milan. Playing around the entrance to Storm Kingâ€™s visitor center is the sound of footsteps â€” the very ones Oppenheim recorded as he walked the route on the Italian map.In 1967, Oppenheim sketched his concept for â€œDead Furrow,â€ one of what he called â€œviewing stations,â€ raised platforms where people could stand and look around. The rendering hangs upstairs in Storm Kingâ€™s Museum Building. Though the piece was built as a scale model and an indoor platform in a gallery, it had never been constructed at full scale outdoors until now.One of Oppenheimâ€™s stipulations was that â€œDead Furrowâ€ be located on flat ground with the environment visible for at least a mile in all directions. The South Fields at Storm King met that criteria, and the installation sits there, a massive trapezoidal object framed by rows of aqua PVC pipes. From a distance, the work looks like a truncated pyramid. A stairway bisecting the structure permits visitors to climb to the top to take in the glorious vistas.â€œThe idea is that itâ€™s not just a sculpture itself,â€ Ms. Lawrence said, â€œbut a place where viewers can become part of the work while looking out at the expanse around them.â€Perspective can be confounding at Storm King, where from afar, monumental sculptures can be concealed by the tip of oneâ€™s thumb. Addressing the complexity and allure of measurement, Josephine Halvorson produced three site-specific installations situated across the grounds. Each titled â€œMeasure,â€ they comprise â€œOutlooks: Josephine Halvorson,â€ Storm Kingâ€™s second special 2016 exhibition, also curated by Ms. Lawrence. Ms. Halvorson is the fourth participant in the Outlooks series, which invites an emerging or midcareer artist to create a temporary, site-specific work at Storm King.Each â€œMeasureâ€ is a large-scale wooden ruler that challenges notions of size, time and distance. In the South Fields, the longest of the three, at 36 feet, is painted bright yellow with black lines and numbers. From a distance it resembles a traditional yardstick propped up horizontally in the grass.â€œI was hoping it would align with certain natural features that you could almost measure â€” the length of the ridge of a mountain or the distance between trees,â€ Ms. Halvorson said, standing beside the piece. â€œIt is always changing based on your orientation to it.â€Nearby, another â€œMeasureâ€ rises vertically in the middle of a circle of trees. This one is 12 feet tall and appears to be white but is in fact a pattern of rainbow-hued daubs that shimmer in the sunlight.

"Police Abduct 10 Children From A Family In Kentucky Because Of Their Off The Grid LifestyleBy Michael Snyder The most recent example of this that has made national headlines is particularly egregious. Joe and Nicole Naugler of Breckinridge County, Kentucky just had their 10 children brutally ripped away from them just because the government does not approve of how they are living their lives and how they are educating their young ones. Lets be very clear about this Joe and Nicole had done nothing to violate the law whatsoever. All of their kids were happy, healthy and very intelligent. But because the control freaks running things in Kentucky got wind of their off the grid lifestyle, they have now had all of their children unlawfully abducted from them. A lot of my readers also lead off the grid lifestyles similar to what the Nauglers had been enjoying. The Nauglers own 26 acres in a remote area of Breckinridge County, and their family has been described asextremely happy. But despite never giving them a single warning or a single indication that anything was ever wrong, Kentucky police raided their home on May 6th. The following is how the raid was describedon a website dedicated to this case On May 6th, 2015, Breckinridge Co. Sheriffs officers came to their home, acting on an anonymous tip, and entered their property and home without a warrant and without probable cause. Nicole was at home with the two oldest children, while Joe was away with the others. When the officers left the home, they attempted to block the access road to the family property. Nicole and the two boys got in their car to leave the family property. The got only a short way down the road before the officers pulled Nicole over. During this stop, sheriffs deputies took their two oldest boys from Nicoles custody, providing her no justification or documentation to support their action. Nicole was able to contact Joe briefly by telephone, but only for a short period of time, because she needed to use her phone to record the events. At that point, Nicole had been taken into custody for disorderly conduct (for not passively allowing the Sheriff to take her boys) and resisting arrest. Even though sheis 5 months pregnant, shewas slammed belly first into the cop car and bruised and scraped on both arms. And people wonder why there is such an uproar about police brutality in this country How in the world can a police officer ever justify treating a pregnant woman like that? The police officer that treated Nicole like that should immediately resign. Talk about an utter disgrace. You do not ever treat a pregnant woman like that. But this is America, where we are turning a little bit more into Nazi Germany every single day. You can listen to audio of Nicoles shocking arrest right here. When Joe arrived on the scene, the police continued to actlike Gestapo thugs Joe was able to arrange transportation to meet his wife where the stop had taken place. Joe attempted to get out of the car to speak with the officers and his wife, and to recover the vehicle Nicole had been driving. The Sheriff, with his hand on his sidearm, ordered Joe back into the car. Joe complied with that request. The sheriff informed Joe that he had every intention of making this as difficult as possible for them and that their car would be impounded, despite the fact that Joe was there onsite to recover it. A friend, who had driven Joe to the location, got out of the car to speak with the Sheriff. She was able to convince the Sheriff to let Joe recover the vehicle. Joe also recovered Nicoles cell phone, which had been recording audio the entire time. The Sheriff ordered Joe to turn the remaining eight children over to Breckinridge County Sheriffs deputies by 10:00 a.m., and threatened him with felony charges if he does not comply. Joe did comply with the Sheriffs order, and now their kids have been scattered by CPSamong families in four separate counties As of now, officials have placed the children with four families in four different counties, and as of Friday morning, the parents had not spoken with them. The four families are families that CPS chose families the Nauglers dont know. Shame on you Kentucky. You are supposed to be better than this. One of the most disturbing elements of this entire incident is that Child Protective Services never visited the Nauglers a single time and never gave them any indication that anything was wrong. The following comes fromOff The Grid News Child Protective Services never visited the home, said Ellsworth, who believes the arrests took place because of the parents choice of unschooling for their children, and because of their simple way of life that some would call backwards. The familys Facebook page calls it a back to basics life. They have a garden and raise animals. Deputies apparently were concerned about whether the childrens needs were being met, but friends say they personally have no concerns and that the children are blessed to have Joe and Nicole as their parents. How would you like it if government thugs raided your home and took your children away because they considered your lifestyle to be backwards? What in the world is happening to this country? Like I said earlier, what happened to the Nauglers is not an isolated incident. These kinds of things are happening all over the nation. For example, just consider the abuse that one homeschooling family receivedin New Jersey Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a WND report highlights how parents were interrogated by a CPS caseworker who questioned Christopher Zimmer and his wife Nicole, on everything from their sons homeschool education to questions about vaccines and guns in the house. Michelle Marchese aggressively demanded to enter the property after asserting Christopher Zimmer Jr. was not getting a proper education. Police subsequently arrived and allowed Marchese to enter the home before conducting a warrantless search. The Zimmers are now suing the CPS for $60 million in a case before the U.S. District Court in Trenton. I very much hope that the Zimmers win that case and collect a huge monetary award. All over the nation, CPS officials are running around acting like little dictators and trampling the law. They need the courts to send them a clear message that this is a nation where the rule of law still applies. If we do not stand with families like the Nauglers, control freak bureaucrats will continue to harass families that have chosen to live a basic lifestyle all over the nation. So lets stand with them and make this case viral all over the Internet. And Kentucky, get your act together and send those kids back home. You are supposed to be so much better than this. This article first appeared here at the American Dream. Michael Snyder is a writer, speaker and activist who writes and edits his own blogs The American Dream and Economic Collapse Blog. Follow him on Twitter here. The pigs were probably spying on their Facebook. This site has a lot of similar stories: medicalkidnap I agree. I feel this would be a good place to post something I said two days ago: I would like to take this opportunity to inform anyone who is not already aware that Facebook is essentially a government spying operation. From the Huffington Post: Since leaked documents revealed that Internet companies like Apple, Facebook and Google were giving the National Security Agency vast access to peoples online information under a scheme codenamed PRISM, those Silicon Valley titans have taken pains to deny participation in such a program. But now, the NSAs top lawyer says that just isnt true. When asked at a hearing on Wednesday whether tech companies knew about and assisted with PRISMs data collection, Rajesh De, the NSAs general counsel, said Yes. Not only is Facebook just the shiny, consumer-friendly facade of Federal BlackOPS/Psyops programs, but Facebook has been caught blatantly lying about PRISM and noone even batted an eye (pretty easy to control popular opinion, though, when you control all the airwaves and have the ability to shadowban certain posts on the remaining social media platforms). And not only is everything you do online or through a phone stored permanently, it is actively accessed and proccessed using algorithmic software that allows the fascists to wring value from this massive amount of data and basically know the social networks of the whole populace, as well as what people are considered targets, people who may rock the boat too much and be a threat to the current ruling elite. If you think Facebook is just an innocent platform with no consequences for using it, think again. If you plan on simply going along with the status quo at a time when it is imperative for people to collectively Rise up against widespread oppression, then no it isnt as comparatively dangerous for you to use Facebook. But if you are like me, and understand there is a war going on and it is the responsibility and the duty of all conscious People to agitate for liberty and freedom, then I exhort you to practice security culture when it comes to FedBook or any other spyware used to centralize power in this Information Age even further. A link to help you with this: http://security.resist.ca/personal/securityzine3.pdf And a link putting much everything I said in a humorous, TL;DR version: http://www.theonion.com//cias-facebook-program-dramaticall So be careful out there, brothers and sisters. And rest easy knowing they only operate this way out of fear we will win in the end anyways, and we will win for them as much as we will win for us. Blessings! Just a little off topic, but relevant.. A recent article on zerohedge disclosed that the Swiss Central Bank ,SCB, that prints their money owns over $30 billion of Apple stock. They also own Google and Facebook stock. The SCB is the only central bank to disclose their assets. Is it a coincident that central banks are buying stocks in American corporations that implement the NSA global spy program? The stock market is rigged. The CIA/NSA fund all the startups in Silicon Valley for obvious reasons, global mind control. They CIA/NSA seem to own the stock market, too. Are central banks printing money, converting it to dollars and buying US stocks? That almost sounds like laundering counterfeit money. I think its much more likely the NSA. Snitch? Was likely made up IMO. Well done. Another reason that I dont do Facebook. I thought it was a bad idea way before the NSA stuff. Nowadays I suspicions are confirmed. This is likely a symbiotic relationship with commercial adoption. This is what tyranny looks like. It is imperative that we as a Nation fail this latest Litmus test. Heres the toll free # for Kentuckys version of Child Protective Services. I hope they need a fire extinguisher for their phone. Called two days ago. Thanks. I still cant get over the fact that these two people are over-breeding. I was too disgusted by that to care about them, gotta say. I cant get over the fact that your mother had been over-breeding as well. That you are consuming air disgusts me also. Thank you! Good post. Well, their children were happy and healthy. Maybe we should just bring in a bunch of illegal catholic breeder aliens, or Muslims to fill up the nation if you dont want good people to breed according to YOUR standards. How the frick do you know that the kids are happy and healthy!? Because Michael Snyder says so? Youre right. i saw several pictures in links pictures that people complained about because the kids were muddy and not meeting bloated societal perceptions and the kids were smiling in them and seemed happy. i suppose those may be the only ones shown or publicly available. One wouldnt tend to post the thumbscrews, whips, chains, and beatings whether they take place in the backwoods, the schools, or in crusty upper class homes. Yep. Over at InfoWars: The family also addressed allegations made by their estranged son, i have to admit my prejudice is slipping through. i moved to WVa in Nov 3, 83 onto 40.81 acres of raw land trees and overgrown clear flats on the little bit of bottomland. We lived in a literal tent until my house 12 feet X 24 feet could be built. i had to literally carry everything in on my back and in the wheelbarrow until it was stolen over a quarter mile. No power for 10 years a little generator at the end. Draft horse, milk cow, chikens, at various times goats, sheep, geese. Two kids running buck naked through the woods in summer, our water coming from a gravity spring the water heater an old gas water heater i converted to use wood. One hours fire and you had 30 gallons of boiling water which we ALL were sure to mix heavily with the piped cold water. At the end, i was a state homeschool area representative and yes i know some people shouldnt homeschool. Guess our problems tended toward christian groups trying to take us over rather than people abusing kids which is always a possibility, whether one schools them with others or homeschools them. Bad parenting is bad parenting and smears wherever it tries to grow. So maybe i am making assumptions about the family. The surface things i hear people whine about are bullshit societal paraigms that arent holding water the living space, the kids playing in the mud, etc. Those are all things that can be worked around. If these people havent bothered to do so, then they are not the sharpest knives in the sheath. If the children are (and likely are) as or more healthy than their average age peer group, then the known benefits of avoiding Clorox Mom syndrome are paying off. I have no problem with mud or parents who want to do what they want to do. Everyone screaming at me that the kids are happy and healthy when it is simply what they WANT to believe really pissed me off. And now, the eldest son, possibly a different mother, I am not sure, says his daddy beat and sexually molested him. And commenters dont want to even believe that! We dont know the truth. Plain and simple. Another article: i have sisters with implanted abuse memories put into them by counselors in their 20s. Could this be a parallel? How will we ever know? It really is not our business. If anybody over-bred, it was your parents. ZING! Good one! I agree with you ! Forgot to say I come from a family of 13, and I was the 11 th one !!! So there !!! family of ten. Mother legally blind so only dad could work. He still managed to send us to a private christian school and high school while working construction heavy equipment, etc. (well, they gave up on it taking in me, lol) THAT is one heck of a set of parents! idiot! You are an a$$. I came from a large family. We dont need trolls here. Thats what this county was built,I am ashamed because you dont know your history.Who grew your food?Farmers and Ranchers or monshitzso? See what you get for speaking your mind! A lot of criticism. Yes, it is the country of the free but it is still unwise to be too outspoken. To all your other criticizer I have only one thing to say: it is the country of the free, you are supposed to have the right to your own opinion, even if the opinion differs from others.. I can handle being criticized in this medium where one comment stirs people into reaction. It is not a big deal. In this day and age with what is happening on the planet people should not be creating 14 new people. It is ridiculous! Poor city slicker. Only child, Im guessing? Agreed. Having that many when there are so many starving is the height of selfishness. They see the increase in tyranny and want to provide more subjects? If theres one thing this story illustrates is that you cannot protect them. There is a lot of disinformation online. I dont even know if I should believe this story. I used to live in KY. Anyhow, regarding natural resources like food and water, and medicine, housing etc, I used to think we are definitely too many ppl on this planet. But then I read there is enough food for everybody, food scarcity is a lie, a way to manipulate us. I thought okay, but there is definitely not enough water. Then last night I came across a video claiming drought in California is a lie! Jeeezus! *shaking my head* So what is true??? Re this KY family, if they even exist, why would a woman give birth to so many kids? OMG! That idea is just overwhelming to me. Giving birth is not exactly picnic in a park! And then feed them and clothes them and make sure they are safe etc. And then life happened and now the kids are gone. So obviously this idea was not so good Is it right to take the kids away from their parents? Of course not! Now the kids will have a psychological problem for the rest of their lives. Our society just doesnt work, for anybody! Many self sufficient country folks (all over) have big families to help out. What better community than family? This doesnt belong in the same breath as big families playing the welfare game in our big cities. Yep. On the farm or homestead, kids are your affordable work force. Lots and lots to do means a new kid every year or so, until all the work is covered. I would rather see these ten kids in one family, with two parents, being raised in a healthy human manner any day over ten kids, in ten families, with twenty parents, half of whom are not present, living stunted lives in little apartments, addled with Ritalin and antidepressants so they can tolerate the boredom of being brainwashed in public schools. The corporatocracy that we are living under in this country doesnt want us living off the grid as self-sufficient independent thinking individuals. They only want good little mind controlled soldiers that follow all directives with no questions asked. As a former teacher I applaud parents that home school so their children are not indoctrinated into the lies of public education. Our history books have been skewed by the progressives in this country. CPS has no good intentions as they are paid royally to steal children for illegal adoptions and pedophiles. Please help this family fight the good fight. Yes sir, this is 100% true. Individual / personal / food/ mind SOVEREIGNTY means independance from their satanic economic /political system. They can not allow people to think and to be free! Ok, here we go: I did! Breckinridge County Sheriffs Office Phone:(270) 756-2361 Email: info@breckinridgecountysheriff.net Thank you, FM. Did you get any kind of response? Yes, the lady said she was besieged with profane calls and the phones were ringing all the time. She said there was a criminal charge against the Dad, gave the number for Clerk of Court but I never called. My point was the kidnapping of the yunguns. This is a time when we should all be examining our allegiances: Good post! A thinker!^^^^^ You can bet the criminal charge against the father is something they came up with after they took the kids. That makes it either bogus or a direct result of the Sheriffs actions. Either way, of all our governments intrusions into our lives these days, what truly is most despicable is what theyre doing to our children. Imagine if that $60 million were not allowed to be paid by the taxpayers, but instead was required to come out of the departments POLICE BUDGET? This shit would end virtually OVERNIGHT, would it not? Time to start bending the ear of your congresscritters, people. Ask him or her to sponsor a law to that effect: the taxpayers are SICK AND TIRED of paying for the crimes and misdeeds of cops. Sponsor a law that requires monetary judgements against police forces to be paid for out of the budget of the PD itself; the law must specify that the cost may NOT be passed on to the taxpayers. And where does the money from the PD come from? You are so, SO CLEVER!! The difference is this: if it comes out of the police budget, THEY DONT GET ANY MORE MONEY UNTIL NEXT YEAR. Payments from the general fund are handled differently; no matter how many pay-outs for settlements there are, they get paid. Its magic. The police budget is written once a year. If they have to pay out a judgement, theyre gonna have to sell some armored vehicles and computers, some weapons or whatever, and tighten their 46-inch belts. Start holding officials of all kinds PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE for that which they are complicit? The problem with taking the judgement out of the PDs budget is it punishes the good cops along with the bad. Thats why I advocate mandatory, individually purchased, professional malpractice insurance for anyone to work as a cop, and eventually expanded into a work requirement for all public servants, including these slimeballs at CPS. If we have to buy car insurance to drive, these government employees shouldnt mind having to purchase liability coverage when they are in a position to do such great harm to members of the public. How can I help? Who do I contact the sheriff ? Dont the voters decide who they want for sheriff? Maybe the next time he runs the folks should in his county should be made aware of the job hes doing. You do not own your children. Once you sign a birth certificate, they become wards of the state. I would equate government to the police. I would not use WND as a source, since they are a leading Obama is a Kenyan advocate and have had many scandals. We need the government to reign in the police. To conflate gubmint with police brutalty is to mistake a perverted part for the whole. Is it possible the children were not being educated? Could they read, write, etc? I am weary of the government is evil meme; unaccountable undemocratic government is evil. We need to create a democratic republic. We will not achieve this by claiming, as Reagan did (before expanding the government more than anyone in history), that government is the problem. Fascist government is the problem; democratic government is the solution. It does no good to blame progressives, since they are the champions of democracy and uniformly are calling for an end to the Police State. The Kentucky police are NOT progressives, folks. Stop scapegoating those who are working to make government accountable and end police brutality. The government IS evil. Im weary of it too, but it is a meme that is well founded in both history and modernity. You arent going to reform it. That is just the devil (George Soros, Koch Brothers, etc) whispering in your ear. Once government becomes big and powerful and all intrusive, it becomes the play thing of the rich and powerful. You cant reform that, all you can do is keep it small and dispersed; like the Founding Fathers envisioned. -Ken Repost updated info with shortened links for easy copy and paste.

New Earth Nation web site: http://www.newearthnation.org http://www.ThePeoplesBranch.org Their first mistake was using facebook. Second was opening the door for the sheriff since there was no warrant. Third was not having lawyer on speed dial. Connecting a couple of dots I wish more people could see: Part of the problem here is government acting as employer of last resort for people with worthless liberal arts degrees in order to prop up the value of those degrees for the banks who are making a fortune on the student loan bubble. Once those newly-minted petty dictators get the job they are so eager find some reason to exist that they go out and do the stupidest shit imaginable without a moments reflection on what theyre doing. Multiply that action by the millions of bureaucratic interactions with citizens from every conceivable alphabet soup agency and you have a recipe for national collapse. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. Declaration of Independence This family looks and sounds like they are decent, happy and caring people. I think the new world order cops and CPS workers cant tolerate this. They are a perfect target for these Nazis because they are a normal family with honest values. What kind of satanic cop slams a pregnant woman into a car? These cops and CPS workers need to be fired. I hope the family sues them personally and the agencies they work for. If I were the family, I would get the names of each and every person who participated in this action and, along with the agencies that sent them, sue each of them for entry without a warrant, the taking of the children, again, without warrants and failure to act without probable cause. Abuse to the pregnant mother as the officer did is what I deem assault without provication. The case against Common Core is here where parents choose to give their children a decent education and care. Get yourselves a good attorney who will K A! Living off the grid should be the way we all need to be. This is another stage of socialism; much like Hitlers Germany and the Soviet Union was. We need to be as free as we want to be. The people need to stand up and be counted along with their neighbors. We all need to stand together and let those bastards know we will not be shut down! Sock it to em. We must bring back our Constitution as the only form of being a Repbulic! Democracy be damned! Socialism be damned! If you havent yet figured it out, thats the direction theyre takeing us! We the people do not have a central government and havent had it since before 1913! We are not the stakeholders; the corporations behind the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CORPORATION are the board of directors and stake holders. They run things in Washington D.C.! Wake up and smell the garlic! Oh, one more thing; we are the first of many nations that they plan to take down to form a one-world government under the International Monetary Fund (IMF). No more U.N.; no more indivudual countries! All will be under one government with a billion or less people to govern. Their plan is to kill the majority of those existing today to meet that goal. Learn about the Illuminati who has been working on this for, at least 4 centuries. We Americans have been a stumbling block until now. As I see it, we need to continue to be a stumbling block in every way possible! As some country folk would say: ether youre with us or agin us! Which are you? Like it or not, I might suggest getting away from Facebook. Because you know whos looking at Facebook activity, dont you? Or if you feel a compulsion to continue with FB and living off the grid, at the very least I wouldnt share things like how you school your children, how you live, etc. If youre using the Internet, youre really not off the grid. Just a friendly suggestion! ",0
"Boom: Trump Reveals First Department Hell Cut As President... Liberals Howl In Horror In an interview with Fox News host Chris Wallace this past weekend, GOP front-runner Donald Trump made outrageous claims about what he has planned for the Department of Education. I may cut Department of Education, Trump told reporters. I believe Common core is a very bad thing. I believe that we should beyou know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York. I think it should be local education. Extreme as his views may be, many Americans agree with Trump on this one, believing that the Department of Education has turned into a massive bureaucracy, more focused on indoctrinating students with biased liberal ideals rather than educating them on the facts. Trump believes that getting rid of the Department of Education would give parents more power over what their children learn. The focus, he hopes, would once again be on subjects like literature and math. Whether Trump could actually follow through with his proposal to eliminate the Common Core remains to be seen. While Common Core is promoted indirectly by the Department of Education, it is still adopted individually by state governments, and the federal government does not control it, Daily Caller reporter Blake Neff commented. What do you think? Do you support Trumps proposal? ",0
"Ginger Induces Leukemia Cell SuicideHeather Callaghan This majestic culinary darling does way more than help with nausea and upset stomach. Way more. Recently, a milestone study found that ginger actually fights several species of drug-resistant bacteria. It is well documented in studies for shrinking tumors in mice with hard to treat cancers. Here we have yet another study on gingers mighty effects against a relentless cancer. Shogaol, specifically 6-Shogaol, was the subject of a 2013 Chinese study, in vitro and in vivo. In the petri dish and in the living being. Their process, using6-shogaol compound from ginger (Zingiber officinale): I did not see where there were measurements of the tumors while inside the mice. Rather, after the 20 days, the mice were killed and their tumors were further studied in a solution that revealed cancer apoptosis. I was hoping to see the mice declared cancer-free eventually since they already confirmed apoptosis three times in vitro, and it would have been interesting to see the length of time for the leukemia to disappear. In 2003, another similar study on a different component of ginger gingerol found that it too, induced the death of leukemia cells, by fragmenting their DNA. Of course, it appears that these studies are largely done, and with isolates, to see if pharmacological drugs can be made (patented) for cancer treatment. Still, it is eye-opening to see the astounding medicinal effects of this spice. Ginger has no side effects, unless there is an allergy. But consultation should be sought before eating/taking extra amounts if taking diabetic, heart, blood thinner medication or painkillers (even over-the-counter). Its a bit worrisome that the FDA has taken extra scrutiny towards spices like ginger even as medicinal science continuously announces its marvels. Did you know that the FDA recently did a 200+ page report attempting to paint spices as a deadly substance??It actually coincides with when the above study was published. When you see the summary of their report, you will see how ridiculous that portrayal is! When it comes to tuberous roots, organic matters. You can get organic bulk ginger spice, surprisingly inexpensive (compared to non-organic spice bottles at the grocer) at the health food store. They also like to carry liquid extracts, ginger candy and soda pops infused with real ginger. You can also make your own. Make your own tea by boiling water and adding a peeled, chopped or grated inch of ginger and add sweetener. Heather Callaghan is a natural health blogger and food freedom activist.

"UN human rights envoy Tomas Ojea Quintana will begin a five-day visit to Myanmar next week, a UN official said Thursday, as the military junta prepares to hold national polls this year. 'He will be there 15th to 19th February. It's his regular programme, he's supposed to visit the country two times a year,' said Human Rights officer Hannah Wu. A Myanmar official confirmed the visit and said Quintana would visit Sittwe in western Rakhine state, close to the country's border with Bangladesh. This will be the envoy's third visit to the country after a previous mission last year was postponed, and comes a day after the regime jailed an American human rights activist despite demands from the United States for his release. On Wednesday a court in the military-ruled nation sentenced Kyaw Zaw Lwin, to three years in prison on fraud and forgery charges. United Nations special rapporteur Quintana expects to meet with Myanmar foreign minister Nyan Win but not with junta head, Senior General Than Shwe during this visit, said Wu. She said he will report back from his visit to the Human Rights council and then to the General Assembly. Following Kyaw Zaw Lwin's sentencing Wednesday, one lawmaker called for consideration of tougher sanctions against the Southeast Asian regime. It came as the US engages in a cautious dialogue on improving relations and as the military government plans to hold polls in late 2010. Democracy advocates and Western governments fear that the elections will lack credibility as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and the courts continue to lock up dissidents opposing the regime.

"More Research Shows that Bacteria are Beneficial, Not HarmfulPatrick Gallagher, Contributor Recent research shows that we actually dont know a whole lot about when we look at the leaps and bounds we took to disinfect and cleanse nearly everything we own. In a research project entitled the Human Microbiome Project (much akin to the Human Genome Project of great relevance), researchers show that bacteria and microbial bodies are actually much more beneficial than they will ever be detrimental. Not only do bacteria keep people alive and healthful by helping to strengthen the immune system, but they also explain in a broad sense why people are so different when it comes to vaccinations and diseases. The research has been conducted between 200 scientists at 80 different institutions in order to gain a better understanding of the microscopic world and livelihood of the bacteria in relation to the human body and its systems. The project analyzed the genetic material of bacteria from around 250 healthy people; the results came as a bit of a surprise, finding as many as a thousand different strains per person, and that many of even the disease carrying bacteria coexist normally with millions of other bacteria. This gives us a very broad understanding of why some individuals are more susceptible to infections and disease and why others are nearly invincible to the same disease-causers. It is also probable that these many millions of microorganisms may contribute to a wide array of conditions like asthma and even obesity. The research was released last Wednesday, and promises great change coming to the research playing field. It is a great mystery why these essential little buddies were so understudied, with scientists knowing very little about them for an extended period of time. Allegedly, when bacteria and microbes were actually studied, they were done so in a largely unnatural environment, leaving the bacteria to act differently than they would under normative circumstances. The research has only recently reached prominence, with new methods and techniques to sustain the study of microscopic organisms. Until we gain a broader scope of understanding these little machines, you can rest assured that they are mostly harmless and in fact are quite beneficial to your health. If you are a bacteriaphobe keeping things around you almost constantly disinfected, you may very well be putting yourself at greater risk with all of the harsh chemicals being used to maintain that cleanliness.

"Kenny Rogers Entire Career Is In Jeopardy After Falling Terribly Ill, He Needs Our Prayers Now The legendary Kenny Rogers had to postpone his nationwide tour. The tour was planned to be his farewell tour. Kenny announced in September his Final World Tour: The Gamblers Last Deal. Kenny has been in the music industry for 5 years and has given us amazing music. His influence has reached well beyond music, and he will never be forgotten. Recently Rogers had to push back his April 7th show in Tulsa to July 14th. Rogers was scheduled to perform at the Hard Rock Hotel in Tulsa, but reports came out that he was suffering from health issues. No official word of what the health issues are, but we can only pray that Kenny heals. Kenny is getting old, so his health has to be heavily monitored. Kenny made the quick decision to put himself in the hospital when he fell ill. In an interview he said, Its happily sad or sadly happy. Im going to do a big worldwide tour, and its going to be my last. Im going to say goodbye at that point; Ive done this long enough. Kennys retirement was influenced by his long years of service, and his 11-year-old twin boys Kenny has given enough of his life to country music, and he deserves to be honored. Will you send your prayers to Kenny? ",0

"Drawing on satellite data and foreign intelligence reports, Pentagon officials confirmed Monday that North Korea was in the late stages of developing a military parade with an operational range of 5,000 miles. With its current capabilities, the DPRK could, at a moments notice, deploy a lavish parade to the Japanese mainland or Guam, potentially expanding the reach of its festivities to the West Coast of the United States by years end, said Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work, who explained that the communist dictatorship had bolstered its arsenal of massive full-color Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung banners, and that its top choreographers were drilling soldiers on how to maneuver in dazzling synchronized formations for maximum visual effect. We estimate that by early 2016, several major U.S. population centers, including Seattle and Los Angeles, could be within their sights. And if this progress goes unchecked, American citizens could one day wake up to the sounds of the Korean Peoples Army State Merited Chorus and Ensemble, followed by the horrific spectacle of 20,000 people dancing in matching traditional costumes as a solitary, weeping woman sings songs in praise of Kim Jong-un. Pentagon sources confirmed that any test of a North Korean military procession would be the countrys first since 2010, when a parade veered sharply off course and wound up in the East China Sea. ",0
"In February 1969, I watched the first episode of Kenneth Clarkâ€™s famous TV series, Civilisation. IÂ can still picture him, standing onÂ barbaric northern headlands, explaining that â€œourâ€ civilisation had barely survived the collapse of the Roman empire. We had come through only â€œby the skin of our teethâ€. It was an incongruous scene: Clark â€“ Winchester and Oxford educated, connoisseur and collector, former director of the National Gallery â€“ looked every inch the toff as he walked in his brogues and Burberry over the battered countryside, where wellington boots and a woolly would have been more appropriate. But I tingled slightly as heÂ repeated that phrase, â€œby the skin ofÂ our teethâ€. I was just 14, and it had never struck me that â€œcivilisationâ€ might be such a fragile thing, still less that it might be possible to trace a history of European culture, as Clark was to do, in 13 parts, from the early middle ages to the 20th century.   Civilisation had shown us that there was something in art and architecture that was worth talking, and arguing, about   A few years later, now more a devotee of John Bergerâ€™s Ways of Seeing (a TV series and book devised in hostile reaction to Civilisation), I began to feel decidedly uncomfortable with Clarkâ€™s patrician self-confidence and the â€œgreat manâ€ approach to art history â€“ one damn genius after the next â€“ that ran through the series. I was very doubtful, too, about the image of wild barbarians at the gates that Clark conjured up in that first episode: it was as crude an oversimplification of barbarism as his dreamy notion of ideal perfection was an oversimplification of classicism. Nonetheless, Civilisation had opened my eyes, and those of many others; not only visually stunning, it had shown us that there was something in art and architecture that was worth talking, and arguing, about. Some of the best chapters in James Stourtonâ€™s careful biography discuss the making of this series. Clark was then in his early 60s and a considerable catch for its commissioner David Attenborough, who was trying to give the first wave of colour TV on BBC2 a more highbrow image than it had acquired in theÂ US. What better than a series that would feature â€œall the most beautiful pictures and buildingsâ€ of the last 2,000 yearsÂ of western European history? Despite the commonly held belief that Clark was an upper-crust scholar plucked from some dusty museum basement who luckily proved to be a â€œnaturalâ€ on screen, he had already made dozens of programmes for ITV, including one featuring an argument with Berger over Picassoâ€™s Guernica (the two men were ideological enemies but personal friends). He was the obvious man for the job. Less obvious was theÂ director assigned to the series: MichaelÂ Gill, father of theÂ critic AA Gill, who didÂ not share Clarkâ€™s aesthetic viewpoint (â€œMichael would probably have wanted to be theÂ barbarian at the gate,â€ his wife observed). To begin with, getting the pair to collaborate was, according to one BBC source, rather like â€œmating pandasâ€. For some viewers, Civilisation was life-changing. In the letters Clark received after the broadcasts, no fewer than nine correspondents claimed theyÂ had been dissuaded from suicide simply by watching (modestly, Clark wasnâ€™t sure whether to believe them). Even the Sun hyped Clark as â€œthe Gibbon of the McLuhan ageâ€, and he was promptly given a peerage. The rumour was that Mary Wilson said toÂ Harold, after one of their regular Sunday evening viewings in 10 Downing Street: â€œThat man must go to the House of Lords.â€ And so he did. But Civilisation was not an instant ratings success. At its first showing, it captured less than 2% of the available audience (compared with 35% for TheÂ Forsyte Saga). And Berger was not the only critic of Clarkâ€™s â€œtop-downâ€ approach to cultural politics; others complained that they were watching the elitist musings of an Edwardian critic. Clarkâ€™s silly jibes at â€œpseudo-Marxistsâ€ (for some reason, a notch below â€œrealâ€ ones), and his boasts of being a â€œstick-in-the-mudâ€ laid him open to this.   On one of his ITV programmes on 'good taste' he seems to have taken a line closer to Grayson Perry than to Brian Sewell   As Stourton shows, some of the criticisms do not stick. Although the programmes concentrated on western Europe, Clark was not blind (as he was charged) to other artistic traditions: he had been devoted to Japanese art since childhood. And however patrician his manner, he was a lifelong Labour voter. In fact, in one of his ITV programmes on â€œgood tasteâ€ he seems to have taken a line closer to Grayson Perry than to Brian Sewell. But Stourton frankly concedes one glaring omission in Civilisation. This was a â€œgreat manâ€ approach in the most literal sense. Hardly any women got a look-in, and when very occasionally they did, it was not as creative artists or even patrons, but as hostesses, temptresses, Virgin Marys, or something woolly called the â€œfemale principleâ€. Almost the only woman credited, briefly, with an independent role was Elizabeth Fry, the prison reformer â€“ and, it so happens, the ancestor of one of Clarkâ€™s long-standing mistresses. Contested though they still are, it is far easier to evaluate Clarkâ€™s TV programmes than the rest of his life. On the surface, his was a golden career. Born in 1903 into a family of the idle richÂ (â€œmany richer â€¦ few idlerâ€, as he put it), he made his way through school and university against the usual background of loyal nannies, vicious schoolmasters and cranky dons, before managing to get himself apprenticed briefly to the art historian Bernard Berenson in Florence. A glittering CVÂ followed: keeper of fine art at the Ashmolean, director of the National Gallery, keeper of the kingâ€™s pictures, chairman of the Independent Television Authority, and so on, ending upÂ a member of the Order of Merit, an august body that he found, predictably enough, full of his old pals. Reading between the lines of Stourtonâ€™s account, it seems clear that he was good at big ideas, not so good atÂ attention to detail (always a peril forÂ men, like Clark, who donâ€™t actually need a salary to survive). His tenure at the National Gallery is a case in point. Appointed when he was just 30 in 1933, he scored some great successes: he installed electric light; he opened up early on FA Cup final day to encourage fans to visit; he masterminded the evacuation of the major paintings to the Welsh mines during the second world war; and he reinvented the gallery as aÂ cultural centre for wartime London (with hugely popular concerts organised by Myra Hess). Yet the staff were almost entirely against him, and it was partly their opposition that led to his resignation as soon as the war ended. Clarkâ€™s supporters tend to paint his subordinates as small-minded bureaucrats, narrow scholars or, occasionally, psychopaths; and so they may have been. But one of Stourtonâ€™s anecdotes hints at a different story. Clark was going home one evening when he was surprised to see a newspaper hoarding: â€œNational Gallery. Grave Scandal.â€ ItÂ turned out that one of the galleryâ€™s accountants had had his fingers in the till for years, and all had been made public. Although director, Clark knew absolutely nothing about it.   It is dangerous to investigate marital wars from beyond the grave, and even more presumptuous to try to apportion blame   But it is women, again, who are the most uncomfortable part of Clarkâ€™s story. His wife, Jane, had read history at Oxford; they married in 1927 and soon had three children (including Alan Clark MP, of Diaries and other fame). By the end of the 30s, Clark â€œstarted being unfaithful to his wifeâ€ and had multiple dalliances â€“ â€œa vigorous private lifeâ€ in Stourtonâ€™s euphemism â€“ until her death in 1976. Jane, meanwhile, is said to have become increasingly difficult and dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. It is always dangerous to investigate marital wars from beyond the grave, and even more presumptuous to try to apportion blame. But biographers should watch their rhetoric and at least let the different parties keep their dignity. Stourton tries, but does not always succeed. There is little room for independent women in Stourtonâ€™s version of Clarkâ€™s life. Jane wins his praise early on for her elegance and her dress sense; she was â€œa natural and beautiful hostessâ€. When she doesnâ€™t fit that type, she gets written up as the monstrous, unstable spouse of a long-suffering husband: â€œThe more she tormented him, the more he sought solace elsewhere.â€ Stourton occasionally recognises that this logic could be reversed: â€œThe more he screwed around, the more screwed up she got.â€ There are simply different ground rules for men and women. When Clark breaks down and cries in a gentsâ€™ lavatory in Washington DC in response to a rapturous reaction to Civilisation, that is a sign of his sensitive ambivalence to fame. When the women cry, they are being hysterical. The mistresses generally fare no better than the wife. Stourton only mentions in passing that Janet Stone, the descendant of Elizabeth Fry and mistress of Clark for almost 30 years, was an important photographer in her own right. But he does clearly see the poignant side of a discovery made after Clarkâ€™s death: a box of letters from her that he had never bothered, or brought himself, to open. Clarkâ€™s television presentation of women as objects of desire or inspiration was not all that far from the way women in his own life continue to be portrayed: â€œa muse without a roleâ€, as he once dubbed Jane. â€¢ Kenneth Clark: Life, Art and Civilisation is published by HarperCollins.

"The young Nigerian man had visited Yemen once before, in 2005. But by the time Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab returned this past August, again to study Arabic, he appeared to have become a very different person, more deeply religious, more of a loner, and forsaking Western clothing in favor of a long, white traditional Islamic tunic. Abdulmutallab also expressed an inner confidence and a certainty of purpose, according to former teachers, classmates and housemates. The 23-year-old seemed to be on a mission, spending long hours in a mosque, often missing classes, and even ordering a classmate to stop smoking in front of him. In more than a dozen interviews on Wednesday, those who know him shared impressions of the man who joined them for language school in Yemen this summer only to vanish in October, and emerge on Christmas Day on a Detroit-bound flight from Amsterdam with chemical explosives allegedly sewn into his underwear. At a dinner in September, he demanded that classmate Sigurd Sorensen walk behind him as Abdulmutallab said his evening prayers. 'What faith are you?' Abdulmutallab demanded. 'Christian,' Sorensen replied. 'Islam is the only true way,' Abdulmutallab then declared, as Sorensen recalled. 'If you want to go to heaven, you should accept it.' Teachers said Abdulmutallab bears little resemblance to the man they remembered from four years earlier. 'He was so open-minded in 2005. He spoke to everybody,' said one of his instructors at the San'a Institute for the Arabic Language. The teacher spoke on the condition of anonymity because Yemeni security officials had ordered the school's staff not to talk to journalists. 'In 2009, he barely came to class. I wouldn't see him in a week.' When Abdulmutallab spoke, he was courteous. He didn't publicly express radical thoughts, didn't lash out against U.S. policies in Iraq or Afghanistan. He didn't express core Muslim grievances such as Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He often handed out money to poor Yemenis and African migrants. 'He was friendly. He always smiled. We didn't see an ounce of aggressive behavior,' said Ahmed Mujaeb, a teacher. 'I felt sad when I heard what he had done. I asked myself `Why?' This is a big question mark.' Yemeni investigators are trying to piece together what happened to Abdulmutallab between October and December, when he apparently left Yemen. He allegedly told U.S. authorities that he was equipped and trained by a bomb maker linked to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which has claimed responsibility for hatching the plot to bomb Northwest Flight 253. It has shined an unwanted spotlight on the institute, housed in a tan three-story mansion with a tree-speckled courtyard in the historic quarter of San'a. Since 2001, it has taught Arabic to hundreds of foreign students, including many Americans. It offers one religious course, a basic introduction to Islam to help students learn classical Arabic. Yet students and teachers said they feared the school would be unfairly tainted as a jihadist breeding center. Under the online name Farouk1986, Abdulmutallab wrote in a June 2005 posting that the school was 'great.' He gushed about Britons and Americans in the capital and about eating at Pizza Hut and KFC. When he returned this time, he was not seen eating fast food, said Ahmed Hassan, a classmate from Singapore who lived next door to Abdulmutallab in the school's residence building. Every morning, he woke up before dawn to pray. He ate breakfast in his room or alone in the cafeteria, his housemates said. He spoke Arabic well and had improved tremendously since 2005, when he was enrolled in a beginner's class, his instructors said. Abdulmutallab did not listen to music; the only sound his housemates heard from his room were his recitations of the Koran. One day, the call for prayer from a mosque floated into the classroom. Abdulmutallab stood up and informed the class that he must go and pray in the mosque, and left, Hassan recalled. In September, during the last 10 days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, his teachers said Abdulmutallab performed itikaf, a spiritual retreat where devout Muslims spend evenings and nights in a mosque, worshiping and reading the Koran. The few instances he had conversations with classmates, the discussion inevitably turned to religion. 'He believed in the infallibility of the Koran,' said Matthew Salmon, a Canadian student. Abdulmutallab spoke English with a West African clip, and frequently mixed his conversations with Koranic terms. He didn't discuss his family or personal matters, Hassan said. Most students thought he was poor; they were surprised to learn recently that his family is wealthy. His room was spare; when he was inside, he often locked the door. One day, Hassan managed to peek inside, he said. There were no photos of Abdulmutallab's family. The only item on his desk was a laptop. The walls were bare. By the end of September, Abdulmutallab seemed intent on learning Islamic sharia law. He told Hassan and other classmates that he wanted to attend an Islamic school in Hadhramaut, a southern province where al-Qaida has deep roots. He told other classmates that he wanted to be an engineer. One night in late September, Salmon said he asked Abdulmutallab how long he was planning to stay at the school. He told Salmon that he would stay another month or two, and then return to London, where he attended college. The next day, Abdulmutallab disappeared. 'He didn't even say goodbye to us,' Hassan said. Questions and anger now swirl around the school. Some classmates wonder if his decision to return to the school was merely a pretext, a way to gain entry to Yemen to conduct a terrorist act. Others made it a point to show a visiting journalist one of the school's textbooks -- to prove there were no references to jihad or terrorism. 'My roommates and I are very frustrated,' Salmon said. 'This damages the credibility of the school, of Yemen, and of Islam itself.' ",1
"Debuting yet another arrangement of the classic song Wednesday night, singer-guitarist Eric Clapton reportedly treated a sold-out crowd at the Gwinnett Center to an even slower, somehow mellower acoustic version of his original 1971 hit Layla. When he played those first 45-second-long notes of the opening riff, that was when everyone recognized it as Layla and just went nuts, concertgoer Leslie Friedrich said of the 87-minute rendition, which according to listeners featured three eight-minute choruses and a half-hour jazzy piano interlude before concluding with a lengthy fadeout. I heard those brushed drums and glacial tempo and my jaw dropped. I was like, Wow, he actually managed to come up with a more lethargic and neutered acoustic jazz-blues version of Layla than ever before! How did he pull it off? Sources confirmed Clapton followed Layla up with a vigorous, electric double-time version of Tears In Heaven. ",0
"Oh, but I had such high hopes for The Young Pope, the new drama series that starts next week on Sky Atlantic. The early signs were so promising. News leaked out in bits, each more deliciously risible than the last: Jude Law to play a young pope! Called Lenny Belardo before the white smoke turns him into Pius XIII! Who drinks Diet Coke Cherry for breakfast and was raised by a nun â€“ played by Diane Keaton! The stage was set for a masterpiece of fibrillating absurdity. â€œCatholic Dynasty!â€ I thought, and hugged myself as rumours of a Â£3m budget per episode started to swirl. â€œVatican Gossip Girl!â€   Related: The Young Pope review: Jude Law's sleek pontiff shines in Sorrentino's Twin Peaks   In these troubled times our need for perfect trash TV is greater than ever, but in vain do I scroll through the terrestrial and cable menus, Netflix, Amazon Prime and the rest. Hope rises and is quickly dashed. Last yearâ€™s The Royals, for example, was swollen with possibilities. A modern royal family headed by Queen Elizabeth Hurley and King Vincent Regan? BRING IT. Alas, la Hurley, as ever, doomed the venture by being so bad she was bad, and Reganâ€™s eyes flashed so unmistakably with the message â€œCall my agent! For the love of God, call my agent!â€ that it was hard to lose yourself in the fiction. Even Joan Collinsâ€™ arrival in a purple satin dress as Hurleyâ€™s mother, the grand duchess of Oxford (yes!), opining that: â€œYou have failed as a wife, as a mother, as a daughter and â€“ most devastatingly of all â€“ as a queenâ€, couldnâ€™t save things. More recently, thereâ€™s Designated Survivor. Its high-concept â€“ US government wiped out by bomb, mild-mannered lowest member on the cabinet totem pole Tom Kirkman (played by Kiefer Sutherland not playing Jack Bauer) is suddenly president â€“ looked like a winner. But it hasnâ€™t run with any of the glorious possibilities offered by the set-up. Instead, Kirkman keeps doing things like asking his bellicose generals to be a bit surer of their facts before sending in troops, and making sure he gets back to his family in time for supper every night. Not the kind of gorgeous nonsense Iâ€™m looking for. And nor, it turns out, is The Young Pope. The first episodes were screened at the Venice film festival and got rave reviews. It turns out that Paolo Sorrentino, maker of shiny-bladed satire on Italian politics Il Divo and the clever, ravishing The Great Beauty, has signally failed to give in to any of his baser instincts. His young pope is an illiberal ideologue who wants to funk absolutely nothing up but restore the power, mystique and murky glory of the church by dragging it back to the doctrinal purity of the past. Great. Another quality drama choking up our watchlists. Oh, God of crap TV, why hast thou forsaken us? Jeanâ€™s soap skill    â€˜We didnâ€™t realise back then how good soap actors were.â€™ Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock   Staying with the world of television for a moment, let us pay our respects to actor Jean Alexander, who has died at the age of 90. She played of course (from 1964 to 1987) the Rovers Return charlady Hilda Ogden, an inveterate gossip in curlers and headscarf, and although not quite a battleaxe (despite making husband Stanâ€™s life traditionally miserable), always ready to do screeching battle with anyone or anything that crossed her. You believed in her so absolutely that it was always a shock to see Alexander â€œin real lifeâ€, without curlers or pugnacious expression, and hear her normal voice. We didnâ€™t realise back then how good soap actors were, because in the days before reality shows and papped photos of anyone lower than Princess Di, we never saw the joins. Perhaps sometimes letting daylight in on magic lets you appreciate it more. Not often â€“ but sometimes. Book ends We are moving house and â€“ unless science in the next three weeks comes up with a way of storing them on the ceiling â€“ I have to get rid of literally half my books.

"â€˜This is the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to bounce,â€ says the John Lewis website as it introduces its new Christmas advert. Bridget has always loved to bounce. Sheâ€™s put in the hours, endlessly springing up and down on her bed as her dog Buster watches from the sidelines. Arguably, there is no individual better qualified to bounce than Bridget. Sheâ€™s been preparing for this her whole life. Finally, Bridget is given her big shot. Someone has assembled the trampoline of her dreams in her back garden. On Christmas morning, Bridget wakes up and sees the thing sheâ€™s always longed for. She races downstairs. She has a clear shot at the trampoline. But then, at the last moment, Buster barges in ahead of her and grabs the trampoline for himself. Bridget stands on, astonished that something as stupid as a dog could have beaten her to it. Meanwhile, Buster gets his stupid dog mouth and his stupid dog parasites all over the trampoline, ruining it for anyone who ever wanted to use it afterwards. Thatâ€™s right, Buster the dog is Donald Trump. Buster the dog is Donald Trump, Bridget is Hillary Clinton and the trampoline is America. Thanks for rubbing it in, John Lewis.    Theyâ€™ve done the impossible â€¦ made 2016 worse. Photograph: John Lewis/PA   Perhaps Iâ€™m reading too much into this. Perhaps the John Lewis brain-trust got together and looked around them. Perhaps they looked at the state of the world, with Brexit and Trump and the rise of the right and all our dead heroes. Perhaps they looked at their own past offerings, where a woman relentlessly ages and a penguin is forced to seek companionship with a monstrous cadaver and the worldâ€™s loneliest man dies in space. Perhaps they took stock of all this and shrugged â€œsurely a dog on a trampoline wonâ€™t upset anyoneâ€. In theory, the intention was admirable. But this year has been such a domino stack of heartbreaking disappointment that John Lewis wouldnâ€™t have had to do much to make everyone cry. An advert where a weekend dad saves up to buy a toy for his son, soundtracked by a sad cover of Heroes by David Bowie. An advert where an old man sits on the white cliffs of Dover watching Europe fade into the distance, until he cheers up when a cartoon Belgian monkey gives him a gift voucher. Literally just a static card reading â€œ2016â€. Any of these would have been a shot straight to the tear ducts.    There is no individual better qualified to bounce than Bridget. Sheâ€™s been preparing for this her whole life. Photograph: John Lewis/PA   But no. This year John Lewis tried to be happy.

"Evan Riedel has made reference to his Sept. 6 Scrabble victory over girlfriend Amy Vanderploeg 'about 200 friggin' times' in the days since, Vanderploeg reported Monday. Amy Vanderploeg with boyfriend Evan Riedel, who is still carrying on about his Sept. 6 Scrabble win. 'Evan will not let that Scrabble game drop,' Vanderploeg, 23, said. 'Constantly, he'll say stuff like, 'Do you need help reading that magazine article? I know your vocabulary isn't the best, judging from that round of Scrabble we played.' Give it up already, Evan.' The oft-alluded-to match, which took place at Vanderploeg's apartment, was a decisive 382-183 victory for Riedel, who needed less than one hour to dispense with his girlfriend of three years. Upon winning, he performed a brief victory dance and began verbally taunting his vanquished opponentbehavior that has continued unabated nearly two weeks later. 'He works the word 'esteemed' into conversation whenever possible and then says, 'Gee, I really like that word 'esteemed,'' Vanderploeg said. 'He was so proud that he'd used up those four e's in one word and used all seven tiles.' Vanderploeg added that by placing 'esteemed' across a triple-word-score spot on the board and earning a 50-point bonus for using all his letters, Riedel was able to, in his words, 'rack up a sweet 77' on the turn. In addition to constantly bringing up his best moves, Riedel has relished pointing out errors Vanderploeg made during the game. 'Whenever we see a cat now, he goes, 'C-A-T... Cat!' as a way of making fun of me for putting down such a simple word at one point,' Vanderploeg said. 'Then he usually says, 'You know where cats like to walk? On the catwalk!' That's because instead of putting down 'cat,' I could've added my 'cat' onto the word 'walk' that was already on the board and gotten a lot more points.' Vanderploeg said she should have anticipated Riedel's post-victory arrogance on the basis of his behavior during the game. 'Evan was getting way too into it,' she said. 'At one point, he got a double-word score and actually screamed, 'Boo-ya!''' By the midpoint of the game, Riedel had developed an elaborate tile-picking ritual, shaking the bag vigorously before blowing into it and chanting, 'Come on, come on, please... gimme the Xs, Js, and Zs!' According to Vanderploeg, such theatrics made it difficult for her to concentrate on the game and contributed to her poor showing. Scrabble game box. 'There were several times when I put down the first thing I thought of, just to get the stupid thing over with faster,' Vanderploeg said. 'Every time it was my turn, Evan would lean across the board and stare at me. It started to get really annoying, but whenever I told him to stop, he'd say, 'What's the matter? Can't take the heat?'' According to noted psychologist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum, Riedel's behavior is rooted in his outsider status during childhood. 'Awkward and ungainly as a boy, Evan never excelled in athletics,' Wasserbaum said. 'He did, however, find shelter in academia. It is natural, then, that he is most comfortable asserting his male competitive instincts in this arena. His frequent allusion to the Scrabble victory can be likened to a male peacock extending his colorful tail plumage before the female bird. With his constant boasting, Evan is not actually trying to annoy his girlfriend but instead impress her and win her approval.' Riedel has engaged in boardgame-victory braggadocio in the past, carrying on about triumphs in such games as Trivial Pursuit, Balderdash, and Outburst. 'One time, we were playing Scattergories with [longtime couple] Jeff [Weitz] and Kimberly [Alford], and Evan got so bad, I had to cut the game short,' Vanderploeg said. 'We didn't see them for, like, three months after that.' While Riedel admits to mentioning the Scrabble victory frequently, he denies any wrongdoing. 'I'm just teasing Amy, is all,' Riedel said. 'Besides, I can't help it if I possess a superior vocabulary and stellar word-formation skills. Cha-ching!' ",0
"Manufactured Civil Unrest: Leaked Docs Prove The Real Goal Is Federalizing Americas PoliceBy Melissa Dykes Now, leaked documents from George Soros Open Society Foundation show that the organizations goal behind funding the Black Lives Matter movement is ultimately to federalize Americas police forces. The document is aptly called, Police Reform: How to Take Advantage of the Crisis of the Moment and Drive Long-Term Institutional Change in Police-Community Practice. Breitbart reported: The document states that the Foundations U.S. Programs (USP) was seeking to use this moment meaning the so-called crisis in policing following high profile shootings and charges of racism to create a national movement for police reform. States the board meeting document: The federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives. In addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Taskforce, the White House recently launched the Policing Data Initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust, voice, and solutions to improve community policing. TheDepartment of Justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice, reduce implicit bias, and support racialreconciliation. We are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best USP can use this moment to create a national movement. We have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform, including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work, and opportunities for collaboration. As we proceed, we will engage the funder network we helped to establish, the Executive Alliance on Men and Boys of Color, which now includes forty foundations. Creating a national movement sounds expensive could that be what the $33 million Open Society gave Black Lives Matter was for? The memo goes on to discuss how Obamas Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which has met with Black Lives Matter members including leader DeRay Mckesson at the White House, is not only influenced by Soros-backed organizations who have testified before it, but that Bryan Stevenson, one of the nine members on the task force itself identified as Founder and Executive Director, Equal Justice Initiative, also directly serves on the board of the Open Society Foundations U.S. Programs. According to another leaked Soros doc, the Open Society Institute specifically created OSI-Baltimore in 1998 as a social change laboratory for the institutes programs. Can it really be a coincidence that so much of the BLM campaign, violence and unrest has been focused there? Oh, and dont forget Black Lives Matter leader DeRay Mckesson currently lives in Baltimore at the home of wealthy philanthropists who not only donate to the Baltimore chapter of OSI but who used to sit on the Open Society Institute board there. OSI mentions Ferguson and Baltimore specifically, two cities that have been subject to federal oversight following massive civil unrest in response to highly publicized police violence. In fact, this goes hand-in-hand with the DOJ releasing a scathing report on Baltimores police department just a few weeks ago All of this will be used to take away local and state control over police departments and put it in the hands of the already highly centralized federal government. At this point, more than 30 police departments across the nation have fallen under federal oversight following mass civil unrest, DOJ lawsuits, or threats to cut federal grants. Following the Dallas police shootings, what was President Obama predictably doing? Calling for more federal oversight of Americas police. Black Lives Matter members seem to be under the false assumption that they can somehow get rid of the police in America all together. Maybe thats what their community organizing handlers have told them; however, thats not the ultimate goal of the people who are paying to manipulate them for mass social change. While the epidemic of increased police violence and shootings is a serious issue that does need to change, twisting these events through manufactured civil unrest to justify federalized control of police will centralize the power in even fewer hands how exactly is that going to fix race relations or make America less of police state? George Soros didnt say. Melissa Dykes is a writer, researcher, and analyst for The Daily Sheeple and a co-creator of Truthstream Media with Aaron Dykes, a site that offers teleprompter-free, unscripted analysis of The Matrix we find ourselves living in. Melissa and Aaron also recently launched Revolution of the Method and Informed Dissent. Wake the flock up! We will make America stink.

Then, we have to hold them financially rsponsble for their crimes against us. If we dont, they will drive us into the ground. They are cowards and they just love to oppress people. This is what happens when you let capitalist corporations run the country. It is always, always about the money. It will make no difference to the elite whether you vote for communist democrats or fascist republicans after all that is how we got into this mess. But by all means go buy some more guns and ammo to help the elites with their program of federalizing you with your local police department. Remember a registered weapon means they know who you are and where you live. That way they will know who shot that bullet in there head.

If Hillary grapples her way into the White HouseAll is lost. Soros looks like he has a couple of extra scrota or scrotums under his eyes! You would think with all his money hed have them castrated off. But Lisa, it is not the Catholic church who runs all the private central banks or all of the media corporations and they also do not own Hollywood. How would you explain that? The Catholic church also does not have so many lobbyists in Washington and there is very little evidence that they have dual passport citizens operating in the American government. I am of the opinion that whoever is running the USA government, and UK, France, Germany, etc, is also in control of the Catholic church. I may be corrected with sufficient evidence. But Brett, You will have to study for yourself. Good luck. Happy hunting. I believe I already responded to your email, and this is a duplicate.

"The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has defended his derided World Cup expansion plan and backed the idea of more than one country co-hosting the tournament in order to keep costs down. Following the first meeting of the newly rebranded and expanded Fifa Council, which replaced the discredited executive committee, Infantino unveiled a vision document named â€œFifaÂ 2.0â€ and a slew of targets and plans.   Related: Would an â€˜Atlantic leagueâ€™ be good for European club football?   One of the items discussed was the plan to expand the World Cup to 40 or 48 teams from 2026. Infantino said no final decision would be taken until January but that there was a â€œpositiveâ€ feeling towards the idea of expansion. The Fifa president defended his proposal to increase the competition to 48 teams, comprising 16 seeded countries and 32 more who would play off for the opportunity to play in the group stage. â€œWhether it will be 40 or 48, it was a positive discussion. I donâ€™t agree it will dilute the quality,â€ Infantino said. â€œIÂ would like to remind you that in the last World Cup, England and Italy were eliminated by Costa Rica. The level of football is increasing all over the world. â€œIn a 48 team format, the quality would be higher because the 32 teams would have a play off. The quality would improve and not decrease in any way.â€ He said the idea would increase excitement and boost football participation and finances in those countries that qualified, rejecting criticism of the fact that 16 teams would have to fly home after just one match. â€œIt is certainly an exciting moment for that country and the players and the fans. You donâ€™t just travel to play a friendly but a match that is extremely important. â€œLook at England â€“ one of the matches that is most followed is the play-off to get into the Premier League.â€ Among a raft of promises, Fifa said it would increase the amount awarded to each member association to $1.25m over four years from the current $400,000, while introducing more oversight of World Cup ticketing and local World Cup organising committees.   Related: Gordon Strachan to remain in charge of Scotland against England in November   Infantino promised that the 2026 World Cup bidding process would be â€œabsolutely transparent and bulletproofâ€ and said he would encourage the idea of co-hosting to keep down costs. â€œWe want to ensure World Cups are in future sustainable events. That is why, for example, we are in favour of co hosting,â€ said the former Uefa general secretary. World Cup bids and ticketing arrangements have previously been closely linked to corruption allegations. The move to ensure more oversight over ticketing arrangements could spell the end for its long standing contract with ticketing partner Match. Infantino, elected in February in the wake Fifaâ€™s near collapse amid a corruption crisis, said a new womenâ€™s football division would be responsible for doubling global participation from 30m to 60m within the next decade. â€œOur vision is pretty simple but pretty clear as well â€“ to promote the game, protect its integrity and bring the game to all. How will we do this? By investing, by innovating, by involving the fans more. We live in a digital world and we have to embrace this.â€ As part of the scheme, he also said Fifa would also act as a venture capital company investing in start up companies and joint ventures with an â€œentrepreneurial mindsetâ€. Infantino insisted that his â€œFifa 2.0â€ vision differed from any number of earlier initiatives under disgraced former president Sepp Blatter. â€œItâ€™s not words, itâ€™s actions in terms of good governance, controls and transparency processes,â€ he said.",1
"The New Zealand government is giving itself more say in overseas investment in this country. A review of investment regulations will see ministers now taking into account economic interests to ensure investment is in the country's best interests. New Zealand Finance Minister Bill English on Monday announced regulations that will allow ministers to take New Zealand's economic interest into account when considering investments in sensitive land. English said a press conference on Monday that ministers will be able to consider a wider range of issues, including large-scale ownership of farmland. The change gives them more tools for rejecting applications, he says. There will also be a new mitigating factor which will require involvement of New Zealanders in investments, such as having a head office here or Kiwi directors on boards. The new regime will take effect in December. ",1

You're really that into this?' 'We want prospective students to know that they will actually have to study the U.S. legal system. As in, the whole thing.' Word of the new requirement has already reportedly caused a 450 percent spike nationwide in applications to graphic design schools. ",0
"The government is to release new ratings for maternity wards across England to allow prospective parents to compare and contrast services in NHS hospitals, as part of a drive to reduce instances of stillbirth and brain injuries during labour. Maternity data detailing the frequency of accidents within clinical commissioning groups and the health prospects of expectant mothers â€“ including the percentage of smokers, for example â€“ will be collated to form England-wide ratings.  In a major speech on Monday, Jeremy Hunt will also unveil proposals to allow the NHS to offer compensation automatically to parents of babies left stillborn or brain-damaged because of poor care. The health secretary wants parents of children starved of oxygen at birth no longer to endure a wait of about 11 years for compensation.    Stillbirth rates are still among the highest in western Europe, according to Jeremy Hunt. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images   At present parents often become embroiled in lengthy and costly legal action against the NHS, forcing grieving families to fight for months or even years before the health service agrees to compensation.  Bereaved parents often have to instruct solicitors to determine the cause of their childâ€™s death, with health bosses sometimes denying any liability until they are ordered to pay compensation by a judge.  Under the new scheme, which was first recommended by Tory peer Baroness Cumberlege earlier this year, an independent rapid resolution and redress scheme will be set up to investigate tragedies in childbirth, which would quickly decide whether compensation should be paid. The launch comes as figures showed that the cost of settling claims with parents whose children are damaged at birth has reached more than Â£0.5bn. The NHS as a whole pays out more than Â£1bn a year in negligence compensation, and reducing that cost is seen a key way of mitigating the financial crisis facing the service.   Related: BMA: Theresa May lacks understanding about seriousness of NHS crisis   In February this year, Cumberlege recommended the investigations into maternity cases and any subsequent payouts are made by the trusts without any court involvement. The recommendation was one of several made by Cumberlege, who has been chairing an independent review of maternity services in England. The new proposals are modelled on a Swedish scheme, which has reduced serious avoidable birth injuries by about 50% in the past six to seven years.  Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to end the culture where going to court was an automatic â€œfirst stepâ€ and instead foster a culture of transparency so the NHS can learn from its mistakes. Under the plans, claims by parents who believe medical errors have caused severe damage to their children â€“ such as cerebral palsy or brain damage â€“ would be assessed by investigators working independently of the NHS trust. The investigators would quiz NHS staff and parents and look at medical records.    Compensation for errors around the time of birth has reached more than Â£500m a year. Photograph: Sturti/Getty Images   Their findings would be presented to a panel of legal and medical experts who would decide whether any compensation is warranted and arrange for payments to be made to the family.  The government hopes the scheme â€“ which would assess about 500 cases a year â€“ will help dismantle what it sees as a â€œlitigation cultureâ€. It would work out far cheaper for the NHS than the current route, in which cases go to court or are settled out of court, often for millions of pounds.  Data from the NHS Litigation Authority shows the compensation bill to the NHS for errors around the time of birth is rising, reaching Â£509.3m in 2015/16 â€“ up from Â£393.2m in 2014/15. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the plan, which will be the subject of a consultation, would not â€œlockâ€ parents into the scheme and would let them bring their own legal case against the trust if they were unhappy with the outcome.  The new maternity ward ratings follow Huntâ€™s recent creation of similar schemes to help patients and families compare the quality of cancer and dementia care. However, once they start being published, they will set out details for services within each of the NHSâ€™s 209 GP-led clinical commissioning groups rather than the 156 acute hospital trusts with maternity services. Hunt said that openness about the quality of care will help empower patients and reduce wide variation in care quality. In a speech at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Hunt will also set out Â£8m for training, with at least Â£40,000 available to each NHS trust in England.  A Â£250,000 maternity safety innovation fund will pilot new ideas for improving care, while maternity ratings for every part of England â€“ using data that already exists â€“ will be published together to encourage greater transparency.  Other measures being unveiled include a new Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch, modelled on the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A new tool will also standardise the investigation of every stillbirth and early baby death so lessons can be learned. Hunt said: â€œOur NHS maternity staff do a fantastic job under huge pressure. But even though we have made much progress, our stillbirth rates are still among the highest in western Europe and many on the frontline say there is still too much of a blame culture when things go wrong â€“ often caused by fear of litigation or worry about damage to reputation and careers. â€œThese comprehensive measures will give practical support to help trusts improve their approach to safety â€“ and help to foster an open and transparent culture so that the courts become a last resort not an automatic first step.â€ In May this year a new report revealed figures that 15 babies are dying every day in the UK from stillbirth, during labour or within four weeks of being born.  The report was published by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries in the UK), which is a collaboration of academics and medical experts.  It found that there were big variations in death rates across the country, from 4.1 to 7.1 per 1,000 births. Women from the poorest backgrounds and black and Asian mothers run a higher risk that their baby will die in the womb or soon after birth. In nearly half of all stillbirths (46%), the causes of death are unknown, said the report. The biggest causes of death in the early weeks of life are complications following birth (32%) and congenital anomalies such as heart defects (28%), and very premature birth (13%). The MBRRACE team flagged up the need for research into premature births and also called for every maternity unit to review and record the causes of death in the same way to try to discover why there are such stark variations around the country. James Taylor, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Scope, said of the new plans: â€œFinding out that your child has been affected by a birth injury can be a very traumatic time for parents.  â€œSo it is very positive that the government will be listening to disabled people and their parents on how the NHS can better support families when serious issues do occur during birth.â€  ",1
"So when I read a recent study on avoiding boredom in marriage, I fell asleep in a rocking chair in front of the TV and woke up when the news was over. Then I woke up Sue, who was snoozing in an easy chair, and we both went to bed. The next morning, I went to see the co-author of the study, Dr. Arthur Aron, a professor of psychology at Stony Brook University on Long Island, N.Y. For Aron, who worked on the study with Irene Tsapelas, of Stony Brook, and Terri Orbuch, of the University of Michigan, this was his latest scientific triumph. His previous study, conducted last year, showed that brain activity in longtime spouses who are still in love is the same as the brain activity in MRIs of newly romantic couples. 'You could take an MRI of my brain,' I told Aron, 'but you probably wouldn't find any activity.' 'That would mean you are still out of your head in love with your wife,' he suggested. It goes without saying, but I will say it anyway, that Aron is brilliant. He proved it in the boredom study, which was published in Psychological Science, by finding that, 'Couples need to make their lives together more exciting.' Aron knows what he's talking about because he has been married for 35 years to Dr. Elaine Aron, a psychotherapist who is the author of several books, including 'The Highly Sensitive Person.' 'I'm not bored in my marriage because my wife and I like to go out on little dates,' Aron said. 'We enjoy doing different things, like finding new places to eat.' 'My wife and I do, too,' I said. 'Maybe,' Aron replied, 'my wife and I will run into you and your wife some Saturday night.' If they do, it probably will be at the burger joint that Sue and I recently found. It's actually a neighborhood bar called Reese's 1900 Pub, which is a few miles from another neighborhood bar we also frequent, Billie's 1890 Saloon. Finding a new place to have delicious burgers and cold beer has added considerable excitement to our marriage. Just the thought of deciding whether to have fried onions or bacon as toppings, or whether to go with cheddar or Swiss cheese, is enough to make us giddy with the spark of first love. Then again, it could be the beer. Still, like many empty nesters, Sue and I have discovered that it's the little things that prevent boredom from creeping into a marriage. That's because, after putting both of our daughters through college and marrying one of them off, we don't have enough money left for the big things. True, we went to Barbados last year for our 30th anniversary, the first time we had been away together, just the two of us, to a place with postcards and palm trees, since our honeymoon in Hawaii. We vowed to go back this year but ended up staying home and going to a local beach that did not, I regret to say, have postcards or palm trees, although it did have a snack bar. Now that the weather is cooler, Sue and I spend our exciting Saturday nights either at home watching rented movies and trying to stay awake to the end or going out on little dates for burgers and beer. And if we should happen to run into Arthur and Elaine Aron, the first round is on them. For his next burger adventure, Zezima, a freelance writer, is contemplating the leap to Dijon mustard.

"Take a look at the two shapes in the image above. Imagine they were real-world objects that youâ€™d found, and you had to give them a name â€“ one has to be called â€˜boubaâ€™, and the other has to be called â€˜kikiâ€™. Which name would you assign to which object? It probably makes intuitive sense to assume that the way that we map sounds onto objects, with the exception of onomatopoeias, is arbitrary. Take the word â€˜ballâ€™ for example - at face value, thereâ€™s nothing obvious that links the actual spherical object with the name that weâ€™ve assigned to it. But is this mapping truly, completely random? In 2001, UCSD scholars VS Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard asked a group of participants a similar question to the one posed above, in which they had to guess which of the two figures was a Martian â€˜boubaâ€™, and which was a â€˜kikiâ€™. 95% of those participants picked the left object for kiki, and the right object for bouba, even though these were completely novel words being matched with drawings that they had never seen before.  Whatâ€™s going on? The bouba/kiki effect actually finds its origins in much earlier work, by German psychologist Wolfgang KÃ¶hler in 1929. The experimental setup was essentially the same. KÃ¶hler showed people shapes similar to the ones above, and asked them which was a â€˜taketeâ€™ and which was a â€˜malumbaâ€™. By now you can guess what the majority of participants said.    Related: Ambiguous figure illusions: do they offer a window on the mind?   Why this phenomenon occurs isnâ€™t entirely clear, but Ramachandran and Hubbard have speculated that it may be due to the nature of the connections that exist between sensory and motor areas of the brain. For example, the visual shape of the object - either round or spiky - is linked to the shape that our lips make when we say that corresponding word - either open and rounded, or narrow and wide. In turn, this is linked to the way that our tongue moves in order to generate the word itself; kiki requires you to make a â€˜sharpâ€™ movement of the tongue on your palate, where as bouba involves a more â€˜roundedâ€™ movement. These similarities all increase the likelihood that bouba will be linked to the rounded object, and kiki to the sharper, spikier object. In later work in 2003, Ramachandran and Hubbard provided supporting evidence for this theory. In that paper, they found that damage to an area of the brain important for language called the angular gyrus resulted in a person being much less likely to match the rounded object with the word bouba.  The effect is interesting, because it helps us to shed light on the potential evolutionary origins of language. The fact that so many people, and even young children, tend to consistently assign a sharp word to a spiky object suggests that, at least in some situations, the way that we map sounds onto objects isnâ€™t random. Instead, thereâ€™s some sort of natural constraint or system in place that helps us to build those maps. And while having that sort of framework on its own might not be fully sufficient for language to have originally developed, it may at least have provided a building block for the emergence of verbal communication.",1
"AHMEDABAD, India â€” Late last month I bought an Indian comic book online. I hadnâ€™t bought one since the mid-80s, when I was a boy and would walk to the bookstore in my hometown in Kashmir to pick up copies of D.C. and Marvel Comics, or Amar Chitra Katha, a series based on the lives of major contemporary, historical and mythological figures in India. My latest purchase, â€œBal Narendraâ€ (â€œBoy Narendraâ€), was styled after Amar Chitra Katha.I turned the pages with a mixture of anticipation and foreboding. The book purports to tell stories from the childhood of Narendra Modi, the longtime chief minister of Gujarat, one of the richest states in India, and the polarizing Hindu nationalist candidate for prime minister in the ongoing election. The tales are part of Mr. Modiâ€™s high-octane campaign effort to present himself as a bearer of good governance, growth and efficiency.Bal Narendra, the son of a tea-seller in a small town of Gujarat, embodies many virtues: courage, wit, diligence, fairness, compassion. He sells tea at a village fair to raise money for flood victims. In devotion to the religious tradition of his village, he swims across a lake full of crocodiles and hoists a flag on top of a temple on an island. When some bullies rough up a weaker child at school, he marks them by throwing ink from his fountain pen on their shirts and denounces them to the principal.The publishers of the comic book â€” available exclusively from Infibeam, an Amazon-like online retailer run by a Gujarati entrepreneur close to Mr. Modi â€” would have you believe that now that he is all grown up, Bal Narendra is just as brave, clever and just. If anything, however, Mr. Modiâ€™s public record paints the picture of a leader unapologetically divisive and sectarian.It was on his watch as chief minister that more than 1,000 people, many of them Muslims, were killed throughout Gujarat in 2002, when rioting erupted after some 60 Hindus died in a burning train in Godhra. A Human Rights Watch report that year asserted that the state government and local police officials were complicit in the carnage.Mr. Modi has rarely visited the camps of the Muslims displaced by the violence or apologized for his governmentâ€™s failure to protect a minority. Instead, he has described the reprisal killings of Muslims that year as a simple â€œreactionâ€ to an â€œaction,â€ namely the deaths of the Hindu train passengers â€” and has said he felt as sad about them as would a passenger in a car that accidentally ran over a puppy. His only regret, he once told a reporter for this paper, was failing to manage the media fallout.Even as candidate for prime minister, Mr. Modi has not given up his sectarian ways. Nor has his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Of the 449 B.J.P. candidates now running for seats in the lower house of Parliament, all but eight are Hindu. The partyâ€™s latest election manifesto reintroduces a proposal to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on the site of a medieval mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya, even though the destruction of that mosque by Hindu extremists and B.J.P. supporters in 1992 devolved into violence that killed several thousand people.Amit Shah, a former Gujarat minister and Mr. Modiâ€™s closest aide, is awaiting trial for the murder of three people the police suspect of plotting to assassinate Mr. Modi. (Mr. Shah calls the charges a political conspiracy.) He has made speeches inciting anti-Muslim sentiment among Hindu voters, including in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, despite an outbreak of sectarian violence there last September.The problem isnâ€™t just about rhetoric. Judging by the evidence in Gujarat, where Mr. Modi has been chief minister since 2001, a B.J.P. victory in the general election would increase marginalization and vulnerability among Indiaâ€™s 165 million Muslims.Ahmedabad, Gujaratâ€™s largest city, has become a wealthy metropolis of about six million people and three million private vehicles. Office complexes, high-rise apartments, busy markets and shopping malls have replaced the poor villages that once dotted the land. The city has a mass transit system called Peopleâ€™s Path, with corridors reserved for buses.But Ahmedabad ceases to swagger in Juhapura, a southwestern neighborhood and the cityâ€™s largest Muslim ghetto, with about 400,000 people. I rode around there last week on the back of a friendâ€™s scooter. On the dusty main street was a smattering of white and beige apartment blocks and shopping centers. A multistory building announced itself in neon signs as a community hall; a restaurant boasted of having air-conditioning. The deeper we went into the neighborhood, the narrower the streets, the shabbier the buildings, the thicker the crowds.The edge of the ghetto came abruptly. Just behind us was a row of tiny, single-story houses with peeling paint. Up ahead, in an empty space the size of a soccer field, children chased one another, jumping over heaps of broken bricks. â€œThis is The Border,â€ my friend said. Beyond the field was a massive concrete wall topped with barbed wire and oval surveillance cameras. On the other side, we could see a neat row of beige apartment blocks with air conditioners securely attached to the windows â€” housing for middle-class Hindu families.Mr. Modiâ€™s engines of growth seem to have stalled on The Border. His acclaimed bus network ends a few miles before Juhapura. The route of a planned metro rail line also stops short of the neighborhood. The same goes for the cityâ€™s gas pipelines, which are operated by a company belonging to a billionaire businessman close to Mr. Modi.â€œThe sun is allowed into Juhapura. The rain is allowed into Juhapura. The wind is allowed into Juhapura,â€ Asif Pathan, a 41-year-old resident, said with sarcasm. â€œI get a bill for water tax and pay it, but we donâ€™t get piped water here.â€ The locals rely on bore wells, which cough up salty, insalubrious water.Mr. Pathan has been living in Juhapura since 1988, when his father, a retired district judge, bought a house here from a Hindu man. â€œMy father said, â€˜When the storm comes, you donâ€™t get more than 10 minutes to run,""â€™ Mr. Pathan explained, referring to the threat of sectarian violence. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Juhapura was a mixed Hindu-Muslim neighborhood, but with the string of sectarian clashes in Gujarat â€” in 1985, 1992 and 2002 â€” more Muslims began to move here, seeking relative safety among people like themselves. Prejudice begets riots, and riots only exacerbate prejudice, and so the population of Juhapura has almost doubled since 2002.After the 2002 riots, Mr. Pathan, a teacher, began tutoring children in Juhapura. Then he quit his job and, with his fatherâ€™s support, bought a large patch of land by the highway that runs through Juhapura. In 2008 he started his own school. Now, around 1,300 children there attend classes in both Gujarati and English in airy classrooms. â€œWe simply have to help ourselves,â€ Mr. Pathan said.But self-help only goes so far, in Juhapura, and elsewhere. A large chunk of Narol, an area on the southern edge of Ahmedabad, was once a patch of uninhabited brushland that belonged to a wealthy political family. After Mr. Modiâ€™s government refused to help relocate victims of the 2002 riots, several secular and Islamic organizations and small-time Muslims developers got involved. They bought land, cleared it, and built tenement houses, asbestos-lined roofs and all. About 120 homes were assigned by lottery to Muslims displaced from Naroda Patia, in northeast Ahmedabad. The cluster is called Citizensâ€™ Nagar, or Citizensâ€™ City, and wherever you stand in the self-made neighborhood you can see, half a mile away, a big brown mountain: the largest garbage dump in Mr. Modiâ€™s boom city.When I walked around Citizensâ€™ Nagar last week, the brown mountain was burning into thick gray clouds under a harsh afternoon sun. The wind pushed pungent fumes toward the tenements. I struggled to breathe and feared I would vomit.â€œEvery year we have lived here I feel weaker,â€ said Mohsin Syed, a wiry 25-year-old from Naroda Patia who now works as a carpenter in a factory nearby. â€œI canâ€™t run like I used to. I donâ€™t eat like I used to.â€ He complained of pain in his joints, said he needed surgery for kidney stones, and added, â€œThis place, this pollution, takes a decade off oneâ€™s life.â€His father, Najeebudin Syed, a large man with a short beard, told me that the many petitions he has sent to local authorities describing living conditions in the area have been ignored. â€œOnce a week, they bring garbage from the Ahmedabad hospitals â€” bandages, medicine, refuse of all kinds. The smell is so foul, so bitter, that we know in a minute it is from the hospitals,â€ he said.Some days, the carcasses of dead animals are brought to the dump.That evening, back in my hotel room, I read another story from the comic book â€œBal Narendra.â€ The boy is at a camp of the National Cadet Corps â€” the Indian version of the Eagle Scouts â€” when he notices a pigeon in a tree entangled in the strings of a kite. Holding a razor blade between his teeth, he climbs up, cuts the lines and frees the injured bird. I remembered Juhapuraâ€™s putrid water and the carcasses on the brown mountain, and wondered how a Prime Minister Narendra would wield that blade.

"The Love and Fear of Asking Questions: Writing ContestNed Pamphilon 2012? Yeah! Mayan prophesies aside, let there be an out-pouring of world love peace; a BBC properly serving the public; clean food water production; public awareness of Codex Alimentarius Agenda 21; the reintroduction of raw milk into regular retail outlets; awareness that calorie concept is merely a marketing tool since burning food is not an accurate reflection of the human digestive system; increased whole grain food consumption over refined grain consumption; a free Gary McKinnon; Ron Paul as US President; realisation that temperature may drive CO2, not the other way round; reform of the fractional banking system; a realisation that left-right politics are facades of a centralised one party system; the release of Nikola Tesla technology; a cessation of my countrys seemingly eternal policy of violent international interventionism; a widening of philosophical parameters beyond Creationism Darwinian Evolution; and silverware for Arsene Wenger. Otherwise, rock easy! Trends forecaster Gerald Celente says rock easy! I use his mantra: unencumbered by political dogma and conventional wisdom, and a Turkish Ottoman saying later used by Ataturk: Yurtta Baris, Dunyada Baris Peace at Home, Peace in the World. I tend to avoid referencing David Icke because peoples predisposed positions are often alerted before well-disposed evaluation. As a boy I fantasised playing for English football team Arsenal. BBC1 flagship sports programme Grandstand featured Football Focus presented by Saint and Greavsie; more fun and even dangerous in the 1980s than mainstream friendly, Grandstand stand-in host Mr. Nice David Icke. David was the regular TV presenter for increasingly popular sport, snooker, and almost annoyingly inoffensive compared to the dangerous players Alex Hurricane Higgins and Jimmy Whirlwind White. In 1991 I saw David go nuts in his tracksuit on The Wogan Show. Cuddly Irish TV chat show host Terry Wogan belittled Icke for going nuts. It was uncomfortable viewing and I empathised with Icke. Later I considered buying a book, drawn to differing photos on the back cover of David; portrayals before and after his transformation. I decided to leave it; Icke was a passing interest, not a must buy. I took up painting and went from Riyadh Saudi to Midland Texas to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, landing and staying in Istanbul for ten years plus. I tried persuading Turkish authorities to implement my Bosphorus Rainbow Bridge project: painting the 7 colours of peace upon the 7 underside grey panels of the Bosphorus Bridge. The Prime Ministers office denied the project citing concern about creating a terrorist target, foreign parties painting their Turkish bridge and the San Francisco rainbow gay imagery. Id naively seen the rainbow as a peace symbol all religions and cultures could embrace. My portraits of Turkeys secular founder Ataturk may have helped to deter the Islamic leaning AKP government. Ataturk, like Churchill, is a hero for many about whom some questions are taboo. The massive vibrations of a deadly earthquake shook me awake in 1999. In 2001, on 9/10, my Istanbul studio windows shook to the vibration of a suicide bomber in Taksim Square. The next day I watched 9/11 unfold live on cable TV and a reporter in Pennsylvania described a 30ft x 40ft hole with nothing in it. Compared to the scar at Lockerbie, it was unlikely a plane crash. The Pentagon attack did not infer a jet airliner, and a third building fell in free-fall time just like the first two; just like the controlled explosions of unwanted structures by that chap on BBC1s childrens programme Blue Peter. In 2002 I undertook a commission to portray Colonel Gadhafi for a Turkish construction company commemorating a 30-year working relationship with Libya. I only met Libyan diplomatic representatives who supplied official photographs from which to work. I was told the UK was viewing Gadhafi in friendly terms so my portrait would not be an issue. My windows shook again in 2003 as terrorists hit the Istanbul British Consulate. I held an art exhibition in the newly built consulate in 2005 before attending my exhibition in seaside resort Bodrum. A friend lent me Ickes The Biggest Secret and I sat by a swimming pool captivated by a different and fascinating perspective to the world Id grown up in. Back in Istanbul painting and listening to BBC Radio 4 via the Internet, Tory politician Edwina Curry suggested BNP leader Nick Griffin and historian David Irving should not be permitted to debate at the Oxford Union. Griffin is best left to speak freely and create his own demise, but I put down my paint to google Irving; WWII concentration camps; typhus epidemics; the practicalities of gassing and disposing of numerous bodies; how corpses were piled up by liberating forces to be photographed. A few years later I read The Story of a Polish Exile by my new friend Witold Kasicki, a Pole who survived 5 concentration camps because he volunteered to man the typhus block. In my last letter to him I wondered why his book, although including horrendous and unfathomable detail of cruelty, had not mentioned gas chambers. He died last year a day after calling me to postpone our arranged lunch. My impression is he was so affected by the mass culling, the methods were almost immaterial. I saw David Icke at Brixton Academy in 2008. During his introduction he referred to his arthritic hands; that the word cripple was just a word and to get over it. I had used the rudest and most offensive English words to create my abstract Rude Word Painting in Istanbul, inspired by the Turkish PM complaining of insulting journalism and cartoons. The rudest Turkish words to me were merely inoffensive audio-visual vibration. I used words that may prevent this article being acceptable for a writing competition: cunt, fuck, nigger, paki. As I type my thoughts turn to Dr. Masaru Emotos work with word vibration and water crystals. In 2009 at a shopping centre in Bury St. Edmunds, where The Charter of Liberties was signed 1214, I displayed the painting at 9am and by 3pm had to remove it because of complaints. The only person informed of my going to see David Icke was a barrister friend in his final weeks battling cancer. He called me during the last coffee break of the show and I had to leave before Davids final hour; the hour where he lifts the atmosphere after the gloom. I really wanted that optimistic last hour. I have painted portrayals of Common Sense author, Thomas Paine, born of my nursery school town Thetford. The theory making most common sense to me with regards to being a human being is Davids: infinite conscious having an experience; high frequency love and lower frequency fear. Adhering to this daily is difficult as I frequently lose my rag. I have attended too many cancer-related funerals. I have shared information about the health industry to friends and family, yet conventional wisdoms prevail. The BBC rattle on oblivious to the ever-increasing numbers accessing alternative sources of information. I came to realise copyright and patents are crucial in curbing the sharing of information. I now supply NPP images for free and my greeting card inserts state: Copyright is a debilitating redundant concept. Recently my hairdresser talked of ADHD syndrome and medication diagnosed to her 6-year-old son. I mentioned Health Ranger Mike Adams. During my next appointment an Internet connected mobile was thrust under my nose showing www.naturalnews.com as she declared, All mums should know this stuff! My hairdresser only phones to confirm appointments. Then one day I returned a message, nothing to do with hair. She simply said, Why didnt you tell me about the Illuminati and the New World Order? Today, even Ron Paul apparently accepts the official 9/11 story, yet the mainstream label him dangerous. David Icke is perceived by some as being on another planet altogether. The choice of love over fear is the crux of life. I urge you to use the Net while possible and enable love to reign over the fear of asking questions.

"Jet lag â€” feeling groggy during the day and awake come bedtime â€” is undoubtedly a nuisance, and travelers who get hit with it are not rare. â€œJet lag affects most people who travel to different time zones, even if that difference is only an hour or two,â€ said Dr. Charles Czeisler, the director of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital in Boston.There are strategies to make the transition to that new time less painful. Dr. Czeisler shares his top ones below:If youâ€™re heading someplace that has only a few hoursâ€™ time difference compared with where you live, Dr. Czeisler suggested shifting your body clock closer to the new time zone a few days before your trip. If you live in New York, for example, and are going to Los Angeles, which is three hours behind, go to bed an hour later and sleep in an hour later than you usually do, if possible. â€œEven easing into your destination one-third of the way beforehand will make it easier for you to adjust when youâ€™re there,â€ he said.Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain that facilitates our ability to sleep, especially if you need to go to bed earlier than you usually do. Dr. Czeisler said that a melatonin supplement can help quiet the brain and silence the signal that you need to be awake; he recommended taking it in your new time zone a half-hour or so before you want to go to sleep. He said that Pure Encapsulations, a company with which he has no affiliation, makes a pharmaceutical grade, high-quality version; melatonin is also sold at drugstores and health food stores.Exposing yourself to as much natural light as possible in your new time zone helps reset your biological clock to that destination, Dr. Czeisler said. If you canâ€™t get outside, artificial light, such as a brightly lit room, also helps as long as itâ€™s daytime, not night. He also suggested trying Entrain, a free app that makes lighting recommendations to help you adjust to your new destination. And, despite what travelers may have heard about avoiding naps if theyâ€™re trying to beat jet lag, he said that a 30-minute to hourlong snooze is actually beneficial because it gives you enough energy to stay awake through the day but still get a good nightâ€™s rest.What you eat and drink matters when it comes to jet lag. Beware if you ply yourself with caffeinated drinks throughout the day in an attempt to stay awake; Dr. Czeisler said that half the amount of caffeine you consume stays in your system for six to nine hours and can interfere with a good nightâ€™s rest. Other dietary sleep disrupters include alcohol and rich meals too close to bedtime.",1
"Angry Conservative MPs confronted the justice secretary, Liz Truss, at a private meeting on Monday night, voicing concerns over her handling of the criticism of high court judges in the article 50 court case. Tory MPs at the meeting, many with backgrounds as senior lawyers, are understood to have told the lord chancellor there was â€œhuge concernâ€ among colleagues at the slowness of her response to the attacks on Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls Sir Terence Etherton and Lord Justice Sales in newspapers and by politicians. Last week, the high court said the government did not have the authority to trigger article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, without putting it before parliament.  The judgment, which the government is appealing against at the supreme court, sparked a backlash on front pages, including the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, which called the judges â€œenemies of the peopleâ€. MPs said Truss had failed to quell the febrile atmosphere of public debate around the ruling, and should have made it publicly clear that the judgment was not about the Brexit argument but about the procedure for leaving.  â€œHer job is to defend judiciary from attack, and while she is not required to attack the Daily Mail she should have disassociated the government from their attacks,â€ one Conservative source said. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, was also criticised by fellow Tories at the meeting, though he did not attend, for saying last Thursday the ruling was â€œan attempt to frustrate the will of the British peopleâ€. Conservative MPs told Truss they believed Javidâ€™s appearance on BBC1â€™s Question Time had been a â€œlow momentâ€ for the government and that Truss should have been prepared in advance for attacks and willing to defend an independent judiciary. The lord chancellor told MPs her initial silence on the issue had been an attempt to cool tempers, rather than pour oil on the fire, but said the department would be faster in responding when the case got to the supreme court in December.  However, MPs were said to have been less than impressed when Truss said the job of defending the judiciary should fall to the lord chief justice in the first instance, an argument described by one source as â€œfeebleâ€ give that Lord Thomas was one of those under attack for giving the judgment. Tory MPs said Trussâ€™s explanations at the meeting had been inadequate. She was â€œnot in charge on the issuesâ€, one said.  Pressure is mounting on Truss from legal quarters. The renowned human rights lawyer Philippe Sands called for her to resign, saying she had lost the confidence of the profession and it could not be recovered. Sands, who has acted in cases involving the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone â€“ including at the international criminal court â€“ tweeted:   #LizTruss should resign, or be removed. #ruleoflaw must be protected. Confidence in her is shot, will not recover.  https://t.co/abYcuaSB61â€” Philippe Sands (@philippesands) November 8, 2016  On Monday, 17 QCs from prominent chambers 1 Crown Office Row wrote to Truss saying they were dismayed by her â€œinadequateâ€ defence of the high court judges.  After entreaties over the weekend, Truss said the independence of the judiciary was â€œthe foundation upon which our rule of law is builtâ€ but stopped short of condemning the attacks. In their letter, the silks said the statement â€œfailed to spell out in clear terms that the judges in question had simply been ruling on the dispute, had not been motivated by bias and to accuse them of trying to thwart the will of the people was dangerously to misrepresent what they had doneâ€.  17 silks from @1CrownOfficeRow tell @trussliz they are ""dismayed"" by her ""inadequate defence"" of the Brexit judges. pic.twitter.com/RRPxIBMiG1â€” Joshua Rozenberg (@JoshuaRozenberg) November 7, 2016  The former justice secretary Michael Gove, a leading member of the leave campaign, wrote on Twitter on Monday night that the three judges were â€œbrilliant, thoughtful, wise and decent men â€“ their judgment deserves respectâ€. He said he found much of the judgment â€œpersuasiveâ€ and although he â€œdidnâ€™t agree with elements of their reasoning Iâ€™d personally treat the judgment of three brilliant men with respectâ€. Freedom of the press should also be respected, Gove said. â€œA raucous, vigorous, press is just as much a guarantor of freedom as our independent judiciary,â€ he said. â€œPeople who object to what they damn as irrational tabloid media often deploy visceral and instinctive arguments themselves.â€",1
"Walking through a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of Portland, Ore., in July, Kelly Reichardt noticed a group of teenage street punks. They had dreadlocks and dogs and dirty clothing emblazoned with hand-drawn anarchy symbols. Reichardt faltered for a moment, and then crossed the street. She told me that she suspected one of them had begun shooting up on a garage roof next door to the house where she was staying. â€œMy instinct is to call the cops,â€ she said. â€œBut then itâ€™s like, God, whose side am I on?â€The scene would have played differently in one of Reichardtâ€™s films. Her moment of hesitation would have been barely perceptible; her lines would have been cut. The camera might have lingered sympathetically on the pockmarked face of one teenager before panning back to Reichardtâ€™s. Her reaction would have been inscrutable.Reichardt, who is 52, has made a career of silence and suggestion â€” of casting an attentive but unobtrusive gaze on people who can never quite seem to win. She is interested, she says, in characters â€œwho donâ€™t have a net, who if you sneezed on them, their world would fall apart.â€Like her films, Reichardt is short and lean and soft-spoken. It is difficult not to feel brash in her company. You want to whisper, and whatever intimacy is established seems tenuous. The vibration of a cellphone is enough to break the spell. We met at the small cottage Reichardt rents for a few months each year in Portland, where she socializes with a small coterie of artists, including her occasional writing partner, the Oregon-based novelist Jon Raymond, and Todd Haynes, who has executive-produced five of her six feature films. Reichardt regularly shoots her films in this corner of the country, using the backdrop of Oregonâ€™s conifer forests, high deserts and shabby strip malls to portray lives led on societyâ€™s outer rim. â€œThe characters are just sort of an extension of the landscape theyâ€™re in,â€ Reichardt said, after we sat down to lunch at the kind of self-conscious cafe that would never appear in one of her movies. â€œTheyâ€™re a product of the places theyâ€™re from and their troubles â€” their everyday troubles.â€Whether set on a cooperative farm (â€œNight Moves,â€ a 2013 eco-terrorism thriller) or in a desolate parking lot (â€œWendy and Lucy,â€ a recession-era character study), her films are all, in their own strange way, westerns. The shots are rife with the genreâ€™s archetypal motifs â€” horses, trains, buttes â€” and the quiet stories she tells, of lonesome, seminomadic searchers struggling to maintain dignity in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, fill the screen as forcefully as any film that John Wayne was ever in. Reichardtâ€™s protagonists tend not to be men, however, but emotionally inarticulate women, whose problems the supposedly civilizing force of frontier justice never proves strong enough to fix.While a lone man can be a hero â€” readily and right from the start â€” a lone woman is cause for concern. Despite their painterly settings and near-silent soundscapes, Reichardtâ€™s films are animated by a sustained unease. The viewer anticipates a threat that could but never quite does progress to a state of emergency. A car crash produces no injuries. A nocturnal encounter with intoxicated homeless men does not result in sexual violence. An old man gives every indication he could die at any moment but does not. The menace is durational and transforms the audience into participants in a kind of endurance art. Itâ€™s the low-grade but unrelenting sense of hazard that is a womanâ€™s experience of merely moving through the world, an anxiety so quiet and constant it can be confused for nothing more than atmosphere.The daughter of a crime-scene detective and an undercover narcotics agent, Reichardt grew up in Miami, which she alternately describes as â€œsurvivors playing canasta,â€ a â€œcultural voidâ€ and â€œthe place, from the third grade on, I fantasized about getting out of.â€ Thurston Moore, of Sonic Youth, who was born in the same hospital as Reichardt and spent his early years in South Miami, once told her that he saw an ad in a local paper that read, â€œIf anyoneâ€™s ever heard of the Clash, please call me.â€ â€œThat,â€ Reichardt said, â€œis the best description of the Miami I grew up in.â€She dropped out of high school after 11th grade, worked in a clog shop for a while and a record store for a little longer and eventually caught a ride to Boston in the middle of winter. â€œI had never seen snow before, and I was there in my little Miami clothes,â€ Reichardt said. â€œIn my mind it was a blizzard, but it was probably just snowing.â€ She arrived at a friendâ€™s empty apartment, settled in and, as she recalls, â€œwas sitting there pondering how my new life was going to goâ€ when she heard a knock at the door. â€œThere were two people there,â€ Reichardt says. â€œNow I understand the get-up, but there they were in Salvation Army granny clothes and combat boots and he had his shaved head.â€ She had never seen such people and couldnâ€™t even tell how old they were. â€œThey were like, â€˜We live across the street and our freezerâ€™s broken and we have some hamburger meat in that fridge.â€™ And I looked, and indeed there was hamburger meat in the fridge. And they said, â€˜So you want to come have spaghetti with us?â€™â€‰â€The dinner was Reichardtâ€™s first introduction to any sort of life outside the mainstream. She began sleeping on her neighborsâ€™ couches, attending their parties. She took night classes to get access to equipment, which she used to film their projects; the films, in turn, became her application to art school. After graduating from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, she moved to New York City and, after a few years, began writing her first feature film, â€œRiver of Grass.â€Reichardt once described â€œRiver of Grass,â€ which was met with positive if not career-catalyzing reviews, as â€œa road movie without the road, a love story without the love and a crime story without the crime.â€ It was released in 1994, a full 12 years before her next movie. She spent half that time couch-surfing, including a few months in Hollywood, trying and failing to get something made in a place that, as she realizes now, required skills like pitching and schmoozing that she didnâ€™t even knew existed. â€œI came back to New York thinking: This is torturous. What do I even like about this?â€ she said. â€œThe answer, it turned out, was: I like holding my camera. I like shooting and thinking about frames.â€She went back to making short Super 8 films, mostly shot outside. â€œThey were really not good,â€ she insists. Still, one made it to the Venice Film Festival. â€œOf course my producer and I werenâ€™t invited to any of the parties,â€ she said. â€œSo we sat on the riverbank and watched these parties that were happening on boats. It really was an epiphany. I thought, This is exactly where I want to be: not at the party but on the bank of a river, with my friend, looking on at it.â€She used $30,000 she inherited from a great-aunt to make â€œOld Joy,â€ a misanthropic buddy film shot on 16-millimeter and co-starring the indie-rock musician Will Oldham. Since then, Reichardt has worked continuously, releasing a new film every two or three years. For her, this pace is an act of self-preservation. â€œIâ€™m not great with the production of real life â€” the car, the insurance, the dentist â€” all those things that seem to mount up if you donâ€™t have a project and become the meat of your day,â€ she told me.If Reichardtâ€™s ineffectual years in Hollywood taught her anything, it was the value of identifying undesirable ways of working and living â€” and then developing the confidence to avoid them. She lives alone in a rent-stabilized apartment in New York and maintains a normal personâ€™s sense of money. â€œItâ€™s still like a house,â€ she says when the budgets for her pared-down productions come up. In exchange for working outside the system, she has earned the privilege of final cut. â€œNobody comes into my editing room, ever,â€ she told me. â€œArt by committee is a really bad idea.â€â€œCertain Women,â€ her latest film and arguably the most precise expression of Reichardtâ€™s vision to date, is a triptych based on three short stories by the Montana-raised author Maile Meloy. It follows a small-town lawyer (Laura Dern) trying fruitlessly to convince a man injured on a contracting job that making a claim against his former employer would be hopeless; an unhappily married couple (Michelle Williams plays the wife) in the midst of harvesting sandstone for a weekend house; and a recent law-school graduate (Kristen Stewart) who becomes the object of fixation for a reclusive female ranch hand. Though each restrained vignette is connected by only a blink-and-you-miss-it narrative delicacy, an active loneliness unites the characters, whose inner desolation seems at least in part a reaction to the barren winter plains of southern Montana. Like so many of Reichardtâ€™s protagonists, each of the women is a â€œfigure of repose,â€ to quote Robert Warshowâ€™s famous essay â€œThe Westernerâ€ â€” people whose â€œmelancholy comes from the â€˜simpleâ€™ recognition that life is unavoidably serious.â€Williams, who has acted in three of Reichardtâ€™s films, characterizes the directorâ€™s work as â€œ38 things buried under the semblance of nothing.â€ When she first read the script for â€œCertain Women,â€ she thought there were pages missing. â€œAs an actor, you cling to things like back story, what your character says and does,â€ Williams told me. â€œBut silent communication is actually how we experience our lives. ... We go along all day without saying anything that you can really pin something to, nothing someone could point to and say, â€˜Hey, it hurt me when you said this.â€™â€‰â€Like the Dardenne brothers or the Italian Neo-Realists or a mud-encrusted Robert Altman on the set of â€œMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,â€ Reichardt is devoted to showing the texture of genuine hardship. She is preoccupied with the cruelty of inattention and the rote motions that make up a personâ€™s day. Where does someone who lives in a car brush her teeth each morning? What does someone working two jobs look like, move like at the end of the day, knowing sheâ€™s about to get up and do it all again?Reichardt, as if in solidarity with her characters, is herself made uncomfortable by comfort. She embraces a grueling production process that mimics the precarious existences she shows on-screen. When critics and cinephiles lament the demise of low-budget filmmaking, theyâ€™re almost always talking about projects that cost many times more than Reichardtâ€™s. â€œCertain Women,â€ which was made for around $2 million, is by far her most expensive film to date. Her 2006 movie, â€œOld Joy,â€ cost $100,000; â€œWendy and Lucy,â€ from 2008, $300,000.â€œYou can romanticize it â€” and maybe it is adding something â€” but it also just means that Iâ€™m not getting paid, and Iâ€™m in my 50s,â€ she jokes. Gus Van Sant likes to remind Reichardt that with more money come new problems. â€œIâ€™m sure itâ€™s absolutely true,â€ she acknowledges, â€œbut I think Iâ€™d like to try some of those other problems.â€Of her many inhospitable sets, the one for â€œMeekâ€™s Cutoff,â€ a re-enactment of an ill-fated Oregon Trail journey and Reichardtâ€™s only â€œtrueâ€ western, was the most hostile. There were rattlesnakes and tornado-speed winds; it was 110 degrees during the day and 20 degrees at night. Actors came down with heatstroke and hypothermia. â€œGoogle is not research,â€ she said. â€œResearch is a lived thing.â€Reichardt elicits unparalleled performances in part by creating conditions under which actors cannot act. Frequent appearances by animals force improvisational gestures, as does bad weather on set, which is incorporated into scenes instead of avoided through expensive scheduling changes. It was well below freezing and gray when â€œCertain Womenâ€ began filming in Montana last spring, and by lunch the camera crew was in tears. Nobody but the actors and a limited crew were present â€” no studio executives, no onlookers. â€œNo one really wants to sit out in 18-degree weather and see what youâ€™re doing,â€ Reichardt explained. â€œTheyâ€™re hard places to get to by design, and it makes for an insular, private world.â€Last October, five months after filming had wrapped, I visited Reichardt at Skywalker Ranch, George Lucasâ€™s Arcadian 6,000-acre estate in Northern California, where various rooms and buildings â€” sound-editing suites, mixing stages, screening rooms â€” are routinely rented out by Hollywood postproduction crews.With the state-of-the-art technology and all the parking lots hidden from sight, the grapevine-trellised campus looked like a wellness spa or the location of a rigorously hashtagged six-figure wedding. Guests can swim, ride bikes, drink proprietary wine and eat gourmet meals prepared with vegetables grown on the premises. She was grateful for it, but the entire setup agitated her. It was too nice.Reichardt was there to get through a few efficient days in the studio with Kent Sparling, a sound designer with whom she worked on â€œNight Moves.â€ The two had already clocked nearly 100 hours side by side in foam-padded rooms, and their rapport was one of affectionate bickering. Like everyone else who comes into contact with Reichardt, Sparling â€” who is known for being exacting about his work and whose credits include films as diverse as â€œLost in Translationâ€ and â€œThe Simpsons Movieâ€ â€” seemed almost careless by comparison.The rural Montana that Reichardt captured on camera six months earlier now needed to sound as subtly correct as it looked. The bird calls were a source of unyielding tension. In an attempt to muffle out a line of dialogue spoken by a child, Sparling suggested inserting some chirps. â€œWeâ€™ve got a little peeper bird,â€ he offered, while scanning his list of audio files. Reichardt asked, â€œDoes that exist in Montana?â€ Sparling groaned. â€œAre we really going there?â€ Reichardt nodded. He played the clip and then said, â€œI think the peeperâ€™s too quiet anyway.â€ They went on like this: Sparling playing warblers, Reichardt looking up online the ones she liked to see if they were regionally and seasonally appropriate. A pheasant was proposed, as was a grouse. â€œWeâ€™re near a river, so maybe thereâ€™s a wood duck?â€ Reichardt wondered aloud. Sparling played her a wood duck. The quack was boisterous, almost funny. Reichardt, perhaps the only person in the world who could find a bird call gauche, yelped. â€œGod, no, not the duck!â€Sparling, impatient, suggested a bird from Florida, and Reichardt laughed. â€œWhat was the first conversation I ever had with you?â€ she asked. â€œIt was, â€˜Do you care about birds?â€™ Wasnâ€™t that the first question I ever asked when I met you? Iâ€™m pretty sure it was.â€Slowly, slowly throughout the morning they finessed their way through seconds of footage. Tinkering with the rumble of a truck engine, Reichardt instructed: â€œLetâ€™s embrace it but not embellish it.â€ While editing a conversation that takes place inside a car, she argued with Sparling about how best to retain both the dialogue and the sounds of the road. â€œLetâ€™s get the air and the wind and the trees and the gravel and the tires and just forget about what they say,â€ Sparling joked punishingly. â€œYou want your unbuttered toast buttered!â€ Reichardt smiled, and said, â€œWell, yeah, a little bit.â€They continued. Noises that Reichardt turned down or cut out included a single wind chime, a barely audible breeze, the rustling of a tent. The already-quiet scene grew quieter, stiller. At one point, the sound of a tarp wrinkling was inappropriately amplified. No moviegoer would notice it, but that wasnâ€™t the point. Despite initial adjustments, the whirring was still apparent. Reichardt asked Sparling to lower the levels again; he did, but it wasnâ€™t enough. Reichardt looked despondent. In a signal of forfeit, she sighed, shrugged and said, â€œMaybe the world is just too loud.â€",1

"Anonymous Launches Massive Attack on Turkey for Supporting ISIS 40,000 Sites Down in 7 DaysBy Jay Syrmopoulos Anonymous Operations (@AnonOpsSE) December 21, 2015 According to a report by RT: The DDoS attack (measured in gigabits per second, or plainly how much traffic is being sent to a site) on Turkish DNS servers reached 40 Gbps, quite enough to shut down altogether any domain. The attack began on December 14, and came to a halt only a week later, on December 21. Turkish media alleged that 400,000 .tr domains were forced offline. The affected websites were able to return online only after Turkeys leading National Response Center for Cyber Events cut off all incoming international traffic to the .tr websites, thus shutting down national internet borders, completely and denying anybody outside the country access to Turkish websites, Anonymous pointed out. This mass cyber-attack is known to be the biggest so far with the intensity of slowing down the websites, ODT Computer Engineering Professor Attila zgit said as cited by Hurriyet Daily News. The hacktivists claim the attack on Turkey was conducted within the framework of the counterterrorist cyber operation #OpISIS. The basic message behind the attack is that Turkeys woes with the internet are set to repeat unless Ankara revises its policies towards Islamic extremists. The hacktivist group released a video announcing the campaign against the Turkish government. Greetings citizens of the world, We are Anonymous. As many of you have heard, Turkey is supporting Daesh by buying oil from them, and hospitalizing their fighters. We wont accept that Erdogan, the leader of Turkey, will help ISIS any longer. The news media has already stated that Turkeys Internet has been the victim of massive DDOS attacks. This lead Turkey to shut down its internet borders and deny anybody outside the country to access Turkish websites. Dear government of Turkey, If you dont stop supporting ISIS, we will continue attacking your internet , your ROOT DNS , your banks and take your government sites down. After the root dns we will start to hit your airports, military assets and private state connections. We will destroy your critical banking infrastructure Stop this insanity now Turkey. Your fate is in your own hands. We Are Anonymous We Are Legion We Do Not Forgive We do not forget. Expect us. #OpISIS #OpTurkey After the downing of a Russian Su-24 bomber, Russia turned the spotlight onto Turkey and their shady dealing with ISIS as part of a continued campaign to further destabilize Syria, with the goal of toppling the government of Bashar al-Assad. The Russian Defense Ministry has released satellite images showing convoys of ISIS oil tankers, trucking routes and has directly accused the son of Turkish President Erdogan of being one of the primary actors in facilitating the Islamic States illegal oil business in Turkey. Anonymous has previously targeted the Islamic State in numerous operations against the extremist group and has made clear that their assault upon the terrorist groups and its allies will continue.

"There was nothing that could have been done to save Phillip Hughes after he was hit in the neck by a ball as he batted in a Sheffield Shield match two years ago, a coronial inquest into his death has heard. The 25-year-old former Test batsman, on the verge of a recall to the national side, was struck by a bouncer from the New South Wales paceman Sean Abbott as he batted for South Australia on the afternoon of 25 November 2014. In footage of the delivery played before the state coroner Michael Barnes yesterday, Hughes attempts to hook the ball but misses and is struck on the left side of his neck. In the aftermath, he leans forward with his hands on his knees, before collapsing forward without making any attempt to break his fall. Hughes never recovered consciousness and died two days later at St Vincentâ€™s hospital.   Related: Phillip Hughes, like fellow Australian Archie Jackson, will stay forever young | Russell Jackson   Prof Brian Owler, a neurosurgeon and the former head of the Australian Medical Association, reviewed the injury that led to Hughesâ€™s death, as well as the postmortem results, and concluded: â€œNo intervention, no matter how early, that could have been performed to avoid his death.â€ Owler said the medical treatment Hughes received was â€œtimely and appropriateâ€. Hughes suffered a vertebral artery dissection leading to a subarachnoid haemorrhage that occurred after the ball struck him in the neck. He was wearing a helmet at the time but the blow to his unprotected neck forced his head to move violently in relation to his neck, causing the dissection and a massive haemorrhage of blood into his brain. A Cricket Australia review found the helmet Hughes was wearing did not meet newly introduced British safety standards but that the newer helmet would not have saved him. The weeklong coronial inquest will consider whether any protective equipment â€“ including the â€œStemGuardâ€ neck protector additions to helmets since introduced and widely worn â€“ might contribute to preventing such injuries. Hughesâ€™s family â€“ his parents, Greg and Virginia, and his siblings, Jason and Megan â€“ were at the opening morning of the coronial inquest. Speaking outside Sydneyâ€™s Downing Centre court complex, Hughesâ€™s former manager James Henderson asked that the family be given privacy. â€œThis is going to be a very, very, very difficult week for Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re hoping that perhaps there will be a positive come out of Phillipâ€™s death as we go through this next five days inside the coronerâ€™s court.â€ Barnes offered his condolences to Hughesâ€™s family, saying the 25-year-old was â€œmuch more than a fabulous cricketerâ€. â€œHe was, before anything else, a son and a brother.â€ Barnes said the purpose of the inquest was not to lay blame for Hughesâ€™s death. â€œQuite clearly the death was a terrible accident but that doesnâ€™t mean cricket canâ€™t be made safer.â€ The inquest will investigate the specific cause and manner of Hughesâ€™s death, as well as its broader context. In statements to the coroner, the umpires said play at the SCG that day had been in good spirits and that there was no noticeable aggression or acts of sledging that had concerned officials. No bowlers had been warned for dangerous or unfair bowling, or for continually bowling short at batsmen. The inquest heard that while it was a tactic to bowl short to Hughes, it was not done with the aim of injuring him but in order to get him out.   Related: Australia to push for 'concussion substitutes' following report into Phillip Hughes death   In a statement, the NSW captain Brad Haddin, who was wicket-keeping when Hughes was struck, said â€œat lunch, there was a discussion about the plan get Phil to nick the ball by moving his feetâ€ but that the tactic was â€œmore of a field placement change than a bowling changeâ€. A longtime state and Australian teammate of Hughesâ€™s, Haddin appeared before the inquest on Monday, saying the incident had been terrible to watch. â€œIt was like something Iâ€™ve never, ever witnessed before in my life when he fell down,â€ he said. â€œIt was the noise that he let out, the groan, and the way that he fell straight down motionless without trying to break his fall.â€  Simon Taufel, the former international umpire and umpiring expert, reviewed the entire dayâ€™s play and, in a report, said there had been 23 bouncers bowled for the afternoon, an unremarkable number. He said the umpires had firm control of the match and he witnessed nothing untoward in the leadup to Hughesâ€™s death. â€œPhillip was mostly playing the short deliveries with relative ease, either ducking underneath them, or hitting them for runs.â€ Players also reported in statements that they did not believe there was any targeting of Hughes by bowlers that day, that there was no warning from the umpires about short-pitched bowling and no recollection of specific sledging targeted at Hughes. The inquest heard from witness Detective Senior Constable Jay Tonkin that he had been told by Hughesâ€™s brother Jason that the NSW fast bowler Doug Bollinger had allegedly threatened Hughes and his batting partner Tom Cooper, saying: â€œIâ€™m going to kill you.â€ Tonkin said he had been told by Jason Hughes (who was not playing in the match) that Bollinger had directed the comment towards both batsman during the dayâ€™s play. â€œJason informed me that heâ€™d been told that,â€ Tonkin said, telling the inquest that Jason Hughes learned of the alleged comments two days later. But none of the players on the field that day remember those words being said. Under cross-examination, Haddin was asked about Bollingerâ€™s alleged remark. â€œI didnâ€™t hear anything,â€ he said. Bollinger himself took the stand and denied having threatened or sledged Hughes. â€œI know I didnâ€™t sledge Phil on that day,â€ he said. He said there was no specific plan to bowl short to Hughes, but that short-pitched bowling was a legitimate tactic to dismiss batsmen. â€œYou can bowl two bouncers an over and thatâ€™s how I bowl.â€ The inquest will also address the ambulance response time and protocols for medical emergencies during Sheffield Shield games. The ambulance was delayed in reaching Hughes because of confusion over where at the SCG the ambulance should attend. In May, Cricket Australia released an independent report into the batmanâ€™s death that recommended helmets be made mandatory for batsman in first-class matches facing medium or fast bowing, and for fielders close to the pitch. In that review, the Australian Bar Association president, David Curtain SC, found Hughes received appropriate medical attention after being struck until the ambulance arrived. The helmet Hughes was wearing that day met Australian standards but not the latest British standard. However, the newer model helmet would not have saved Hughes, Curtain found.",1
"Theresa May has declined to make any extra commitments on receiving child refugees affected by the demolition of the Calais refugee camp, after the French president, FranÃ§ois Hollande, rang her to ask for the Britain to consider its â€œmoral dutyâ€. Downing Street said the UK has already taken a â€œconsiderable number of unaccompanied minorsâ€, and several hundred more children and young people would be arriving in the coming weeks. The government has taken about 274 child refugees this month, mostly those with family ties to the UK under the Dublin regulation. David Cameron also promised earlier this year to take an unspecified number of vulnerable child refugees from France, Greece and Italy after coming under pressure to accept an amendment to the law from the Labour peer Alfred Dubs, who was rescued in the second world war Kindertransport evacuation. But May is still facing calls from French politicians, some British MPs and charities to speed up its processes and take more unaccompanied minors who had been living in the Calais camp but are now being transferred across France. Hollande revealed on Saturday that he had pressed May to take Britainâ€™s fair share of the 1,500 asylum-seeking children left in Calais who are due to be been dispersed to reception centres throughout his country.   Related: Calais: French and British officials keep passing the buck to the very end   He spoke to May to ensure that British officials would â€œaccompany these minors to these centres and would play their part in subsequently welcoming them to the United Kingdomâ€. â€œTheir transfer to Britain is urgent,â€ he added. â€œWe ask you to take your responsibilities and assume your moral duty by immediately organising their arrival.â€ It is understood the phone call between Hollande and May centred on practical steps required to process the childrenâ€™s claims after they have been relocated to specialist reception centres. But sources said the prime minister did not make any new commitments to France that the UK would take in more child refugees, saying it was already taking action in accordance with the Dublin regulation and Dubs amendment. A No 10 spokesman said:â€œWe are firmly committed to working with the French to safeguard and protect children who remain in Calais â€“ and that includes transferring eligible children to the UK safely and as soon as possible. â€œWe have already transferred a considerable number of unaccompanied minors to the UK so far this year, and as the home secretary told parliament this week, several hundred more children and young people will be brought to the UK in the coming days and weeks.â€    Migrants arrive to attend the final service at a makeshift church in what remains of the Calais camp. Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP   The dismantling of the Calais camp began last week and is expected to be complete by the end of Monday. A final service at a makeshift church in the camp took place on Sunday, attended by a small number of refugees and migrants who have not been transferred to reception centres across France. By the weekend, around 5,000 people had so far been evacuated. A 1,500 remaining unaccompanied minors were housed in a camp made from shipping containers, before they are transferred to reception centres around France. The announcement dismayed charities, which warned the dispersal policy could mean that many children might attempt to run away from the authorities out of fear. UK Home Office officials had expected to process the childrenâ€™s applications in Calais. However, a source told the Guardian on Saturday that â€œthe French have pulled the plugâ€ on the scheme.",1
"At least 27 Houthi-led Shiite rebels were killed and dozens of others were wounded in the ongoing clashes with pro-government tribesmen in northern Yemen, the Interior Ministry said late Monday. The ministry said on its website that the clashes erupted several days ago between northern rebels and Al-Jalha tribe, which is loyal to the government, in Monabih district in the northern province of Saada. 'The fighting is still ongoing,' said the ministry, adding that 'there was no available casualty report about tribesmen and the cause behind the clashes has not yet known.' Yemen has witnessed sporadic battles since 2004 between government troops and rebels. The government has been accusing the rebels of seeking to re-establish the clerical rule overthrown by the 1962 revolution that created the Yemeni republic. On Aug. 26, the Yemeni government and Shiite rebels signed an agreement in Doha to cement a February fragile ceasefire in northern Yemen. On Feb. 11, the government and Shiite rebels struck a truce deal to end a six- year sporadic conflict. Both sides, however, repeatedly trade accusations of breaching the truce which still holds so far. ",1
"Many conservatives believe that the Republican Party needs an overhaul.â€œIâ€™m not saying someone shouldnâ€™t blow up the Republican Party. Iâ€™m saying that that someone shouldnâ€™t be an unprincipled imposter,â€ David Harsanyi wrote last month in The Federalist, an arch conservative publication.The impulse to blow the whole thing up has been out there for a while, but politicians whose skill we may have underestimated were able to hold the Republican coalition together. Whatever else you say about him, Mitt Romney won more than 60 million votes in 2012.But this yearâ€™s campaign is the culmination of a shift in the composition of the Republican electorate that has been underway for some time.Tom Davis, who served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 1999 to 2003, argued in an interview that the Republican Party has been losing voters among â€œwhites elites in Northern suburbsâ€ while gaining ground in the heartland, from Appalachia to struggling towns and counties like Fall River, Mass., Atkinson County, Ga., and Macon County, Tennessee, where Donald Trump recently won primary contests by huge margins.â€œAfter the Bush administration,â€ Davis said, â€œwith two unpopular wars and a financial meltdown, there was nothing left, the party was a shell. They destroyed it.â€By the standards of contemporary ideological conviction, Davis, now the rector of George Mason University, is a moderate Republican.Tony Fabrizio, a Republican campaign strategist, is well to Davisâ€™s right, but he has a complementary analysis:This intraparty rift between the more traditional Republican voters who favor free trade and international goals and the ascendant protectionist and nationalist wing â€œhas fomented what we are seeing today with Trump,â€ Fabrizio said.The Republican Party, as it was, has gone into retreat even as it struggles to maintain control. The steady abandonment of norms and standards â€” the pro forma observance of which was once considered essential to the political process â€” has reinforced this development.In National Review, Andrew McCarthy argues that cultural rot has infected the Republican electorate:McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney, continued:Tom Davis similarly noted that the shift of the Republican base to more working class white communities has changed the cultural character of the Republican electorate. Republican voters are now more â€œguttural,â€ as Davis put it, more comfortable with Trumpâ€™s boastful, violent rhetoric and less connected to the cosmopolitan, modulated language of suburbia.The deterioration of popular culture is a fact of life, as anyone who watches television knows. Politicians, of necessity, treat the electorate in much the same way corporations view the marketplace: failure to meet the customerâ€™s needs, desires and values is a sure path to political suicide or corporate bankruptcy.To the degree that Trump represents a substantial and growing sector of the Republican electorate, his success so far is the natural result of the primary process, not a corruption of it.Some conservatives have trouble accepting this. â€œTrumpâ€™s brawling, blustery, mean-spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right,â€ Michael Medved, the conservative talk show host, wrote in National Review in January:In an email, Jonah Goldberg, a senior editor at National Review and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, expressed his concerns.On one hand,At the same time, Goldberg notes, a lot of the blame for the emergence of Trump lies with party elites who have failed to respond to issues raised by younger, reform-minded conservatives:Trumpâ€™s direct appeal to racial and ethnic resentment â€“ of Hispanics and Muslims, for now â€“ has made him the most disruptive force in presidential politics since the emergence of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace, more than anyone else, amplified the salience of race in American politics, which led to the abandonment of the Democratic Party by white Southerners and spurred a Republican realignment of the region.â€œYou could make a case that the politics of rage has gone from George Wallace, morphed into Nixon and the southern states strategy, then Gingrich and his merry band, into Fox News/Limbaugh/Tea Party Republicans,â€ Larry Oâ€™Brien III (a son of Lawrence Francis â€œLarryâ€ Oâ€™Brien, who was John F. Kennedyâ€™s chief political strategist) wrote me, addingJack Shafer, writing for Politico, also points to the parallel between Wallace and Trump:While Wallace used race to force a major restructuring of both the Democratic and Republican Parties, Trumpâ€™s populism is driving a wedge into the heart of the Republican Party.â€œThe alliance of the business wing of the G.O.P. and the working-class wing is already fractured,â€ Heather Richardson, a professor of history at Boston College, emailed in response to my inquiry:Still, in political terms, the question is: Does Donald Trump represent a legitimate expression of the peopleâ€™s will? Is his rise a manifestation of justifiable resentment among less privileged whites at their neglect by higher caste Republican leaders?Dean Baker, a liberal economist, contends in an email that the Trump phenomenon opens future â€œopportunities for a new populist politics. The big question,â€ Baker writes,Trumpâ€™s nativist appeal will strengthen the anti-immigrant wing of the Republican Party. This success will mute the call of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to seek votes from the growing Hispanic population.Regardless of the final outcome, Trump has proven that the traditional Republican Party has lost influence, so much so that a demonstrably duplicitous public figure, a man seemingly without conscience, can take the lead and hold it at least into March.Trumpâ€™s liabilities were put on full display before the 16.9 million viewers who watched the March 3 debate in Detroit, the most revealing (if least enlightening) confrontation of the campaign.Despite that, Trump easily won the Michigan primary on Tuesday, a key test of the candidatesâ€™ strength in the rust belt. He won an outright majority in Mississippi and increased his lead in the delegate count overall.Trump had already revealed the vulnerability of both the Republican Party and the conservative movement, institutions that together claimed the presidency in seven of the ten elections between 1968 and 2004.He has reconvened the largely passive â€œsilent majorityâ€ â€” the Reagan Democrats and the angry white men of past elections â€” and turned it into a renegade force that has rebelled against its marginal status in the Republican coalition.How the Republican Party deals with this insurgency will define much of American political life this year, on into 2018 and 2020. If by popular acclaim Trump is legitimated, the party will be forced to acquiesce. But looked at another way, it no longer matters whether Trump wins the Republican nomination. His emotional baggage and his political doctrine have already had an incalculable impact, and it is not a force for good.",1

"Big Oils Secret: They Support Global Warming PolicyBoom Criteria A Delaware corporation founded in 2005 to commercialize technology developed by The Energy and Resources Institute (known as TERI). [] Our vision is to be the leader in bio-technology solutions to the global oil and gas industry and service provider of choiceto both independent and major oil and gas producers. Our mission is delivering state of the art bio-technology solutions to improve and increaserecovery from mature oil wells and to solve complex problems associated with the production of oil, gas and water. Its important to note that TERI, now unanimously known as The Energy and Resources Institute was once actually named Tata Energy and Resources Institute,but Ill get back to that later. Glori Oil also later changed its name to Glori Energy, Inc. and recently appointed a certain Robert Button as President of Glori Holdings, a subsidiary of Glori Energy. Heres how they announced it in their March 2012 newsletter: Button will apply his extensive industry experience in support of Glori strategy to acquire end-of-life and abandoned oil fields for increased oil production. Button is a senior Exploration and Production (EP) business leader with 30 years of U.S. and international industry experience with Amoco and BP. Button joins Glori from BP where he served in an executive role and was accountable for the Organization Capability of the EP Segment Operations,Health-Safety-Environment, and Engineering disciplines. (Source) Many might think that such environmentally unfriendly Big Oil company must be lobbying and spreading liesin the anthropogenic global warming/climate change debate to protect its dirty business. Well, yes thats true, but heres the fun part (youre going to love this). The Business Week link above lists a certain Dr. Rajendra Kumar Pachauri as founder of Glori Oil/Glori Energy, Inc.,but for some reason, his name doesnt appear on glorienergy.com (although it did appear on glorioil.com not just as founder but as head of the company). Well, Dr. Rajendra Kumar Pachauri is none other than the Nobel Peace Prize-winning chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), that was established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme since 2002. This is the same IPCC that insists that fossil fuels and human CO2 emissions are driving the warming of global climate; that the science is settled,that solar cycles have no or very little impact on our climate, that the earth and its inhabitants are doomed if we dont tax and tradeI mean curb our carbon emissions. Thanks to archive.org (AKA the Wayback Machine) one can read his biography on the now disappeared Glory Oil website andfind that, apart from being the Director-General of TERI (someone forgot to amend its name there, funnily enough,its the only place on the website where its still referred to as Tata Energy Research Institute). He also served on numerous boards and committees including Director of the Oil and Natural Gas Company of India;Director of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited; President of the Asian Energy Institute; Member of the Panel of Eminent Persons on Power;Ministry of Power; Member of the Advisory Board on Energy; Government of India reporting to the Prime Minister of India; Member,National Environmental Council, Government of India under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister of India; Member of the Oil IndustryRestructuring Group, for the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India; Member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India;and a Member of the International Advisory Board of Toyota Motors etc(Source) So yes, the preeminent scientist whose job is to create and promote the green agendas policy/scientific consensus as headof the IPCC is a Big Oil insider. No, Im not arguing that fossil fuels arent a plague to the environment, quite the contrary. But I am convinced that the settled science according to which human carbon emissions drive our climate is junk-sciencethat serves a very pernicious, highly profitable and sinister agenda put in place by the very banking/oil/military/drugs cartelsthat plague the planet and 99.99% of its inhabitants. CO2 isnt a threat to the environment. Things like depleteduranium bombs used in every US/UK/UN/NATO neo-colonial/imperialist wars, nuclear reactor meltdowns, and GMO pesticide-soaked crops are the real threats. Anyone who really cares about the environment should focus their efforts on educating their fellow humans about the real issues andnot be part of the engineered smoke screen/distraction that is the human CO2 emissions-induced Global Warming/Climate Change scam.

"Scientists have developed a new roadside test for cocaine in an effort to improve driver safety. The device is an improvement on current tests, avoiding the problem of false positives, and can offer insights into how much of the drug drivers have taken. â€œDrug-driving is an increasing problem,â€ said Melanie Bailey of the University of Surrey and co-author of the research published in the journal Analytical Methods. â€œWe want to try to improve safety on the roads and this is one way to do that because we will be able to monitor a larger number of people without wasting their time by getting false positive results.â€  Nearly 8,000 people were arrested for drug-driving in England and Wales between March 2015 and April 2016, with cocaine and cannabis among the illegal drugs tested for. While roadside tests for cocaine already exist in the form of antibody-based kits the approach, researchers say, cannot reveal how much cocaine a driver has taken and can give false results.  â€œThe antibody binds to the drug that is of interest and then you get the positive result, but the problem is that antibody can also bind to things that are not cocaine, so you can get a false positive signal - for example, certain kinds of antibiotics,â€ said Bailey. â€œIn about 5% of cases you will get a test result that is positive when actually the person hasnâ€™t taken cocaine.â€ The new device uses a dual approach to analyse a swab of saliva from the driverâ€™s mouth. The chemicals in the sample are separated using chromatography - the same technique that can be use to separate ink with blotting paper and water. The mass of the chemicals and their fragments are then analysed to reveal whether cocaine is present. The device, says Bailey, is based on a robust laboratory technique that has been miniaturised to produce the portable roadside test.  While Bailey adds that each new device costs upwards of Â£30,000, compared to Â£5 per current roadside test, she is confident that the approach will prove cost-effective in the long term. â€œOver a year, even, the number of tests that you would carry out would pay for itself,â€ she said.",1

"When people complain to me about a poll, itâ€™s usually because they think the demographics are wrong. The pollsters polled too many white people, commenters might say, or too many old people. Or perhaps the sample of Hispanic voters doesnâ€™t seem quite Democratic enough.Most of the time, these comments are wrong.The biggest reason? Theyâ€™re comparing pre-election polls to exit polls. And it doesnâ€™t work.Thereâ€™s always uncertainty about the composition of the electorate in a poll, so donâ€™t judge too harshly. And the sources we can use to compare â€” like the exit polls taken right after an election and the census â€” arenâ€™t perfect, either. Thereâ€™s genuine uncertainty about the composition of the electorate in many battleground states, and nationally.The good news is that thereâ€™s no need to sweat small differences. It just doesnâ€™t matter as much as you might guess. A pretty significant three-percentage-point difference on the number of white people nationally, for instance, might mean only the difference between a tie and a two-point lead for Mrs. Clinton.When the differences between the census or voter registration file and a poll get even bigger, thatâ€™s when you can start to make some more definitive claims about whether a poll is â€œwrong.â€ The differences become big enough to be sure that the poll is off, and big enough to make a difference in the result.These big gaps are likelier to happen with lower-quality polls. Here are some of the ways it can happen:â–  They arenâ€™t weighting by age or race. This is a bit more common than you might guess, and Iâ€™d be willing to dismiss a poll on that basis.This Franklin and Marshall poll of Pennsylvania from March is a good example. It wasnâ€™t weighted by age or race at all, and the effect is obvious: 93 percent of voters were white, and just 2 percent were ages 18-24.â–  The â€œsampling frame,â€ the people who can be sampled in the poll, is too narrow. A lot of pollsters call only voters who have participated in some number of the last elections. That helps save money, but it means they get an older and whiter sample. Some pollsters then go a step further, and screen for likely voters on top of a sample thatâ€™s already likely to vote.A good example is a SurveyUSA poll of North Carolina voters that found that just 13 percent of voters were black (23 percent is probably about right), and just 8 percent of voters were ages 18 to 34 (even though the sample is supposed to be weighted for age).â–  Bad weighting targets. Pollsters could be trying to get the composition of the electorate right, but they might just have the wrong idea. This is especially common when pollsters are trying to match the likely electorate rather than a better-known target like registered voters or the adult population. It was an issue for the pollster Rasmussen in 2012, and PPP in 2014 polls (they seem to be doing a better job recently in this regard, at least to my eye). It sometimes can happen when pollsters use old targets, like weighting to the 2010 census when the country has since become more diverse.â–  Trimming weights. This is hard to identify, but it can hurt even a seemingly high-quality pollster. Here, the pollster says itâ€™s weighting by race or age and itâ€™s aiming at a reasonable target that is representative of the electorate, but the pollsterâ€™s sample is nonetheless falling short, even after weighting. This happens when a pollster wonâ€™t weight an individual respondent by more than a certain amount â€” say four times.Thereâ€™s a sensible reason you wouldnâ€™t want to weight a single respondent by too much. Imagine an extreme example, in which a poll had only one Latino voter. A pollster could weight him 100 times over. But is it a good idea to allow this one person to represent 10 percent of your poll? Of course not.So thereâ€™s a trade-off: If you trim your weights too much â€” that is, refuse to weight any individual respondent by more than a certain amount â€” you might end up falling far short of your targets. This was one of Gallupâ€™s biggest problems in 2012, as uncovered by Mark Blumenthal, now head of election polling for SurveyMonkey.â–  Noisy likely-voter screens. Even if a pollster is doing everything right, the likely-voter screen might still yield a sample of the electorate thatâ€™s just not right. There are a lot of reasons this can happen. You can see some examples from 2014 in Georgia.Exit polls, taken after people have voted, capture a younger, better-educated and more diverse electorate than the census or voter registration files show. Almost all of the polls are weighted to match either census or voter files results. In interviews with political scientists, pollsters and campaign data scientists, I found no one who believed the exit polls were more accurate than the census or voter files.The whiter electorate in the census and voter file has big consequences for the way we should read pre-election polls. It implies that the polls do a much better job of representing the electorate than many analysts have argued.Most of the polls done right now question registered voters, and most high-quality polls are accurately representing the demographic makeup of the electorate.The same polls didnâ€™t always do so well among likely voters. Screening for likely voters is as much an art as a science. There are a lot of questionable practices involved, like asking whether voters know their precinct or using capricious cutoffs in which pollsters decide what percentage of their sample are likely voters and which are not. The biggest problem, though, is largely out of the hands of the pollsters: Nonwhite â€” and especially black â€” voters simply havenâ€™t been as likely to tell pollsters that theyâ€™re going to vote.When the polls start screening out unlikely voters â€” generally in August or around Labor Day â€” weâ€™ll need to question whether respondents are honestly reporting their intentions. Itâ€™s possible that likely-voter screens will again suggest a whiter electorate than the one that shows up at the voting booths in November. But thereâ€™s no reason to assume that likely-voter screens will inevitably understate nonwhite turnout, simply because they did in 2012.Relying on the somewhat more diverse, better-educated and younger electorate suggested by exit polling has a surprising consequence: The results for subgroups in the exit polls wind up more conservative than subgroups in pre-election polls.Itâ€™s a matter of basic arithmetic: If the electorate is as white as the census implies, then the Democrats must do better, somewhere, to make up for the reality of the smaller number of nonwhite and young voters than is suggested by exit polls. Or if you prefer to think of it in reverse: The exit poll results donâ€™t add up to the result if the electorate is whiter than in the exit polls.The pre-election polls indicate that Democrats probably do better among white voters than the exit polls suggest. According to our estimates, President Obama won 41 percent of white voters in 2012, compared with the 39 percent indicated in the exit polls. The gap is even bigger in several battleground states.Polls of registered voters have an additional problem: Young white voters represent a larger share of registered voters than of the electorate, so Democrats tend to do better among registered than actual white voters.Add it all up, and the result is that pre-election polls always show Democrats doing better among white voters than the exit polls do. One thing Iâ€™d note: The polls seemed to capture Mr. Obamaâ€™s strength among nonwhite voters just fine.So how do you make sense of this conflicting polling data? One option is to use our estimates, which are based on pre-election polls and census data. This is a pretty good comparison for likely-voter surveys.",1
" Almost 150 civilians have been killed in a week of intense violence in the besieged eastern half of Aleppo, activists said as violence continued to grip Syriaâ€™s former industrial capital. The latest casualty figures cap two months of unprecedented violence in Syriaâ€™s largest city. More than 800 people have been killed since forces loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad announced a campaign to crush the opposition in the rebel-held eastern districts. â€œThis ferocious campaign is a war of extermination,â€ said a doctor in eastern Aleppo, who was wounded earlier this month in an airstrike. â€œEverything is a target, whether human or tree or rock. Everything is being exterminated with the collusion of the United Nations. They all see and hear, but they will not answer, and they cannot stop this war machine.â€ He added: â€œWe have nobody but God,.â€   Related: In Aleppo's destroyed hospitals the dead lie with the living   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation, said on Tuesday that 141 civilians, including 18 children, had been killed in the last week of violence.  Moscow intervened last year in the conflict to shore up the Assad regime. Observers had predicted that the renewed assault on Aleppo would begin with the highly publicised arrival a week ago of an aircraft carrier belonging to Russia off the Syrian coast. Those fears have been realised one week into the vaunted campaign, with relentless aerial bombardment that has reduced to rubble civilian homes and left the rebel-held east without any functioning hospitals for a quarter of a million people, including almost 100,000 children, according to UN estimates, who are still living there. The city has been besieged since July. â€œI am more or less at my witsâ€™ end,â€ said Stephen Oâ€™Brien, the UNâ€™s top humanitarian official, at a security council briefing on Monday, in a blistering condemnation of the international communityâ€™s paralysis. â€œShame on us all for not acting to stop the annihilation of eastern Aleppo and its people and much of the rest of Syria too.â€  The Observatory said on Tuesday that 834 civilians, including 176 children, had been killed over the past two months.   Related: Five maps that show how the net closed on eastern Aleppo   Casualty figures over the past three days have been difficult to come by because they are usually tracked by local hospitals, which have been put out of service by bombing.  Aleppo has been divided since 2012, with the west under government control and the east held by rebels. Its fate has long been seen as a bellwether for the momentum of the Syrian war, and forces loyal to Assad hope to deal a fatal blow to the rebellion by seizing the last major urban stronghold under opposition control. Loyalist forces include thousands of Iranian-backed militias along with a contingent of Syrian government troops who have so far made limited incursions into the rebel-held east. That battle will likely result in numerous casualties and intense urban combat that would leave the neighbourhoods still standing in ruins.",1

"America Has Unofficially Declared War on the HomelessBy Josie Wales The Homelessness San Diego Facebook page recently posted a video of city workers conducting an encampment sweep that was recorded by homeless advocate Michael McConnell. According to CW6, the city says it routinely posts clean-up notices downtown as part of its regular weekly abatement schedule. The Denver Police Department released a statement last Thursday evening defending police officers caught on video taking blankets, sleeping bags, and tents from homeless people and issuing some citations. Freezing temperatures didnt stop the cold-hearted cops from confiscating the items as evidence of the violations. The video taken by a bystander went viral after being shared by the ACLU of Colorados Facebook page. It was swiftly followed up by an open letter to Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, Denver City Council, and city officials. The letter, which expresses horror at the willingness of the local government officials to endanger the lives of the homeless, demands that the City immediately (1) direct its police officers to cease confiscation of blankets and other survival gear possessed by people experiencing homelessness, (2) suspend enforcement of the Denver Urban Camping Ban through the winter months, using that time to explore alternative approaches to homelessness that do not criminalize people for having nowhere they can afford to live and (3) end the coordinated sweeps of people experiencing homelessness, whether they are conducted through police, public works, private security, all of the above, or any other means. This is not the first time Colorado authorities have come under fire for their brutal treatment of the homeless. In February of this year, Denver Law School released a report called Too High A Price: What Criminalizing Homelessness Costs Colorado, which examined the economic and social cost of the anti-homeless laws. According to the paper, Laws that criminalize panhandling, begging, camping, sitting or lying in public, and vagrancy target and disproportionately impact homeless residents for activities they must perform in the course of daily living. Los Angelesdeployed an entire task force to crack down on homeless people, imposing their own encampment sweeps in September. The ironically named Homeless Outreach and Proactive Engagement teams are supposed to help reduce the number of people living on the street, but they appear to be doing nothing more than turning those who are less fortunate into criminals. The ACLU declared a small victory over the summer when it successfully defended the rights of a man charged with trespassing after trying to gain access to emergency shelter. According to Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts: Todays landmark, unanimous ruling has affirmed, e.in the state high courts own words that our law does not permit the punishment of the homeless simply for being homeless. Anti-homeless laws are cruel, unconstitutional, and create more hardship for those targeted, making it harder for them to get back on their feet. It is unthinkable to believe that stealing blankets and clothing from people living on the street is justifiable by any legislation, and it is terrifying to see law enforcement follow orders to do so without blinking an eye.

If you spot a typo, please email the error and name of the article to edits@theantimedia.org. There is no lawful authority, and it matters not who gave/gives those orders. All law enforcement is REQUIRED to take and keep an Oath to support and defend the US Constitution. THAT is their, and all who serve within our governments, highest contract, and it comes before the orders of superiors and before the duties of the position occupied. They are required to refuse any unlawful order, and that includes *color of law. They are required to know the difference by knowing at the very least the Bil of Rights. So those actions could be charged as *terrorism, quite possibly **treason. *Blacks Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, defines Color of Law as: The appearance or semblance, without the substance, of legal right. Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only The requirement for all Federal and State Civil officers to give their solemn and binding Oath is established in Article VI, Section 1, Clause 4. For the crime to be Treason, Cramer v. United States (1945), the Supreme Court held that a specific intent adherence to the enemy, and therefore to harm the United Statesis necessary, rather than the simple When their actions are against the people who have committed no crime, but are homeless mostly due to what those in government did such as Free Trade, etc makes what is being done to them not only despicable, but criminal in action. Just following orders and/or just doing their jobs does not exclude them from crimes against the American people, *treason, **terrorism. (Read the Nuremberg Trials, at least the Opening Statement by Roberts) *Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States, and it provides that: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. So what are the three important elements that are necessary for an offense to constitute treason: it requires an obligation of allegiance to the legal order, and intent and action to violate that obligation. They are bound by Oath and allegiance here in the USA to the US Constitution, and to their own states Constitution Not to any superior, or to any job. Norton v. Shelby County The Court said: An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties. It is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed. Brookfield Construction Company V. Stewart 284 F Sup. 94: An officer who acts in violation of the constitution ceases to represent the government. 18 USC 241 Conspiracy against rights: If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, Sherar v. Cullen, 481 F. 946: There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of his exercise of Constitutional rights. U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 380 U.S. 436 (1966): Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule-making or legislation which would abrogate them. Gross v. State of Illinois, 312 F 2d 257; (1963): State Judges, as well as federal, have the responsibility to respect and protect persons from violations of federal constitutional rights. Great Article, and helps me to believe that there are more young people who will stand against this official lawlessness. As an aside, there are several Court Rulings from the US Supreme Court, including rulings from the 1980s, which state clearly that a law or rule that contradicts the US Constitution and Bill of Rights is fundamentally void as a Matter of Law. This trend of increasing laws by the hundreds is a smokescreen. I find it perplexing that if a government cant provide 100% employment or sustainable welfare payments for those they cant employ that they would sink to the levels of callous inhumanity that I read in articles coming out of what many once regarded as the greatest country on Earth (at least by its own citizens). Whilst my own country Australia has turned into an unpleasant Police State of late at least the government provides welfare (A$439/week for a single adult) as well as a house or apartment for 25% of ones income. I suppose when a government spends over 50% of its revenue on defense (actually offense!) not much is left for the people its supposed to serve. The notion of Police shooting peoples dogs for the mere offense of barking coupled with the disturbing details of this story clearly demonstrate America is finished (sadly)! Well Said. I follow whats going on in Australia quite closely, and I have been stunned by how closely Australia followed the globalism of the US during the past 15 years, although it is not well known in the US that Australia ensures basic living allowances for its people, thus, preventing the kind of poverty endemic in the US. This is all indicative of the fascist, globalist take over of the planet cleverly orchestrated by our friends in the Federal Reserve. Australia has little choice but to remain friends with America and put up or shut up. The C.I.A has already overthrown one of our Governments (Whitlam 1975) however few Australians realise Americas involvement as Governor General Kerr was made the fall-guy at the time. Contrary to the blatant propaganda spewed out by the mainstream press many people here as in America have supported Trump in the hope he can at least put the brakes on a process which seems hell-bent on dragging us into WW3. All it will take is another large false-flag that will be blamed on the Zionists current favourite enemy. The next 6 months will tell however I remain pessimistic. Yes, and I guess I should address this to Che. The US Cabal owns some out of this world, valuable property at the heart of Australia, so, yes, it owns Australia. Am I right that Whitlam made a few critical comments about the Viet Nam debacle? Or, was it the presence of the US in the Philippines? Whitlam also wanted to close down Pine Gap, the secretive American base in the center of Australia which no Australian is allowed to set foot it. Since the debacle 41 years ago (I was 10 but remember it well) no Australian Priminister has dared to oppose the will of the United States. Despite this, most Australians have an overwhelmingly positive view of America largely a consequence of the entertainment industry and the similarities between our two cultures. I grew up believing that America saved our country from Japanese invasion in WW2 and as such deserved our respect however access to the internet has enabled me to understand why we were at war with Japan in the first place. Yes, propaganda really works! You know about Pine Gap, but how many other Aussies do? The Treaty that is the basis of that facility is secret, and a lot of money has been paid to keep it that way. Whitlam was one in a billion. Interesting how its perfectly fine for police to steal blankets, coats, and other personal property from the poor, working class, but they would ever do the same with a rich person, because private property is sacred. Yes, the New World is the Great Social Experiment of the overlords. Think CHEAP LABOR. All great wealth has been derived from the exploitation of slavery and cheap labor. ",0
"A List Of 97 Taxes Americans Pay Every YearMichael Snyder As you will see below, there are dozens of other taxes that Americans pay every year. Of course not everyone pays all of these taxes, but without a doubt we are all being taxed into oblivion. It is like death by a thousand paper cuts. Our politicians have become extremely creative in finding ways to extract money from all of us, and most Americans dont even realize what is being done to them. By the time it is all said and done, a significant portion of the population ends up paying more than half of what they earn to the government. That is fundamentally wrong, but nothing will be done about it until people start demanding change. The following is a list of 97 taxes Americans pay every year #1 Air Transportation Taxes (just look at how much you were charged the last time you flew) #32 Import Taxes Yet despite all of this oppressive taxation, our local governments, our state governments and our federal government are all absolutely drowning in debt. When the federal income tax was originally introduced a little more than 100 years ago, most Americans were taxed at a rate of only 1 percent. But once they get their feet in the door, the social planners always want more. Since that time, tax rates have gone much higher and the tax code has exploded in size. Why do we have to have the most convoluted tax system in the history of the planet? Why cant things be simpler? In a previous article entitled 24 Outrageous Facts About Taxes In The United States That Will Blow Your Mind, I listed a number of reasons why our federal income tax system has become a complete and utter abomination that is entirely out of control 1 The U.S. tax code is now 3.8 million words long. If you took all of William Shakespeares works and collected them together, the entire collection would only be about 900,000 words long. 2 According to the National Taxpayers Union, U.S. taxpayers spend more than 7.6 billion hours complying with federal tax requirements. Imagine what our society would look like if all that time was spent on more economically profitable activities. 3 75 years ago, the instructions for Form 1040 were two pages long. Today, they are 189 pages long. 4 There have been 4,428 changes to the tax code over the last decade. It is incredibly costly to change tax software, tax manuals and tax instruction booklets for all of those changes. 5 According to the National Taxpayers Union, the IRS currently has 1,999 different publications, forms, and instruction sheets that you can download from the IRS website. 6 Our tax system has become so complicated that it is almost impossible to file your taxes correctly. For example, back in 1998 Money Magazine had 46 different tax professionals complete a tax return for a hypothetical household. All 46 of them came up with a different result. 7 In 2009, PC World had five of the most popular tax preparation software websites prepare a tax return for a hypothetical household. All five of them came up with a different result. 8 The IRS spends $2.45 for every $100 that it collects in taxes. 9 According to The Tax Foundation, the average American has to work until April 17th just to pay federal, state, and local taxes. Back in 1900, Tax Freedom Day came on January 22nd. 10 When the U.S. government first implemented a personal income tax back in 1913, the vast majority of the population paid a rate of just 1 percent, and the highest marginal tax rate was just 7 percent. If it was up to me, I would abolish the income tax and shut the IRS down. But neither major political party in the United States is even willing to consider such a thing. So the monstrous system that we have created will continue to get even bigger and even more complicated. We are literally being taxed into oblivion, and most Americans dont even seem to care.

"A profit-booking spree dislodged the bullish reign at Pakistan's Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) Tuesday as the market witnessed resistance at above 10,550 levels, however, the main index managed to sustain the 10,400 levels. The benchmark KSE 100-Index fell by 28.02 points to close at 10, 419.82 levels, the KSE 30-Index declined by 45.43 points to conclude at 10,661.88 levels, whereas the KSE All Share Index dipped by 18.20 points to finish the day at 7,334.49 levels. Despite a negative closing, market volumes showed improved numbers as a trading of 244.706 million shares was recorded which is 22.185 million shares more when compared with Monday's turnovers of 222.521 million shares. The market started off the day amid positive numbers once again and recorded bullish activities for some time where foreign investors continued with their buying spree that helped the main index to go past 10,500 levels. Owing to the initial burst, the main index found its intraday high of 10,554.52 levels within the first couple of hours. However, as has been the case, the second part of the trading day once again came with a selling spree that erased all of the gains and the key index hit the lowest level of the day of 10,419.82 levels during the final minutes of the session. Syed Faran Rizvi, Director SMH Financial Solution told Xinhua that the market resistance level for Tuesday was 10,482 levels and once the market crossed that barrier there were always chances of profit-taking. He further stated that the short-term traders are expected to book profits in the near term. Advising the investors, Syed Faran Rizvi said that the investors should sell on strength as this decision would give them maximum benefits at current levels. The market will receive support at the level of 10,225, he added. Lotte Pakistan PTA Limited emerged as the top traded scrip of the day with a trading of 62,934 million shares, followed by Azgard Nine Limited, National Bank of Pakistan, Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited. In the broader market, a total of 421 scrips traded hands during the course of the day where losers outnumbered gainers with a ratio of 215 to 184 whereas prices of 22 other issues remained unchanged. Khalid Saifuddin of Safely Invest informed Xinhua that for the last couple of trading sessions, it has been specifically noticed that local investors are following the suit of the foreign investors, who net invested 3,941,128 U.S. dollars Monday, which is of course very healthy for the market. However, the biggest question that arises in the minds is why the local traders do not believe in this rally and why are mutual funds still selling? While commenting on the external factors on the market proceedings, Khalid Saifuddin said that investors are looking for some positive measures from the finance ministry to balance the incoming budget against the rising inflation. The new wave of violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may disturb new entrants into the market, he added. He said that the market still has some positive triggers in store where the incoming International Monetary Fund's fifth tranche holds the key while the re- launch of the leverage product at Pakistan's premier bourse would also help rev up the investor confidence.

"Police Using Biometrics on Americans Without Consent in Unaccountable DatabaseBy Aaron Dykes Populations there not only face the possibility of becoming a statistical civilian casualty, but are processed and tagged like cattle as well. Now, that paradigm is coming home to roost as spy agencies like the NSA have long planned. Biometrics are designed for use in mass populations here in America and throughout the Western world, not just war-torn locales. According to the NY Times: Facial recognition software, which American military and intelligence agencies used for years in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify potential terrorists, is being eagerly adopted by dozens of police departments around the country to pursue drug dealers, prostitutes and other conventional criminal suspects. But because it is being used with few guidelines and with little oversight or public disclosure, it is raising questions of privacy and concerns about potential misuse. The potential for abuse is obvious. Already, the database is saddled by millions of people who are not criminals and have not been charged with any crime which experts claim is reducing its effectiveness. There is about a 20% rate of false-positives hardly encouraging: It is not as if there is the identification of a specific crime problem; they are simply collecting a lot of information that could impact a lot of completely innocent people, said Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former F.B.I. agent. The New York Times interviewed two people upset about police detaining them on street curbs to take a photo for the biometric database, while also taking such data as cheek-swabbed DNA. They werent arrested, but now they are being watched more closely than people realize, as increasing numbers of cameras and computer systems are beginning to utilize law enforcement biometric databases, potentially recognizing and flagging innocent people everywhere they go, and subjecting them to possible undue suspicion. One case was a retired firefighter who encountered police after he attempted to stop an intruder at his home: Eric Hanson, a retired firefighter [was] stopped by the police after a dispute with a man he said was a prowler, he was ordered to sit on a curb, he said, while officers took his photo with an iPad and ran it through the same facial recognition software. The officers also used a cotton swab to collect a DNA sample from the inside of his cheek. I was thinking, Why are you taking pictures of me, doing this to me? said Mr. Hanson, 58, who has no criminal record. I felt like my identity was being stolen. Im a straight-up, no lie, cheat or steal guy, and I get treated like a criminal. The other was black youth, also with no criminal record, who was stopped and profiled with facial recognition, because police told him he was suspected of being a gang member in a neighborhood threatened by gang violence. Mr. Harvey, 27, remains upset about what happened to him. He said that when he refused to consent to having his picture taken, the officer boasted that he could do so anyway. [] Mr. Harvey, who is African-American, said the San Diego Police had stopped him as a suspected gang member more than 50 times because his neighborhood, Lincoln Park, is among the citys most violent. He said he had been told he was in a gang database, even though he has never been a gang member. Police are currently not required to file reports when they enter individuals into these biometric databases, so it is difficult for privacy advocates or concerned citizens to hold them accountable for policies that are, as of now, unrefined and unchecked. However, the report, focused on the San Diego police, indicates that at least 20,600 attempts were made by the department to identify persons and match them with the database which is sure to grow, and be shared nationwide and globally. But the future already holds a bleak outlook for privacy, largely promising only greater and greater levels of surveillance and control that would not only make the founding fathers roll in their graves, but would give the average person the sense that they are under watch with preemptive suspicion even thought theyve done nothing wrong. Since the FBI is cutting the ribbon on its own biometric tech center, these policies are all but guaranteed to spread to departments throughout the country.

"Attacking Police and Enacting Violence Will Do Nothing to Stop Brutality It Will Make it Far WorseBy Matt Agorist These apparently unprovoked attacks on individuals who were not directly involved in threatening the life of the shooters are a hindrance to the progression of liberty and police accountability. Random acts of violence will only serve to undo what little progress those of us in the peaceful movement have accomplished and,in fact, will reverse it and prevent any future progress. (((terpkristin))) (@terpkristin) July 8, 2016 Violently attacking the government creates victims out of the ones we are trying to expose as criminals. Those who initiate and support such violence will be complicit in creating the hellish police state that will inevitably ensue as a consequence of their actions. It will start a war in which the people are the enemy. We can simply look back to 9-11 as an example of what is to come if this violence continues. Prior to 9-11 the TSA did not exist, indefinite detention did not exist, the NSA did not spy on American citizens, the police werent given armored assault vehicles, and Americans could not be assassinated without trial. We can expect to see peaceful activists rounded up and detained indefinitely. We can expect to see homes raided of individuals who are speaking out against the State. We will see more and more checkpoints, and less and less unmolested travel. If you think that the American people can somehow win in a war against the military industrial complex that the US has built up in the last decade and a half, you are seriously delusional. Your AR-15 will do nothing against thermal imaging predator drones equipped with Raytheons small tactical munitions designed for blowing up single homes. They will not stop the MRAP as it plows through your front door. No matter how you slice it, the most well-armed American citizen is no match for the hundreds of billions spent annually by the US on warfare. No, this battle will not be won with weaponry as the US spends more annually on defense than the next 13 largest militaries in the world, combined. Also, the above scenarios dont take into accountthepublics support. If a group of people rise up and claim to be freedom fighters and they do not have the support of the citizens, well, that revolution was over before it started. If anyone thinks that killing cops and/or praising the death of innocent people will amass public opinion in their favor again, they are seriously delusional. Even if a large group was able to get public support and engage in a war against the government, imagine the horrid reality that would come to pass.The US would literally be a war zone and quickly languish into third world status. As a former Marine, I know that before I woke up to this tyranny, I would have done anything my leaders told me, including initiating force against Americans especially if there were an increase in theprevalence of unprovoked violence against the State like we just witnessed in Dallas. However, I also know firsthand how people can change once presented with the information that frees them from their Statist bonds. Most of these police officers are simply brainwashed into thinking they are doing the right thing. They just need to see their true reflection enough times to realize that they are not. It is up to you and me to provide this reflection. That is why we must win the hearts and minds of the people within the State. We must expose as much of their violence and corruption as we can, for that is what garners support not murder. We must show that those of us who stand against this state corruption are the good guys. We are not some violent group of terrorists who are quick to don the pitchforks and torches and beg for blood. Removal of due process, the initiation of violence, and abuse of power these are tools of the State, not of the peaceful revolution. Those who would take an innocent life to incite change are no different than the mass murdering sociopaths within the government. But police are not innocent, some will say. What are statements such as that one, other than calls to remove due process and act as judge, jury, and executioner, just like the corrupt police? Yes, police uphold a system of immoral laws that lead to the harassment, kidnapping and death of innocent people. But these are mere symptoms of a much larger problem. The police state didnt suddenly pop up overnight. Its a product of society. More accurately, its a symptomof a sick society that we are all complicit in creating. Our only means of changing this sick society is changing ourselves. We have to remove our dependency upon a group of people who use violent coercion to achieve what they refer to as order. When enough of us do this, the police state becomes irrelevant. To quote Butler Shaffer from his eye-opening book,The Wizards of Ozymandias: We will not become free when the state goes away. Rather the state will go away once we are free. Taking an aspirin for a headache only masks the symptom of that headache, it does nothing to eliminate the cause. One cannot eliminate future headaches by constantly taking aspirin, in the same manner that one cannot change a violent State by acting within the rules of that State; violence will only be met with more violence and more support for the State. We must show that policing society does not have to be like this. We must expose the faults of this archaicsystem of using violence to solve every problem that arises. We must show that there are alternatives to this type of policing and these alternatives will eventually make the old system obsolete.This has already begun. We are now witnessing the free market reacting to an incompetent and violent police state by creating alternative means of community security. Apps like Peacekeeper, which connects community members directly to each other to foster community interdependence by empowering community members to protect one another, are popping up as a reaction to police violence and corruption. Organizations like the Threat Management Center in Detroit are popping up in response to police incompetence and negligence, and they are proving to be magnitudes more effective than actual police. The new system is being built and is quickly showing the obsolescence of the old. But here is the kicker all these alternatives go away as long as people keep initiating senseless violence. We can say goodbye to all these positive aspects of society reacting peacefully to the police state. Every act of senseless violence is a step backward in the fight for freedom. Do not mistake this as a call to pacifism. No one is advocating that you lay down and lick the boots of tyrants as they oppress you. Self-defense is a natural right. This is why we see laws popping up like the one in Indiana that legalizes the shooting of police if they enter your home and pose an unjust threat to you and your family. Georgia Sen. Mike Crane is running in the states Republican primary to replace U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland. Any politician seeking office in that very conservative state must pledge their support to cops and authority figures. But Crane, being a strict constitutionalist, believes that no-knock warrants are illegal and unjust. He was even filmed at a town hall meeting noting how shooting at unannounced intruders in your house is just, regardless of the badge. The actions that we are taking now like filming the police, photographing and documenting their corruption and standing up to their immoral rule, are the real catalysts of change; and again, they will all go away if the violence continues. This one photograph from Kent state, showing the murderous nature of the police state did more to incite change than any amount of violence could ever do. The video of Eric Garner did not lead to the indictment of officerPantaleo, but it set off a wave of peaceful resistance like weve never seen. Sports figures, movie stars, newscasters and even lawmakers have rallied together to put an end to this senseless police brutality. The two videos of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were waking Americans up. Now, their tragic deaths are put on the back burner as the nation grieves the senseless murder of the Dallas police officers. If you think that we are losing this battle, however, think again. Police are frequently contacting The Free Thought Project and asking how they can help stop this ridiculous police state, and we are working with them to find new ways. One of the ways is a fund that weve recently set up to help whistleblower officers. There are organizations like LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) that are fighting the odds and standing up to their own peers and seeking peaceful change. There are movements across the country which are forcing police departments to carry their own personal liability insurance.This would stop the unaccountable flow of taxpayer dollars to pay for police misconduct, and hold the officers directly responsible for their actions. We are winning and can beat these tyrants. But if people continue to stoop to the same level of senseless violence and removal of due process as them, we will not only lose, but guarantee that there will never be another opportunity to resist again.

MK-Ultra? in case the author has been sleepingTHE POLICE ARE AT WAR WITH THE PEOPLE. When good cops dont take a stand against bad cops the good cops are going to be in the line of fire just the same as the good Nazis who were just following orders. Agree, seems hopeless. Maybe now its best for all patriot websites and talk shows to shut down and go underground (hunker down) since nothing has really been accomplished since the internet got going with patriot websites, talk radio. Downhill esp. since 9/11. Few if any have awakened in years and nothing really gets done. The bad guys have all the weapons and we will be trampled trying to resist any tyranny. Hiding out and leaving cities best option if possible. Many cannot, for various reasons. Train wreck over a cliff just ahead. Article explains exactly why patriots will utterly fail trying anything which is 21 century weaponry and few alpha males in this country left. Matt Agoristhmmm. For whatever reasons, something makes me question WHY you wrote this article more than what you are saying in it. Could you enlighten us to why you felt the need to push such a message given current state of affairs? To me,it seems he feels the build up of an horrific SWAT like no-holds barred policy of law enforcement, along the lines of the most militant martial law, a Gestapo form of law enforcement, and he is scared to see that become reality. He feels there is only one chance to stop the progression toward martial law, and that is what he is recommending. At the heart of what he is saying is, dont harm or take on the cops, furthering the them versus us mentality that will cause the cops to close ranks and come after every American. How do you know the mind of Matt Agorist? Let him defend his own writing. Let him speak for himself. However, he cannot be bothered with such things while he rummages around on the Internet for some story he can spin up and fling onto a website like this one. Since I actually read his article, and have read similar writings, and as i prefaced my remarks, it seemed to me that he feared the Why dont you try to educate yourself before throwing more hostility, hatred and violence on innocent people. The writer has the same rights you do to put his opinions in writing. You are merely flinging your ignorant opinions on paper. You are merely rummaging around in your uneducated, hateful brain for something to say. Too bad you have nothing worth reading to say. I read the article too. That is your first wrong assumption: that I did not. Got Flaming Medusa spews vile? Free Speech. Freedom. You no like, live elsewhere, blog elsewhere. You add nothing of importance or edification. Just spew. Whats with you? What is wrong with me asking Matt Agorist the question I did and why do you feel you somehow feel a need to detract from that? Ahhh, you too, have an interest in that question and how it is answered, or not answered. What narrative are you supporting? He is applying Sun Tzus dictum. Discourage people from fighting and you can walk all over them. BINGO! Matt Agorist sounds more like statist snake in the grass after reading this surrender-monkey screechfest The two videos of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were waking Americans up. Now, their tragic deaths are put on the back burner as the nation grieves the senseless (?) murder of the Dallas police officers. Hmmm now, that couldnt possibly be the point here? But hold on, I should probably take off the tin-foil hat A lot of important news stories are now on the back burner. Love your sarcasm! Leave the hat on, it is now a badge of courage of those who actually think for themselves. Distractions, Distractions lets be clear about this, they have brought this on themselves, I have seen four videos where the police have stopped a car, and each time the people inside the car had no chance, because the police officer behaved like an hysterical schoolgirl, and he has fired his weapon without any provocation from the victim, I am not trying to blow up how good the British police are, but they are way above the US POLICE, in my opinion the US POLICE are the OFFENDERS and the LAWBREAKERS, PLUS NOW THEY HAVE BECOME THE ENEMY, because if any family of mine was killed any these screaming Banshees I would want to know the reason why, many of the police officers have served in a war zone before joining the police and they have not been cleared for duty, that is why they cant perform like a normal person, because they are already damaged goods. if something has to change it has to be the police force, because they are coming murder and getting away with it, unless the world is going through a reversal where the good guys are inside, and all the bad guys are wearing uniforms. So you dislike veterans.. There are movements across the country which are forcing police departments to carry their own personal liability insurance. This would stop the unaccountable flow of taxpayer dollars to pay for police misconduct, and hold the officers directly responsible for their actions. Just a minute, lets think about this. If ALL the police departments in the U.S. need to take out liability insurance, at the taxpayers' expense, and that insurance is going to cover all of the anticipated settlements for police misconduct, wont that just spread the costs around to taxpayers everywhere? Not to mention factoring in a nice fat profit for the insurance industry? Nice to see someone is thinking! Nice to see at least two people are thinking, Cal and BRtanner. You screen applicants to find those within a narrow range of acceptable intelligence (not too dumb, not too bright), you hire from amongst them a bunch of wannabe legal thugs who believe a badge and gun give them something akin to comic book superpowers over the general populace, you give them military grade weapons and Israeli anti-terrorist style urban warfare training, you show them by incessant Hollywood propaganda and by repeated real-life example that they are in a class of their own, a cadre-in-arms quite literally above the law, and what happens is exactly what youd expect would happen. Now lets give them INSURANCE AGAINST LIABILITY FOR THEIR WRONGFUL ACTIONS? What could possibly go wrong in this scenario? You boys that are taking old Matt Agorist to task over his sniveling article are right on. In addition to the things you have said and in consideration of the current police war on the people, gang bangers killing cops and cops killing gang bangers is behavior that should be encouraged. After all, both are nothing but mafia like criminal gangs in competition with each other to see how much they can steal from the people. The solution to violence is in unity! Unity knows not race, religion or politics; it is intelligence and logic working together to end human insanity. Unity can exist within the Community, Nation, and Humanity; if only, humans whatever side they have found themselves on whether inside or outside of any established and dividing entity stop and focus on what is right with respect for Life and each other! Unity is the person in the street,,, the police officer the priest or imam the diverse natures and colors of our physical garments defined as bodies the Natural Natures and Foundations of Life Itself the caring for each and other. It is time that Unity reawakens and comes back to life within our homes, communities, states or regions, nations and Humanity as a whole.There is no War going on! There is a powerful and occult mind-game going on that is forcing one against other! All of us can win that game by only sto playing it and uniting! I have a problem with part of the statement praising the death of innocent people why shouldnt innocent people be praised? Having spent a couple hours checking all the videos: wrong info put out by chief; 2 snipers on high, the only video of a subject shooting/receiving fire he is on the ground. This guy had no overwatch/sniper covering him. A couple of the other arrested were clearly not involved. One dead shooter, he may have been the only one shooting cops. From on high he should have killed for more as few bystanders were hit (and those may have been hit by cops) and there were plenty of targets as more cops came to area. Several witnesses stated the shooter was at ground level. Looks like most cops hit within first couple minutes. If more than one shooter more cops should have been shot at midway point. I say lone wolf shooter, good shot but not a sniper, no secondary kill zone. I would say non-military shooter, he didnt cut the pie, start out at best position (on high), had no tactical gear, no defense in depth or assault in earnest to get in among the targets. He was committed but not well trained. If you think that the American people can somehow win in a war against the military industrial complex that the US has built up in the last decade and a half, you are seriously delusional. Soooo, hows that victory in Afghanistan against goat farmers armed with World War I rifles doing after 15 years? The Taliban control as much of Afghanistan now as they did before the 2001 invasion, yet here you are spewing this idiocy about the supposed invincibility of the military industrial complex here. They havent won a war since World War II but they will win a war against 100 million armed Americans? F*ck outta here with that nonsense. I get it youve surrendered already and you want company in the camps yeah agreed, article is garbage, they cannot carpet bomb the entire country into compliance We havent won a war in 71 years, you make a good point. Why arent forces using hi tech weapons in the middle east anyway?? Because they are using crap hardware commissioned from no-bid pentagon contracts that dont work on cloudy days (drones) or when its windy and sandy (most everything else). The pentagon has become the biggest collectivist behemoth outside of the old Soviet Union and we all know how THAT monstrosity ended up OR He/she/it is in L.E., spawn of L.E. spouse of L.E. or parent of L.E. Since the dual citizen owned/operated Department of Homeland Security gifted the (true) nuclear rogue state of occupied Palestine with lucrative contracts to train our L.E. in dealing with domestic terrorists violence by them has shot up exponentially; Until everyone realizes that what happened in Dallas and other cities is exactly what the Left wants, Anarchists will continue these atrocities. The Cops arent our enemies, regardless what the media spins. Say what you will, but, 99.9% of Cops are not bad! So how come they cannot control and arrest the 0.1% that you say are bad? What slobbering maroon ! Yahhh, whats up doc ? WTF? Perhaps hes feeling blue today, PJ. Im sure he doesnt ordinarily call people maroon. sorry , I use the same service as BLM and my mail was hacked a few days back? No problem. So far I have been fortunate and evaded the attentions of the unwashed. If you do evil you are evil. 100% of police are bad. They may be IGNORE-ant and they may be STUPID (verified in court,) but that does not change the fact they are BAD PEOPLE for following orders without conscience. Until people understand this simple fact, expect more violence. bullsheet copsucker This is part of the Obama plan to cause widespread violence,shut down the conventions and declare martial law to prevent the election of Donald Trump. Dont fall for the divide and conquer. This is the gov and their agent provocateurs doing this stuff to destabilize the country. This isnt the people murdering these officers Agorist! The people behind this are your former employers. Any evidence to back up your statements? Yes, divide and conquer strategies work and are well used. Ive seen some evidence to support that anti-Trump protesters were paid. Ive seen evidence that counter intelligence (FBI, CIA, NSA) agents were paid to disrupt peaceful protests. Weve had a number of violent confrontations capturing the division and hatred between Americans. Has there been any evidence showing this is paid for, mind controlled or otherwise directed. Please share. Poletitions is where the bullets should be flying. The only real argument I have with this piece is the notion that cops are good. Lol. They are NOT GOOD, they are BAD PEOPLE. If you do evil you are evil. 100% of police are bad. They may be IGNORE-ant and they may be STUPID (verified in court,) but that does not change the fact they are BAD PEOPLE for following orders without conscience. Until people understand this simple fact, expect more violence. Dangerous people then maybe? Anytime someone can order them to cause harm, and theyll follow that order without thinking. Sorry to say, but every time we see these incidents we automatically think of programs like MK-Ultra, etc., and wonder whos driving the bus Is it the FBI, CIA, DIA, ATF, NSA, TSA, Homeland Security, etc.? Well ! why dont we just line up and lick their boots chicken little? We have let this monster get out of control by letting the elected and appointed official get away with violating their oath of office and letting treason slide. Now after Comeys performance , the people hear that the law breakers are just going to run over whomever gets in their way and just damn the Constitution. Sorry folks, you cant have your cake and eat it too. When the time was available and the means to get rid of tyranny, the damned football games and toys kept you preoccupied (Bread and Circuses). The women have been bamboozled through their emotions and the men are castrated shells especially on the Statist side of the isle. Boobus Americanus is getting a rude awakening just as Boobus Europanus is. Since when does six cops equal 560 citizens this year yet ? Herman, you say: Clean out the out of control elements at the Federal and local level and render due penalties to ALL people of position that have knowingly or unknowingly violated the Constitution and/or their oath of office. No exceptions. Later you incidentally mention cats. We get this Throw the Fat Cats out! rhetoric a lot, and those of us who remember our fairy tales are inevitably reminded of the one about the Council of Mice, deciding to put a bell on the Cat, so it cant keep sneaking up and pouncing on them. Unanimous agreement attends this excellent idea, till they get to the sticky part: Who among us is going to bell the Cat? Unfortunately, as it turns out, all present had prior commitments. The story doesnt explicitly say, but Im guessing if the Cat ever does get belled it only happens when a sufficient number of Mice realize for whom the bell actually tolls: every single one of them. this guy that wrote this is a moron. in Iraq and afghan we lost to a bunch of guys in bathrobes and flip flops. this idiot is saying we can change them thru stupid voting or demonstrating . never happen they have to be killed. texas cops got payback for killing all those bikers sniping from rooftops not connected but payback anyway I have seen the enemy and it is the cops. They are there and ever have been there for one reason only: to control the working man and serve the rich. During WW2 the Dutch police co-operated with the occupiers. Do not ask me to respect the working class traitors. Making it worse is the plan. BlackLivesMatter is working for obama to create the chaos he wants to institute unlawful and unconstitutional martial law. The BLM are useful idiots who will experience the same fate once obama is finished using them. this is all planned to bring further destruction upon the usa. kind of a puzzle piece leading up to the solutions which the NWO has prepared. It is definitely a warthe cops have become a huge unionized street gang, and very dangerous to the law abiding public they are supposed to serve and protect.. the cops have become very macho, and obviously watch too much TV and movies of themselves..they do not know the law, probable causeor anythng, its al macho gun play to themmaybe incidents like this, will start them on the path to correcting their behavious. Nope, incidents like Dallas will cause the police to become 1000 times worse, and that is the point of this article. the US POLICE FORCE are already the worlds worse, how much more can they be Gee, Arlene, that just isnt true, and they could be a lot worse, which is what this article is trying to say. If the police believe they are being attacked, and after this mornings new news about Missouri and Georgia attacks on police, things will radically shift in the US, and Im surprised someone as smart as you cant foresee that. What are you talking about ? They are the worse by a mile ! Willful ignorance IS UNETHICAL . Iceland also is pretty peaceful. But just selecting a few countries with low cop killings and listing a few is very uncompelling. Smart, and check out 4 countries in Africa where gays are arrested, torture and imprisoned or just killed by the police for being gay. The list of atrocities goes on and on. The official records for China in 2014 claim only 12 killed by police? Lets look at the last years that United Nations observers were allowed into China to investigate their human rights abuses (2003-2004). In 2003, the Chinese admitted their police killed 460 civilians, but the Chinese engaged in immediate executions, meaning no trial or other due process, to kill another 10,000 people. In fact, the Chinese have admitted that they execute at least 5000 people/year, and as many as 12,000/year. You see, Sarah, whether the civilians are shot down in cold blood, or, arrested and then immediately executed by the State, without any due process or trial, that means that China is killing thousands of its own people every year. That is the reality. Those are the facts and your assertions above are on the level of fraud. The United Nations found that torture in China was widespread, and that hundreds of civilians/year died under torture. Most of the torture is very specific and intended to result in the death of the person being tortured. China has 700 prisons for adults that house over 1.5 million persons, under harsh conditions, and all prisoners must work. More organs for organ transfers originate in China than anywhere else, and most of those are coming from the thousands executed every year. Is it willful ignorance that you have no working knowledge of China and its human rights records? Lets not even touch upon the millions and millions of Chinese murdered during the 10 years after its conversion to Communism under Mao in 1959. Now, the truth about China, so different from what you claim, still doesnt entitle American law enforcement to engage in the abuse and misuse of their official power. We must work to prevent this. First, who benefits from peaceful protests all of a sudden turning bloody? Who benefits by dividing into firmer lines against each other between the people and those who serve the people as law enforcement? What are the things that this action here can cause to further the destruction of the USA, putting it further into a One World Government? If you think the PTB will not murder law enforcement, military, and the general populace to further destroy our nation from within, you are not thinking or paying attention. I will bet when the dust has settled, when it is REALLY investigated that it will be found as the others previous actions such as this have been, committed by paid protestors, paid provocateurs, mercenaries to cause further battle lines to be drawn between the people and law enforcement, between races, between other divisions that can be used against us. I would not be surprised to find out that within the LE community itself will be found some of those who fired upon their own, along with outside assistance. What needs to be done is instead of turning all of us against each other by ever dividing means they can use, we start erasing those lines and defend each other, because when they can no longer get Americans to destroy each other over CAUSED internal divisions be it race, LE vs people, etc then the real fight will come to finish off those of us left. Stand for America, stand for the US Constitution and your state Constitution, stand for Americans whoever you are, whatever position you occupy, because if we do not stand against this, we all will fall. If we do not recognize that this is deliberately brought about to divide and conquer us we have already lost. Looks more like a photo op all the cops behind the wall are concerned about what? Some people mistakenly believe that just because the police have been militarized and the government is at war against the people, that the people can return fire. They are wrong. f you seriously, f you after all they have done. long overdue Lets be clearsince hippies were getting their skulls knocked in in the 60s, we have tried (in EARNEST weve tried) to change the systemthrough protest (both peaceful and otherwise), through education, through the courtsall in vain. The fact of the matter is the system is designed to resist change both from without and within. I think weve tallied enough usurpations by this point to call on the Declaration of Independance (and backed buy the 2nd amendment) as evidence and reason that the time has come to abolish the old (through force) in institute new protections for the people. I believe quarter must and should be given. That they be given the oppprtunity to surrended their arms and badges, and allowed to go home to their families if theu choose. That we must demonstrate unto them the mercy they have refused us time and again, to prove unequivocably that we are the better men (and women). Because we are. Three problems: 1. When non-violent means fail to produce results, violence is whats left. This is what is required. Weve been trying to use the courts for over 50 years now, they own the courts. 1. Using violence makes you as bad as our masters. 1. So the folks that fought for our independence were as bad as their mastersMr. Washington was certainly glad he didnt have cowards such as you serving in his army. We would still be knealing to the crown. Makes me wonder who, exactly, you work for in that you find the need to attempt to shape public opinion in such a manner. 1. Returning fire is defending yourself, your rights, and your property. On many points (such as tsa, patriot act, et al, we agree on. At the end of the day, our elected officialsarent. Theyre puppets. Putting them in prison amounts to very little. We need to get rid of the puppet masters (Israel, for one) before anything will matter. Your proposed random murders have escalated to getting rid of random countries. Prior to 9-11 the TSA did not exist, indefinite detention did not exist, the NSA did not spy on American citizens, the police werent given armored assault vehicles, and Americans could not be assassinated without trial. This is very true, Matt, best part of your article. Not long after 9/11, wh",0
"Newly uncovered documents at the National Archives reveal that Theodore Roosevelt was not only a burly outdoorsman, but also a gay man. 'We're not trying to debunk any myths here,' head archivist Fran Fretny said. 'All we're saying is that he was quite gay.' Evidence of Roosevelt's gayness include his excessive smiling; his jolly, booming voice; and his generally 'sunny' disposition.

"The writers of the HBO series The Sopranos took another daring storytelling step by killing off 10 million fans during the seventh season's premiere episode Sunday night. 'This was definitely a bold choice, one that producers of the show would have never thought of making five years ago,' said New York Times television critic Virginia Heffernan, who noted that the move was hinted at in a season-five episode in which Tony dreamt he was riding a horse through his house. 'But now that I look back, this was strongly foreshadowed throughout all of last season.' Industry insiders predicted that the show's producers would try to bring at least some fans back for the series finale, which may come as early as May. ",0
"US officials have confirmed they are supplying arms to a Kurdish-led coalition in Syria, angering Turkey and jeopardising a precarious common front in the war against Islamic State extremists. The officials say that the US is supplying only light weapons and they are going to the Arab contingent of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). However, Kurdish officials linked to the Peopleâ€™s Protection Units (YPG), the dominant partner in the SDF, say they have been promised the US will arm them directly if they lead the battle for Isisâ€™s Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. Ankara has reacted furiously to news of the arms supplies, as it views the YPG as a terrorist group, linked to Turkish Kurd militants. The countryâ€™s president, Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, said he found out about US planes carrying arms landing at the Kurdish-controlled town of Kobani, while he was attending the UN general assembly in New York, at which he met the US vice-president, Joe Biden. ErdoÄŸan claimed Biden said he was unaware of the arms deliveries.   Related: Life under Isis rule in Raqqa and Mosul: 'We're living in a giant prison'   The US insists that the weapons do not represent a threat to Ankara and are essential to the effort to deal a potentially decisive blow to Isis, something Obama is keen to achieve before leaving office. â€œWe are eager to go after Raqqa now. There is a real opportunity to crush the Caliphate,â€ a senior US administration official said. He said that although the Turks and Kurds clashed in August, they have together managed to expel Isis from the entire Turkish-Syrian border. Tensions were further defused when the YPG withdrew to a position east of the Euphrates, leaving the west bank mostly to the Turks and Turkish-backed elements of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Manbij town is still run by a SDF-dominated military council. The challenge now was to get them to cooperate in a deeper thrust into the Isis heartland. â€œOur entire strategy revolves around working the most capable forces. Sometimes those forces donâ€™t get on, but we are seeking to reduce the friction points between them,â€ the official said. On Tuesday, Washington dispatched the deputy secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to Ankara, along with Obamaâ€™s anti-Isis envoy, Brett McGurk, and Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of Inherent Resolve, the US-led military campaign against Isis. Their task was to mollify the Turks and maintain Turkish support for plans to capture three Isis bastions: Dabiq, Raqqa, and Mosul in Iraq.    Related: US-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq â€“ interactive   US officials hope to convince ErdoÄŸan that arming the SDF is the only way to strike a decisive blow at Raqqa, but Sinan Ãœlgen, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Brussels, said the more public the arms flow becomes, the harder it will be to accept for a government waging a war at home against insurgents of the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ party (PKK). â€œIt is one thing if the weapons assistance to the YPG remains a covert operation. But a change in declaratory policy with the US fully accepting this assistance is likely to give rise to a severe reaction in Ankara,â€ Ãœlgen said. â€œGiven the backdrop of the continuing campaign against the PKK with almost daily casualties, Ankara can never condone such a move by Washington. It will further fuel the rising anti-Americanism of the post-coup environment.â€ Ankara is reported to be mulling the deployment of Turkish infantry to Dabiq to support the faltering FSA units leading the cross-border operation, Euphrates Shield, with the ultimate aim of capturing al-Bab from Isis. But ErdoÄŸan has indicated he will not spare Turkish-trained militias for the advance on Mosul. That offensive will be led by Iraqi forces backed by up to 5,000 US advisers. At the same time, the YPG is asking for more than arms supplies. It wants its own seat at the table when it comes to negotiating Syriaâ€™s political future in Geneva. That would be a potential red line for Ankara, which fears eventual demands for a united Kurdish homeland straddling Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The US is attempting this balancing act at a time when relations between Washington and Ankara are already shaky in the wake of the attempted coup in July. ErdoÄŸan has blamed a Muslim cleric living in the US, Fethullah GÃ¼len, demanding his extradition. The Obama administration has asked for proof and meanwhile expressed unease at ErdoÄŸanâ€™s post-coup-attempt purges of the judiciary, government and the media, involving more than 32,000 arrests. â€œThe US is trying to thread an impossible needle at the moment: supporting the SDF and YPG while trying to assuage a Nato ally [who] is also in Syria,â€ said Aaron Stein, an expert on Turkey at the Atlantic Council.  Asked about arms supplies to the SDF, Col John Dorrian, a spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, said: â€œThe SDF, which is our partner organisation of vetted forces in Syria, have been stalwart allies and stalwart partners and have done a very good job in taking the fight to Daesh [Isis, also known as Isil].  â€œWe continue to work with them and we intend to keep doing so. We have for a long time been arming the SDF and the group in that SDF that weâ€™ve been working with very closely is the Syrian Arab Coalition,â€ Dorrian added. â€œWe arm the SAC and thatâ€™s â€“ thatâ€™s the nature of our relationship.â€     Antony Blinken, the US deputy secretary of state, during a visit to Turkey. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images   â€œI donâ€™t think the Turks are ever going to be happy with our relationship with the SDF. They are never going to be fine with it. But we are looking at establishing a live-and-let-live arrangement. We want to coordinate to take the fight against Isil,â€ a senior administration official said. â€œThe resupply goes to the Arab contingent in the SDF. If they find their way into YPG hands, itâ€™s not our intention and we havenâ€™t seen that, so far,â€ the official said. â€œAnd we are not talking about game-changing technology. We are not giving the fighters anything that would give them a qualitative edge in any fight with the Turks.â€ Stein said he shared Turkish scepticism about the US claim that arms going to the Arab contingent of the SDF would not end up in the YPGâ€™s possession.  â€œItâ€™s almost certain they share weapons. The SDF is only viable because the YPG is its backbone,â€ he said. â€œThe idea that you can air-drop weapons to one and not the other is not very credible.â€  A YPG commander told the Guardian that the US had supplied weapons to the group during the Manbij offensive, and was offering to do so again.  â€œWhen McGurk visited last time, [in early September], he spoke about the Raqqa operation and stated that the American special forces will participate in the operation to retake Raqqa, too,â€ the commander said. â€œMcGurk was categorical that providing heavy and light arms wonâ€™t be a problem for the US.â€  However, the commander said the Kurds had their own conditions for taking part in the Raqqa operation, including opening a land corridor connecting Kurdish cantons in north-east and north-west Syria. That would run through al-Bab, on which Turkey has its sights.  â€œWe have not received any arms and are waiting for the American governmentâ€™s response,â€ the commander said. ",1
"Mark Levin Destroys Obama On Live TV: Get Your A** Off The Golf Course [VIDEO] During a recent radio show, Mark Levin fearlessly called out Obama for being an unprofessional leader. You know, folks, an American is decapitated in the middle of the desert by some British-Islamo-Nazi puke, Levin began. This puke, this punk, ties one of our citizens up, his hands behind his back, lifts up his chin, and saws his head off! Is it too much to expect this pathetic president to spend more than five minutes on it? Though extreme, Levins comments highlight a common frustration many Americans share: Obama seems to be afraid or unwilling to take action. This man should have been in the Situation Room with the press there, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the head of his national security team, with the Director of the CIA, Levin continued. He should have been there with the President Pro Tem and the Senate Majority Leader and the Republican Leader. He should have been there with the Speaker of the House and the Democrat Leader in the House. And he should have been there and made a statementnot from the friggin golf course! Levi then went on to tell our president to get off the golf course. Im gonna be the father you never had, Levin concluded. Get your ass off the golf course, get the hell back into Washington, D.C., act like a president, or get the hell out! What do you think of Levins comments? Do you agree with him? Does Obama need to take action? ",0
"Itâ€™s been a rough week. So, some much-needed respite via the annual Marc Jacobs dress code â€“ the John Lewis Christmas advert of the fashion industry. To celebrate the launch of his resort collection, the American designer is having a bash. And, as per, it involves a dress code whose gnomic screed â€“ currently doing the rounds on social media â€“ is always fun to dissect, especially in the current mood. Last yearâ€™s was inspired by excess and Studio 54, and suggested guests arrive by horse. This time, thereâ€™s a focus on the 1980s (like his collection). Fashion-wise, itâ€™s in the ether, but what else can we learn? Guests, it instructs, should reference Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, the â€œdynamite socialiteâ€ (or, possibly, the mail distribution company in Thomas Pynchonâ€™s The Crying of Lot 49 â€“ neither end terribly well). â€œBig eyebrowsâ€ are decadent markers of a booming economy, as is big hair (Brooke Shields and Debbie Harry both get a mention). Heels are a must, or rather â€œvertiginous pumps like youâ€™re sitting pretty for your Andy portraitâ€, a spirited nod, perhaps, to the cult of celebrity. Equally, dressing like a princess, be it one from Monaco or â€œaÂ punk princessâ€, is recommended. Meanwhile, TED-talk buzzwords such as â€œsuccessâ€ and â€œfameâ€ read like a Trumpian diktat. Except, capitalist frenzy this is not. Jacobs, an out-and-out Democrat, also floats the word â€œparadiseâ€, which may be aÂ tribute to the famous New York club, Paradise Garage. Until it closed in 1987, Paradise Garage was precisely that: a parking garage on 84 King Street in Manhattan. Culturally, however, its clout was huge, as it was one of the few clubs in New York that the gay African-American and Latino community could call their own. There was no alcohol licence, so it could stay open after-hours, and it wasnâ€™t open to the general public. Refuge is a little extreme, but people certainly came to Paradise to dance without prejudice. The Marc Jacobs party, perhaps, offers more of the same: â€œNo posers,â€ warns the dress code, â€œand definitely no preppies.â€ Hairspray, on the other hand, appears to be non-negotiable.  ",1
"Irony in Canada: 300 Arrested at Protest Against Police BrutalityAmanda Warren The official reason for the arrests was that the protesters did not alert the proper authorities in regards to their location and intentions their itinerary, police said. Arrests were made although the organization responsible for leading the protests, the Collective Opposing Police Brutality (COPB), has organized protests in the same location for the past 18 years. Police still claim they require prior notification for a demonstration. Police spokesman Ian Lafrenire said: In addition, police claim that crowds were unruly and that they were refusing to stay out of the street and were blocking traffic against police commands. Protesters, however, disagree and accused police of lying about the sequence of events. What is clear, however, is that the police swooped in and began making arrests before the protest largely got off the ground according to RT. After only a few minutes, riot police arrived on Jean-Talon street, surrounded the protesters and initiated a mass arrest. Protesters claim an extremely heavy police presence with not only riot police, but officers on horses and even helicopters. COPBs protest this year was focused on drawing attention to the issue of social cleansing where they claim authorities try to get rid of people they deem unwanted. For instance, the group cites an Perhaps most ironic, one person was reported by officers as having sustained injuries to his face during police intervention and was aided by paramedics on site. This writer couldnt help notice some of the language used to describe the protest. One report called the protest an annual stand-off and RT said that the protesters were brandishing banners.

"Zafar Ansari has spoken of his pride at being one of four players representing the ethnic diversity in the current England Test team and has said the value that others see in this is good for society. According to England and Wales Cricket Board figures quoted in Wisden, players of Asian heritage make up almost 40% of recreational cricketers in the UK and with Ansari, his fellow spin-bowlers Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, and the opening batsman Haseeb Hameed, all playing in the drawn first Test in Rajkot last week, it was the first time that the national team has reflected this figure. Michael Vaughan, the former England captain, was quoted on Monday as praising a merit-based selection that could, as a by-product, inspire the next generation of young cricketers of Asian heritage in the country. When that was put to Ansari, who like Moeen, Rashid and Hameed identifies himself as British Muslim, the left-arm spinner agreed.   Related: England buoyed by opening draw but can expect a tougher India next time round | Ali Martin   â€œAs a collective, as a group of four British Muslims, there is something in that,â€ the 24-year-old said. â€œThereâ€™s no doubt thatâ€™s really exciting and something weâ€™re proud of. A lot of people outside the group clearly care about that and value that a lot. And that is a good thing in our society.â€ Ansari was born to an English mother and a Pakistani father, both of whom are professors at the University of Londonâ€™s Royal Holloway college, and as a nonâ€‘practising Muslim who did not grow up in a British Asian community he acknowledges his own background is different to Moeen, Rashid and Hameedâ€™s. He said: â€œFrom a personal point of view, I wouldnâ€™t hold myself up as a role model. At least in that way. Iâ€™m from a very privileged background. I donâ€™t necessarily challenge norms in a particularly obvious way or even in a superficial way. So I wouldnâ€™t necessarily characterise myself as breaking down boundaries. â€œBut Moeen, Adil and Haseeb â€“ all of them are doing a wonderful job representing, if they are representing, their communities. And thatâ€™s not an easy role to play, even if theyâ€™re just being themselves, but theyâ€™re doing it really well.â€ That Ansari speaks so thoughtfully on the subject should come of little surprise, with his father, Professor Khizar Humayun Ansari, appointed OBE in 2002 for his work as the director of his universityâ€™s centre of ethnic minority studies, while his mother, Professor Sarah Ansari, is a historian who specialises in the south Asia region post-partition in 1947. Ansari himself was recently awarded a double-first in politics and sociology from Cambridge, having combined his studies with a rise up the cricketing ranks of the Surrey academy and into the first team, something that has now culminated in his first two Test caps this winter. After making his debut in the second Test against Bangladesh, Ansari put in an encouraging performance in Rajkot last week, where he claimed three wickets and compiled a composed 32 over two hours at the crease during Englandâ€™s first innings. Despite one spell in which he lost his rhythm, he is feeling more settled.   Related: Englandâ€™s Haseeb Hameed reminiscent of Sangakkara, says Trevor Bayliss   Ansari, who describes himself as not a â€œnaturalâ€ cricketer, said: â€œMy second Test felt easier than the first from a psychological perspective. Itâ€™s just the attention being removed from you to some extent. â€œAs an England player people are always observing but that singular attention shifting away is a big thing for the second Test and going forward. It allows you to play the game as a game rather than as an event that you are the centre of. So hopefully that continues.â€ Asked how he has come so far despite not being a natural, he replied: â€œI guess itâ€™s all relative. Iâ€™m probably comparing myself with Moeen and people like that. At least from the outside. They work incredibly hard but, from the outside, they have a certain touch that maybe I donâ€™t feel like I quite have. â€œBut this is just my perspective. Other people might say: â€˜Youâ€™re talking rubbish; youâ€™re being selfâ€‘deprecating.â€™ But thatâ€™s genuine.â€",1

"OTTAWA â€” The move-to-Canada memes started spreading in earnest shortly after Donald J. Trump looked increasingly likely to win Florida: â€œElection Night Starter Kit,â€ read a post on Instagram, above photos of United States passports and an Air Canada plane. Another post depicted a machine-gun-toting man riding a moose, with the words â€œCanadian Border Patrol Watching for Illegal Americans.â€The comedians may have been on to something. Later on Tuesday night, the website of Canadaâ€™s immigration department crashed. Social media quickly filled with speculation that it had been overloaded by Americans looking for a new country to call home.Lisa Filipps, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, said on Wednesday that the departmentâ€™s site had failed â€œas a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic,â€ but gave no details about the source of the traffic. The site was back in operation by midmorning but responded slowly and erratically.Such a desire to flee an election result in the United States is often expressed, but rarely borne out. On the other side of the border, Canadians reacted to Mr. Trumpâ€™s election win with concerns of their own, even anxiety, but also a whiff of pride.â€œIt definitely makes me happy to live under the Trudeau government,â€ said Cordell Jacks, 36, an international development worker in Vancouver, British Columbia, referring to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Mr. Jacks added that he wanted to see his country become a leader in championing human rights and battling climate change. â€œCanadaâ€™s going to be in a higher position to take on global issues that Americaâ€™s going to put to the side,â€ he said.Since becoming prime minister a year ago with a promise of â€œsunny ways,â€ Mr. Trudeau has enjoyed an unusually close relationship with President Obama. Now the Canadian government must plan for a future where the differences between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump will probably go far beyond style.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump rejected action to mitigate climate change while Mr. Trudeau has made it a priority, including setting minimum national carbon taxes. While Mr. Trudeau caught the worldâ€™s attention by fulfilling a promise to admit 25,000 refugees from Syria, Mr. Trump has proposed closing the United Statesâ€™ doors to them. And Mr. Trump has argued that Americaâ€™s allies should increase their military spending at a time when Mr. Trudeau is backing away from combat roles for Canada in favor of United Nations peacekeeping missions.For a country with an economy that depends heavily on exports to the United States, the most worrying uncertainty for Canada involves Mr. Trumpâ€™s protectionist trade stance and his vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. While Mr. Trumpâ€™s attacks on Nafta have mostly been aimed at Mexico, the pact, and the agreement between Canada and the United States that it incorporated, effectively left much of Canadaâ€™s industry largely producing for export.Mark Warner, a trade lawyer in Toronto, said that while it was unclear what Mr. Trump had in mind for Nafta, he feared that a Trump administration would rekindle old trade battles with Canada.â€œWeâ€™re going to get sideswiped by some of this stuff,â€ Mr. Warner said. In particular, he said he expected Mr. Trump to promote â€œBuy Americaâ€ clauses in government infrastructure projects that would shut out Canadian companies â€” a violation of Nafta.Not every Canadian, of course, was displeased by the election result.â€œAs a gay, liberal, health care-loving Canadian, most of my friends thought I was crazy to be supporting Trump,â€ Ashley MacIsaac, who is perhaps Canadaâ€™s most famous fiddle player, said in an email. â€œBut I suggested he had to win to offer a chance for world peace by preventing WWIII with Russia and for his stance on radical Islam.â€In Cape Breton, Nova Scotia â€” Mr. MacIsaacâ€™s home â€” the life of Rob Calabrese, a radio disc jockey, has been unexpectedly upended by a tongue-in-cheek website he set up in February: Cape Breton If Trump Wins. Despite a surge in election night traffic, the site did not crash. And the election result, Mr. Calabrese said, generated about 200 emails overnight.â€œIt was all very playful before, but now there seems to be a sense of urgency to them,â€ he said of the emails.Andrew Griffith, a former director general of the citizenship and multiculturalism branch of Canadaâ€™s immigration department, said most of those suggesting they would leave because of Mr. Trump would not qualify as refugees and would have to go through a system that rates them based on factors such as education and job skills.Having a firm offer for a skilled job in Canada can make getting a visa a relatively fast process, Mr. Griffith said. But in general the process can be protracted, expensive and without guarantees. And for almost everyone, he added, starting life over in a new country, even one next door, would be disruptive.â€œItâ€™s not an automatic process despite the Twitter posts saying â€˜Youâ€™re all welcome here,â€™ â€ Mr. Griffith said. â€œWell, youâ€™re not all welcome.â€",1
"Pope Benedict XVI used a famous Portuguese shrine to the Virgin Mary on Thursday as a venue to denounce abortion and gay marriage, just days before Portugal is expected to join five European countries that have legalized same-sex weddings. In a speech here to Catholic social service groups, Benedict called for initiatives aimed at protecting 'the family based on the indissoluble marriage between a man and a woman, help to respond to some of today's most insidious and dangerous threats to the common good.' He also said he expressed his 'deep appreciation for all those social and pastoral initiatives aimed at combating the socioeconomic and cultural mechanisms which lead to abortion, and are openly concerned to defend life and to promote the reconciliation and healing of those harmed by the tragedy of abortion.' The audience in a chapel at the shrine gave the pope a standing ovation. The pope's remarks came on the third day of a four-day visit aimed at shoring up Christian belief in increasingly secular Europe, although it has been somewhat eclipsed by the sexual-abuse scandal confronting the Vatican in recent weeks. Benedict also has used the visit to signal a more forceful tone in confronting the abuse, which he has called a 'sin inside the church.' Although it is 90 percent Catholic, Portugal has seen a notable shift away from Catholic teaching in recent years. The country legalized abortion in 2008 and its Parliament recently approved a bill permitting same-sex marriage. President Anibal Cavaco Silva is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days. The church has opposed the measure, but Portuguese society appears to be largely supportive. Portugal would be the sixth country in Europe to legalize same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Norway and Sweden. France and Denmark recognize same-sex unions, which convey many but not all of the rights enjoyed by married couples. Throughout his 5-year-old papacy, Benedict has endeavored to shape a new identity for the church as a 'creative minority' in an increasingly secular Europe. On Thursday, he denounced 'the pressure exerted by the prevailing culture, which constantly holds up a lifestyle based on the law of the stronger, on easy and attractive gain.' The pope also told the social service groups to find alternatives to state financing so they would not be subject to legislation at odds with Catholic teaching, urging them to 'ensure that Christian charitable activity is granted autonomy and independence from politics and ideologies, even while cooperating with state agencies in the pursuit of common goals.' Addressing bishops later on Thursday, Benedict called for 'authentic witnesses to Jesus Christ' in 'those human situations where the silence of the faith is most widely and deeply felt: among politicians, intellectuals, communications professionals who profess and who promote a monocultural ideal, with disdain for the religious and contemplative dimension of life.' He added that 'in such circles are found some believers who are ashamed of their beliefs and who even give a helping hand to this type of secularism, which builds barriers before Christian inspiration.' Earlier on Thursday, Benedict celebrated Mass before an estimated half a million faithful on the anniversary of the day three peasant children are said to have seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary here in 1917. Tradition has it that the Virgin revealed three secrets to the children: One was interpreted as predicting the end of World War I and the start of World War II, the second to have predicted the rise and fall of communism, which gave Fatima an anti-communist allure during the Cold War. Pope John Paul II credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving him from an assassination attempt in 1981. In 2000, the Vatican revealed the third secret of Fatima, which it said prefigured the attempt. Since arriving in Portugal on Tuesday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the beatification of two of the peasant children, Benedict has sought to broaden the significance of the message of Fatima to help the church overcome its difficulties in the sexual-abuse scandal.

"FDA Limits Usage of Antibiotics in Livestock After Activist OutcryAnthony Gucciardi However, the FDA is not completely revoking approval for the antibiotics, only placing an order for farmers to stop using the drugs solely to help animals grow whats more, the farmers are given another 3 years before any real legal action goes into effect. The initial proposal was introduced back in 1977, and the FDA has stalled for decades to give a final answer. That means that antibiotics used to treat animal diseases, or even prevent future diseases, will be perfectly fine under these guidelines. The result may have to do with the livestock corporate juggernauts, who refused to admit that the mass drugging of animals with superbug-breeding antibiotics posed any real threat to the public. Many consumer activists, such as Laura Rogers from thePew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming, fear that these new guidelines are so broad that they mean virtually nothing. If you were to ask me whats the biggest gap, its that theyve left way too much wiggle room [leeway] when it comes to preventative uses, said Rogers. Thats going to have to be shored up [i.e., made more specific] in order for this action to be meaningful. In fact, the resistanttuberculosis strains a direct result of excess antibiotic consumption are so serious that scientists are calling it the new white plague. Even members of the World Health Organizations Stop TB Partnership are outraged over the man-made disease progression, with memberLucica Ditiustating thatthe drug-resistant TB is a totally man-made disease. Outside of super viruses, antibiotics have also been linked to mental illness as a result of compromised gut health.

"From Bowie to Brexit, it is generally agreed that 2016 has been a disaster of such epic proportions that the sooner we race to 31 December and start over, the better. But Iâ€™d like to propose a slighty different take: it is also the year that people finally started to listen to the voices of women who have suffered sexual assault. Instead of dismissing them as faceless sluts who somehow brought this on themselves, public and politicians alike are saying: â€œYou know what? Iâ€™m going to draw my line right here.â€ The ultimate example of this â€“ the one looming just a little too close over your shoulder â€“ is Donald Trump, whose campaign was finally derailed by his boasts about sexual assault. Trump has spent millions on his campaign, only to be exposed in a similar way to Jimmy Savile â€“ in the sense that everything was always in plain sight, but few cared enough about the victims to complain. Until now. Since the leak of the tapes in which he shared his sexy assault tactics with his grinning chimp of a sidekick Billy Bush (just when you think youâ€™ve plumbed the depths of the Bush family, thereâ€™s always one more moron in the cupboard), the stories that have been around are finally being heard: the women whose breasts he grabbed, whose dressing rooms he strode into. Trump had been doing all of this for years; in many instances, heâ€™s done it on air. Back in 2004, when he was 58, he said on the radio that heâ€™d like to sleep with the then 18-year-old Lindsay Lohan, because â€œdeeply, deeply troubled women are the best in bedâ€. Like Savile, Trump revelled in his brazenness: in 2006, when Howard Stern told Trump he was â€œa sexual predatorâ€, he nodded with a laugh while his daughter Ivanka â€“ that self-described supporter of women â€“ giggled and patted her fatherâ€™s shoulder. Like I say, none of this is new. In 1992, the Chicago Tribune reported that Trump told a pair of 14-year-old girls: â€œIn a couple of years, Iâ€™ll be dating you.â€ Back then, that story was headlined Such A Comedian; this year, it is being retold as evidence of his unacceptable grossness. This is not about a gradual enlightening of attitudes; rather, a sharp corner has been turned. The pivot was Bill Cosby. Last year, New York magazine published its now iconic cover, featuring portraits of 35 of the women who accused Cosby of assaulting them. It became impossible for people to keep ignoring them, as they had been for years (again, these were not new allegations). Whispered rumours of sexual assault are no longer seen as amusing or alpha male behaviour â€“ boys will be boys! â€“ even if Trump still seems to think they are. They are, finally, a bridge too far. The public is catching up with this quicker thanÂ the law or the media. Earlier this year, American student Brock Turner was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman. Newspaper reports of the case invariably refer to Turner as the â€œStanford swimmerâ€, which is either Latin for â€œrapistâ€ (IÂ didnâ€™t go to Stanford, so what do IÂ know?) or aÂ suggestion that Turnerâ€™s education and hobbies are more important than his proclivity for sexual assault. After Turner was sentenced to just six months in prison, the victimâ€™s impact statement sparked widespread fury; a petition for the judgeâ€™s removal has more than 1.3m signatures.   Related: When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they donâ€™t mean me. Or do they?   This is why last weekendâ€™s front-page Sunday Times interview with Ched Evans felt so retrograde. Whatever anyone thinks of the case, and the way the victimâ€™s sexual history was used to humiliate her in court, the contrast between Evansâ€™ demonstrably repulsive attitude towards women and the absurdly romantic depiction of his family life was like something out of the 80s. Nowhere in the interview was he asked whether he often creeps into hotel rooms to watch his friends having sex. Instead, there were photographs of Evans playing with his dogs like aÂ modern-day St Francis, alongside the girlfriend who bankrolled his case, and their baby. Anita Hill, who knows this subject too well, recently wrote an editorial in the Boston Globe. â€œResponses to sexual harassment and other formsÂ of sexual violence must start with a belief that women matter as much as the powerful men they encounter,â€ she argued. The powerful man Hill encountered, and whom in 1991 she accused ofÂ sexual harassment, is still sitting on the Supreme Court. But 2016 is looking a little different. The man who has become emblematic of all the worstÂ things about male privilege and sexual entitlement is on the verge of being beaten to theÂ highest political office by a woman. Things arenâ€™t perfect. But theyâ€™re getting better. Step byÂ step, woman by woman.",1
"First American Olympian To Wear Hijab, Turns On Us With One Sickening Move [VIDEO] Ibtihaj Muhammad is the first American Muslim to compete in the Olympics in hijab, after the United States gave her special permission to break dress code. That didnt stop the New Jersey native from turning on our country the moment she arrived in Rio. [I feel unsafe] all the time, she said in an interview. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to the police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City. I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they dont come even close to things weve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. Its ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment. Muhammad also said she hopes that the fact that she is competing in the Olympics makes life easier for Muslims in the United States. Im hoping that with my first-time appearance as a member of Team USA here at the Olympics, Im hoping that the rhetoric around the Muslim community will change, she concluded. What do you think of Muhammads comments? ",0

"ONLY two of the 20-plus reporters who covered the presidential campaign for The New York Times were black. None were Latino or Asian. Thatâ€™s less diversity than youâ€™ll find in Donald Trumpâ€™s cabinet thus far. Of The Timesâ€™s newly named White House team, all six are white, as is most everyone in the Washington bureau.Traveling to other departments, Metro has only three Latinos among its 42 reporters, in a city with the second largest Hispanic population in the country. Sports has one Asian man, two Hispanics and no African-Americans among its 21 reporters, yet blacks are plentiful among the teams they cover and the audience they serve. In the Styles section, every writer is white, while American culture is anything but.The executive editor, Dean Baquet, is African-American. The other editors on his masthead are white. The staff with the most diversity? The news assistants, who mostly do administrative jobs and get paid the least.The Times can be relentless in questioning the diversity at other institutions; it has written about the white ranks of the technology sector, public schools, police departments, Oscar nominees, law firms, legislatures, the major leagues and the Ivy League. Fixing its own problems comes less easily.The newsroomâ€™s blinding whiteness hit me when I walked in the door six months ago. Itâ€™s hardly a new problem here, but itâ€™s one that persists even as the country grows more diverse and The Times grows more global. The head of that global expansion, Lydia Polgreen, was one of The Timesâ€™s highest-ranking African-American editors until she left last week to lead The Huffington Post. Her departure hit the whole newsroom hard, but it was especially a blow to many minority journalists here.In the past three months, I have interviewed people across the newsroom about the issue of race (and to some degree gender, which Iâ€™ll address in a future column). Iâ€™ve spoken with journalists of all racial and ethnic identities, in jobs high and low: white men and black women, editors and reporters, department heads and news assistants. It left me believing there is a level of frustration bordering on anger that would be institutionally reckless not to address.Many journalists hoped a new era was beginning two and a half years ago, when Baquet became the first African-American to oversee the newsroom. But whatever progress has been made is only beginning to show up on a scorecard. Overall, newsroom diversity is at 22 percent, up slightly but below newsrooms in most big metropolitan areas. And of those who head departments here, only three are people of color.I asked Baquet what he believes minorities in the newsroom would say about his senior teamâ€™s dedication to diversity.â€œI think theyâ€™d say we have a problem,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re not diverse enough. But I think theyâ€™d say I have a commitment to it and that itâ€™s gotten better in the past year.â€ He added, â€œMy effort to diversify has been intense and persistent.â€By that, Baquet particularly means the handful of prominent black journalists heâ€™s helped attract or promote, stars like Nikole Hannah-Jones, Wesley Morris and Jenna Wortham, all coveted by The Timesâ€™s competitors.Their writing styles offer a refreshing break from The Timesâ€™s rather institutional voice, which â€” as one black editor put it to me â€” is older, white, male, Ivy League and authoritative. â€œThatâ€™s who The Times is at a dinner party,â€ she said.Many of those I spoke with, including Latinos and Asians, said the arrival of a few stars can take the focus away from the real issue of bringing in and retaining diversity across the room. In other words, while big names are rightfully celebrated, they can give the appearance of more diversity than there really is.Whatâ€™s more, just because an African-American is at the helm, it doesnâ€™t mean all is well in the newsroom he runs. â€œWe canâ€™t look to Dean as proof that everything is O.K., and we also canâ€™t look solely to him for solutions,â€ said Nikita Stewart, a Metro staff reporter.When you ask managers about the issue individually, everyone genuinely seems to care. Collectively, however, not much changes.They begin by saying this is an industrywide problem, not just a New York Times problem. That is true, unquestionably. On the other hand, itâ€™s also true that data from the American Society of News Editors shows that The Times is less diverse than large papers like The Washington Post (31 percent), The Los Angeles Times (34 percent) and The Miami Herald (41 percent). The Times is more diverse than The Boston Globe (17 percent) and The Philadelphia Inquirer (14 percent).Given The Timesâ€™s ambitions across global cultures and languages, it would seem that instead of being a lagger, it would insist on being a leader â€” and make that an explicit goal. I see no sign that this is happening. Nor do I get the impression from many journalists of color I spoke with that they believe progress is on the horizon.â€œThereâ€™s always a reason for such little diversity in newsrooms. Over the course of time, the reasons always change, but the underrepresentation never does,â€ said Hannah-Jones, who writes for the Times Magazine, one of the few notably diverse staffs in the building.Ernesto LondoÃ±o, who sits on The Timesâ€™s editorial board â€” and on an Opinion staff lacking both gender and racial diversity â€” believes the problem lies in a failure of editors to step outside their white-knows-white circles. â€œIt takes a concerted effort to break out of that habit and tap talent pools that are more diverse,â€ LondoÃ±o said.Which means that unless the pattern breaks, the whiter the newsroom is, the whiter it will stay.Mark Thompson, The Times chief executive officer, told a group of top leaders across the corporate and news sides last spring that managers could face dismissal if they failed to diversify their staffs. Baquet, who was at the meeting, didnâ€™t sound that militant in our conversation, saying that his editors feel the most pressure through a stringent expectation to bring forth a diverse applicant pool for every job opening. No one has been punished, he says.I can tell diversity isnâ€™t a priority here by looking at what is. Think digital transition or global expansion or subscriber growth or visual innovation. Those are mandates that really power up the engines. Diversity is not at that level, at least yet.This issue has challenged most every newsroom manager, myself included. The newsroom I came from, The Washington Post, is quite diverse, but its leadership is heavily white and male. At The Times, on the other hand, people of color seem shut out of all sorts of coveted jobs: the top digital strategists, the top managers, the precious ranks of cultural critics, the White House press corps, the opinion columnists, the national politics jobs â€” all are overwhelmingly white.It is possible to change this. But The Times will need more humility, introspection and openness than has been its habit in the past.Note: This column explores The Timesâ€™s diversity crisis, primarily through race. Future columns will address the struggles to fix this issue, news coverage, the widening gender gap, and the limited geographic, religious and ideological diversity. Stay tuned.",1
"A senior Palestinian official on Wednesday accused Israel for putting new obstacles before the Middle East peace process, saying that Israel is not serious in resuming peace talks. Nabil Abu Rdeina, spokesman of the Palestinian president, slammed the earlier statement of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he said that Israel will go on with settlement activities in East Jerusalem. 'These statements don't contribute to creating the proper atmosphere to succeed the proximity talks between the two sides. On the contrary, it would lead to more freeze in the process,' said Abu Rdeina. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said that Israel will continue building and developing the city as the Palestinians want its eastern part as a future capital. Netanyahu also said that 'no other nation has the same ties' to Jerusalem as Israel does. Though comprising Jewish and Christian temples, the walled eastern compound of the city also contains Al- Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine for Muslims. Abu Rdeina called on Israel to be committed to what had been agreed upon with the American side, adding 'such statements and such actions should be stopped to prepare for the atmosphere to let the proximity talks go on.' Palestine Liberation Organizations (PLO) executive committee chaired by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had early this week okayed the proximity talks with Israel. ",1

"As a boy, rushing south from Chesterfield on the train, I remember how the farmland was interrupted by the Avenue coking works breathing fire and acrid smoke like a malign dragon. Eight hundred people worked there, producing fuel for steel works, along with sulphuric acid and tar, in one of the most contaminated industrial sites in Europe.    Related: How industrial sites can play a key role in wildlife conservation   The coking chimney and cooling tower â€“ and all the rest of it â€“ came down more than 10 years ago, and the air cleared. I had barely thought of it since, until, passing recently, I noticed through the carriage window reed ponds and luxuriant scrub. At the end of a narrow lane, on the fringes of Wingerworth, a corner of the vast complex had been turned into a nature reserve split by the railway tracks and taking in a stretch of the Rother.  The old branch line that once fed coal to the plant now allows easy access for wheelchairs and a view across the ponds; in winter there are teal and wigeon.     Reclaimed land at the old Avenue factory now attracts birds like the siskin. Photograph: Richard Bowler/Rex/Shutterstock   I was drawn to the thick clumps of shrubs and trees â€“ dog roses studded with hips tangled with a hawthorn smothered in haws, apple trees thick with fruit, a gnarled, low, ash still with its leaves.  Such a rich source of food brought scores of birds: a flock of goldfinches describing shallow dips though the air, half a dozen chaffinches and, deep in the green, trapped in a sudden burst of evening sunshine, the brilliant yellow of a siskin. The Rother is a narrow stream here, half hidden against the railway. It must have suffered badly from its proximity to the coking plant. Now it is clear and vibrant, thick with weed. I can well believe there are water voles living here, despite the shiny abandoned microwave splitting the current like a reef.     A sparrowhawk Photograph: Mike Warburton Photography/Getty/Flickr Open   Scraps of garbage and concrete barriers make for a semi-industrial wild space but I emerged from the tunnel beneath the tracks to a scene of wonder â€“ a female sparrowhawk slicing between two trees, the scrub noisy with alarm calls and a shower sweeping in from the moors to the west.

"The future of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is in question following Tuesday's death of a freshman senator in what authorities believe to be a hazing incident. Outgoing Speaker Of The House Newt Gingrich answers reporters' questions regarding hazing practices within Congress. Inset: Freshman Sen. Thomas Pruitt (R-RI), who died early Tuesday morning after he was beaten and forced to drink more than a liter of vodka by senior legislators. Sen. Thomas Pruitt (R-RI), 38, sworn into the 106th Congress on Jan. 7, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital at 2:20 a.m. and pronounced dead soon after. An autopsy found toxic levels of alcohol in the congressional pledge's system, and attending physicians found numerous bruises and welts on his back and buttocks. Sen. John Warner (R-VA), Pruitt's designated 'big brother' during Committee Rush, is reportedly under investigation for negligence in connection with the death, though no formal charges have yet been filed. Pruitt's death is only the latest in a string of hazing incidents to plague Congress in recent years. During January 1995's Capitol Hell Week, incoming Rep. Gerard Schuman (D-NM) fell out of a fourth-floor Capitol Building window to his death. An autopsy found Schuman's blood-alcohol content to be four times the legal level of intoxication, a condition widely believed to be the result of a hazing incident in which for six hours he was forced to drink a shot of vodka every time he failed to correctly answer a question about Robert's Rules Of Order. In 1997, a Capitol janitor found first-term Sen. Mike Dewine (R-OH) passed out in the building's boiler room, wearing only his underwear and covered in peanut butter and feathers. The latest fatality is regarded by Beltway insiders as a grave blow to the already embattled Republican Party, coming so soon after the twin resignations of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who stepped down over the scandal resulting from his forcing House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) to drink a gallon of Crisco Oil, and incoming Speaker Bob Livingston (R-LA), who quit last month amid sexual-misconduct allegations surrounding a midnight panty raid on the Capitol's Congresswomen's Suite. Only a few legislators were willing to comment publicly on Pruitt's death. 'The freshmen keep getting hazed, but they're afraid to press charges or even speak out about it,' Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) told reporters. 'I remember a few years ago, there was a new representative named Sam Haskell who was forced to masturbate onto a piece of bread and then eat it. He was one of the few who went public with his hazing, and, from that day on, he was treated like a total pariah by fellow legislators. Every bill he ever proposed died in committee.' 'Rules and Administration is notorious for its hazings,' said one longtime senator, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'Sen. Michael Enzi (R-WY) had to swim across the Potomac at midnight with a lit candle in his ass. A freshman from Georgia had all of his toes broken. The list goes on. But what are you going to do about it? If you rock the boat, the party leaders can make it a very long six years for you.' Though Pruitt's death is the first for Rules and Administration, it is not the first time the powerful senate committee has stirred controversy. During Hell Week 1995, Congressional Black Caucus leaders formally protested a 'mock slave auction' held by the committee. Outraged by the latest death, constituents across the U.S. are calling for stricter anti-hazing laws for Congress. 'It's time to put a stop to this hazing,' said Jim Campos of Kirkland, WA. There are better ways to show one's loyalty to his subcommittee.' Lucille Thalaker of Tallahassee, FL, agreed. 'Why should I even bother to vote if the person I elect may not even live to see their first House referendum?' 'Clearly, what happened to Sen. Pruitt went beyond the relatively innocuous committee-initiation stunts like the old 'Freedonian Aid Bill' prank, in which they get some unsuspecting frosh to pledge $675 million in aid to a non-existent country,' said freshman Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), holding the watermelon she must take with her everywhere she goes for the next three weeks. 'The truly extreme hazing has got to stop.' Still, some observers defended Congress' long-standing first-semester traditions. 'If they cracked down on every committee that just wanted to have a little fun with the new legislators, you'd lose great, harmless stuff like the time Patrick Moynihan streaked through the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' debate on Chinese human-rights abuses,' said noted political scholar Dr. James Throckmorton. 'When you compare the stuff happening today to hazings in the past, the modern era absolutely pales. I mean, for his initiation, Strom Thurmond was required to bare-knuckle box a doughty Irish longshoreman for 30 rounds.' But whatever reforms, if any, are made, they will come too late for Sen. Pruitt. 'All Tom ever wanted to do was lower the capital-gains tax, reduce the trade deficit, and play quarterback in the Senate Mud Bowl,' said Lincoln Almond, Rhode Island's governor and a good friend of Pruitt's. 'Now that can never be.' ",0
"Twittered Government Spying, Journalists, Robert Green and The Removal of Temporary Privileges: Writing ContestAlex George Carlin once said: You have no rights, you have a set of privileges which can be taken away at any time and a right is not a right if it can be taken away- its a temp. privilege By **** he was right! After 4 days on Twitter I lost my right to tweet . . . OK not a god given right . . . FREE SPEECH! But then what is? For those of you who may not be aware Robert Green was a UK journalist who had his temp. privilege the right to be free removed for the crime of planning to hand out fliers which asked for an honest independent investigation into an alleged crime. He was jailed for 9 months for breach of the peace with an additional 3 months added for breach of bail. Sounds impossible doesnt it? But try factoring in that the person he believed to be guilty was a judge and former colleague of the judge that sentenced him. I shut down my first Twitter account months back after receiving threats and abuse for pointing the facts out about the illegal war in Libya in a letter to Parliament. My MP took the letter I sent so seriously I received a response from A Burt at the foreign office which, in his mind at least, justified: Against my better judgement I set up a new Twitter account; my intention being to share information which has been beneficial to my family about alternative medicine, especially with regard to treating cancer. My thought was that if I put the information to Gary Lineker and had him pass it on to Stillian Petrov, once they realised it was proven fact that nature has provided us with what we need to stay/get healthy for thousands of years, it could cause reverberations around the health industry and start a revolution. In China, until recently, 1 in 10,000 women died of breast cancer each year, opposed to one in 12 in UK. Rather than answer the question, I instead asked Linker to investigate it for himself by sending him a link to Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy a book by Dirk Bennedict which details how shunning conventional cancer treatment and switching to a macrobiotic diet had cured him. I encourage you to research this for yourselves; you will find the information shared by people such as Rick Simpson, Mike Adams, David Icke, Ian Crane, etc. has been known to man for thousands of years and has been suppressed since the Rockefellers took over the oil and medicine industries. I am delighted to say that information shared by David Icke, Ian Crane etc. has been very beneficial with regard to the health of one of my family members. As a result, I felt compelled to share it, having achieved my original goal and having made some new friends in the process. I then looked to share other information and perhaps have some interesting questions answered. Was the threat of War with Iran what drove oil prices through the roof and benefited those who had speculated on oil futures back in October (see Gordon Duffs article Something fishy in the Gulf) My opinion is that although some experts will say that War with Iran is inevitable in order to impose a Rothschild-controlled central bank, having seen the Iranian president you will find that he makes the sign of baphomet and greets US presenters with Masonic handshakes this, in my mind at least, signals to the occult world that he is already a puppet doing his masters bidding. The real War is the financial War yes, the day will most likely come when they bomb Iran to the ground, then rebuild it but not until they have milked every cent out of oil futures first. Another thing I shared with a journalist on Twitter was a question: Were details of Whitney Houstons conversion to Islam removed from the English version of the Web? Before her death this was all over the Web Now I can only find it in the Italian mainstream media http://www.ilmessaggero.it/articolo.php?id=180647# Okay, four busy days on Twitter. What lead up to my removal was explaining the original Carlin quote to a journalist, equating it to two News stories from this week: If a journalist can get the authority to hack into your emails because it may be in the public interest do you really think a Government agent cannot? In reality, they have been snooping on us for years. George Carlin was right you just have a bunch of temporary privileges which they can take away without hesitation under things such as the broadest b/s legislation ever the anti terrorism legislation implemented as planned after 7/7 9/11. Yes they have the right to access ALL of your information without your knowledge because they might have a suspicion or they might know someone who suspects that you might know something. I.E. they need no excuse at all. And what happens when the Government announce a plan to do.. well what they already do.. a bunch of uniformed people say.. Im really annoyed.. Please stop.. And the government give them the illusion of power.. To this end, I suggest that the immediate removal of my right to tweet proves that the Government clawing back on privacy plans due to uproar was only a smoke screen. An illusion to distract the public about what goes on in the real world you know a World where our government views security as ensuring its sponsors make money from the oil and opium trade, the means of which is forcing our soldiers to kill and die for the resources raped and pillaged in blood from the world over. As Gregg Braden said the Earth will be here in 5000 years. Whether or not we as a race will still be on it, or whether we destroy ourselves by fighting with each other for resources, which is shared equally would easily sustain us, is up to us. I long for a world where the people should encourage the best honest minds amongst us (Gregg Braden, Max Keiser, Stacy Herbert, Alex Jones, David Icke, Mike Adams, Richard D Hall, Ian R Crane, Al Martin, Gordon Duff, etc.) get together for the benefit of the people to discuss how the information regarding how suppressed sources of health/energy/technology should be released, thus saving millions of lives and uniting us as one race working together in order that we understand and develop it in order to benefit ourselves as a global community. If you are an intelligence officer reading this I imagine you signed up for the agency to do good. I ask you: ARE you doing good by backing the elite with their plan to wipe the majority of humanity off the planet whilst making as much bloodmoney as possible through human sacrifice? Or would you be doing good by standing up for people like Robert Green who should not only be freed BUT should be respected and congratulated for having the balls to stand up for what is right? We the people have a right to that but we have to stand together as the PEOPLE and show our governments and the people that sponsor them that we are taking away their temporary privilege of ruling us. The first step is to stand up as the people and ask that the good journalists and intelligence agents amongst us do what is right and FREE ROBERT GREEN http://thetruthisnow.com/headlines/free-robert-green/ This submission has been entered into a contest to win 2 premium tickets + $500 for travel to see David Icke at Wembley Arena, London October 27, 2012.

"2009, The Washington Post The end of the Cold War left behind enough highly enriched uranium and plutonium in the former Soviet Union to build thousands of nuclear weapons. Stockpiles of chemical weapons and germ warfare facilities remained as well. For the past 18 years, the U.S. government has tried to secure these threats. A central figure in one operation, Project Sapphire, was Andy Weber, now assistant to the defense secretary for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs. This account, based on interviews and documents, is adapted from David E. Hoffman's 'The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy,' published this week by Doubleday. The 'Dead Hand' refers to a Soviet idea for a defense system that would retaliate even if the country's leaders were wiped out in a nuclear attack. ",1
"What is it? A high-stakes, high-school documentary series of quiet distinction. Why youâ€™ll love it: The mostly African-American seniors of Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School in South Carolina (or OW â€“ oh dubya â€“ for short) are followed by a British film crew in their final year. The next 12 months could change their lives but attendance is slipping, violence is a problem and some of the students have tough family situations. Watching this heart-tugging series in the context of Donald Trumpâ€™s impending presidency raises the stakes horribly. If some of these students started out at an arguable disadvantage, youâ€™re left to wonder what hope there is of social mobility in a country run by someone born to privilege with no understanding of struggle. Into the chaos comes new principal Stephen G Peters, one of those inspirational teachers who will not rest until he has shepherded every single one of them safely through the gates, prepared for what lies ahead.   Related: Last Chance U: is this the best sports documentary series of all time?   We have been spoiled with on-screen inspirational teachers in the UK thanks to several series of the excellent Educating â€¦ series (Essex, Yorkshire, etc), famous for their use of discreet camera rigs and the apparent naturalism that can offer. This is no different when it comes to access, but the students and teachers here are perhaps more aware of the cameras and it actually helps the narrative. At the start, the students are keen to perform, to be noticed and to leave their mark. The cool boys sneer and talk in soundbites: â€œThis ainâ€™t no fairytale,â€ says Rendull, the basketball captain who has just got his girlfriend pregnant. The way some of the participants try to mythologise their own stories in the early episodes gives way to something less guarded and more open as graduation day approaches. It feels as if the producers have played the long game here, spending time with their subjects over months, gaining their trust, putting them at ease. Vernon is the only male cheerleader at OW and, estranged from his mum since he came out as gay, he has moved in with best friend Breezy and her mother. But his dreams of college in New York are threatened by his inability to stay away from mischief. Sneaker-obsessed TJ is a regular high school dandy, always well turned-out and determined not to end up like his dad, who is currently serving time in prison. But his conviction that he will rise above expectations is at constant war with his own anger. And often, the anger wins. Assistant principal Dr Hall has built a special relationship with him but can she keep him on the path to graduation? Meanwhile, Jalena is aiming high and wants to become an engineer so she can ease the burden of debt on her single father. She applies to Ivy League colleges, full of hope and a resolve to do something good with her life. The relationships are incredibly touching but never schmaltzy. The show is a delicately filmed and edited thing, which keeps its distance and allows the emotion to speak for itself. Every participant is treated with careful, considered respect and the skill of the filmmaker (Marcus Plowright) is in drawing real feeling from their situations without resorting to head-patting sympathy. This is helped by Alexander Parsonsâ€™ impressive score, mixing tinges of the music the kids listen to with his own emotive arrangements. Six episodes of hope, just when itâ€™s needed. Where: BBC Three on iPlayer. Length: Six 45-minute episodes, four available now, with a new one every Tuesday. Stand-out episode: Episode two, in which we hear about Vernonâ€™s backstory and his friendship with Breezy. If you liked American High School, watch: Last Chance U (Netflix),  Educating Yorkshire (All 4), Friday Night Lights (DVD).",1
"  6.32pm BST  Summary  Itâ€™s not the vintage performance that Wenger would have wanted to crown his 20 years at Arsenal, but sometimes the performance doesnâ€™t matter. Thatâ€™s a massive three points for the Gunners, who are up to third, two points behind the leaders Manchester City.  How costly might that late goal prove for Burnley at the end of the season. They defended magnificently, and hit the bar from a corner, but ultimately come away with nothing. The defensive running from Boyd and Marney was relentless, and maybe it was that fatigue that proved decisive, Burnley mentally switched off for Arsenalâ€™s short corner.  The goal was controversial, beyond the allotted allocation of injury-time, Koscielny handled the ball into the net, and he was surely offside IF Oxlade Chamberlain kicked the ball into his team-mate. If he did, even with replays, it is still unclear if it was Koscielny kicked the ball into his own hand. Thierry Henry seems to think that it was Koscielny who kicked it into his own hand, and if anyone is a expert on late, handball goals, itâ€™s Thierry.

Remarkable.      6.08pm BST   77 min: Best ever two-footed striker? â€œIan Rushâ€, suggests Antonio Monterio Pais.  â€œâ€œSurely that embarrassment of riches is a hindrance in live playâ€ writes Marie Meyer. â€œI prefer the mental clarity of James Milner, who isnâ€™t going to let the fact he is now a left back deter him to shifting every single ball onto his right foot.â€  Updated at 6.10pm BST    6.05pm BST   75 min: Burnley hit the bar! From a corner, it is Michael Keane who climbs the highest, planting a powerful header against the underside of the bar. The ball pinballs around the Arsenal box for a moment, before it is eventually hacked clear. Keane scored from a corner against Watford on Monday, remember.     Keaneâ€™s effort hits the crossbar. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters    Updated at 6.08pm BST    6.04pm BST   72 min: With the ball swirling around high in the Lancashire winds, Sanchez judges a volley to perfection on the turn, his shot shooting not a yard wide of the post. Heaton was well beaten.      6.02pm BST   71 min: Arsenal subs: Iwobi is hooked, Oxlade Chamberlain on. Xhaka also makes way for Elneny.   Updated at 6.06pm BST    6.02pm BST   70 min: Some thoughts, courtesy of Matt Loten.  â€œOn a weekend when we have seen firsthand the success of some of the modern gameâ€™s most forward thinking managers - Kloppâ€™s Liverpool with their brand of gegenpressing and fluidity amongst forward players; Pochettinoâ€™s Spurs and their relentless energy, dynamism and ball-playing keeper - are we seeing here crystallised evidence of Arsene Wenger post-2005 tactical malaise? Sure, there have been the accusations of excessive thriftiness and blind faith in youth, but when I watch Arsenal I donâ€™t see any tactical innovation or flexibility. Instead, Wengerâ€™s gameplan seems to amount to little more than sending a group of technically-gifted players out onto the pitch with a vague instruction to pass the ball, and hoping that brilliance will naturally occur. I love the man for his great teams, and he was an innovator in his prime; now, though, Arsene seems to have been left in the shade by the relentless tactical evolution of Guardiola and his cohort of bright, youthful upstarts.â€ It does seem odd that for all Arsenalâ€™s good form, it takes just a couple of injuries to make them look one dimensional. Itâ€™s a good dimension, mind, but they still need some more diversity in the way that they can play. No doubt about that.      5.57pm BST   68 min: How long can Burnley keep this defensive running up? Not the full 90, I would guess. Prediction: 1-0 to Arsenal, Sanchez scoring in the 86th minute, capitalising on a tired Burnley defenderâ€™s mistake.      5.53pm BST   65 min: â€œSurely the all-time king of two-footedness is Andreas Brehme, writes Joel Dunmore. â€œHe was a left back and primarily left-footed but opted to take West Germanyâ€™s penalty in the 85th minute of the 1990 World Cup final with his right. Thatâ€™s confidence. According to Wikipedia, he felt that his right foot was more accurate and his left was more powerful. Nice â€˜problemâ€™ to have.â€  Updated at 5.54pm BST    5.52pm BST   63 min: Mesut Ozil should be subbed off â€“ Heâ€™s had a shocker today. Sanchez does well to get the ball wide to the German, who screws his cross high into the stands. Doesnâ€™t look interested today. Time for Oxlade-Chamberlain, perhaps? Burnley make a change: Scott Arfield on for Steven Defour.  Updated at 5.55pm BST    5.50pm BST   60 min: Burnley awaken! A swift counter-attack results in an excellent Gudmundsoon header at the back post, forcing Cech to tip the ball behind for a corner, from which Vokes glances a header towards the back post. It hits Hendrick, then Walcott, and Arsenal desperately hack it clear. Could have gone anywhere, that.     Vokes heads towards goal. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    Updated at 6.06pm BST    5.47pm BST   58 min: Chance for Ozil! Sanchez did well to find a pocket of space after a neat cut back from Monreal. Itâ€™s laid off for Ozil, and he sidefoots goalwards, but there is a fantastic block, I think from Mee, that diverts the ball away from danger.      5.45pm BST   56 min: Burnley havenâ€™t had a kick in about five minutes. Consistent Arsenal pressure, but without the presence of Olivier Giroud, Burnley seem content to sit deep and invite the crosses. Arsenalâ€™s lack of a plan B could come back to haunt them here.      5.42pm BST   53 min: I mentioned that I didnâ€™t rate Iwobi as much of a finisher, and heâ€™s just sent a shot out for a throw-in. Wenger slaps his knee in frustration, his face turning a shade of pink.  Updated at 5.42pm BST    5.39pm BST   51 min: Hendrick tries his luck from 40 yards. No dice.      5.38pm BST   48 min: Sanchez looks like the most likely Arsenal player to break the deadlock. First he picks the pocket of Boyd on the edge of Burnleyâ€™s area, then he collects a Bellerin tackle/pass/miscontrol and fires a low shot towards the near post. Heaton gets down well, and collects it at the second time of asking, with Walcott sniffing around for a rebound.     Sanchez goes round Keane.

Cazorla is running the show.      5.13pm BST   40 min: This, from Tim Daly. â€œI always thought Jeff Hendrick was a bit of a geezer, but have only just noticed the startling similarity between his haircut and the famous Sphinx of ahem...Gizaâ€     5.12pm BST   38 min: Vokes squanders the best chance of the match! Arsenal only half clear their lines, and as Lowton returns the ball to Arsenalâ€™s box with interest, Vokes is left completely unmarked, but heads wide from near the penalty spot. Bellerin was playing him onside.      5.09pm BST   36 min: Iwobi nutmegs Lowton with a sublime bit of skill. An Arsenal fan feints.      5.08pm BST   34 min: â€œIâ€™ve never understood how any player in the top leagues can get that far while being one-footed, but there have been quite a few,â€ emails Martin Wills.  Ozil and Xhaka are two good examples. The difference between their left and right is staggering. As it Burnleyâ€™s Gudmundsson, whoâ€™s had a good 34 minutes thus far. Left-footed players are particularly prone to being one-footed, I find.   Updated at 5.14pm BST    5.06pm BST   32 min: Conversely, Defour has been excellent, snapping at the heels of Cazorla and Xhaka, and has used the ball to good effect, finding Vokes on numerous occasions. He has been one of the signings of the seasons so far, and his goal against Hull City is a personal favourite this season. Itâ€™s easy to forget he was made captain of Standard LiÃ¨ge at just 19 years of age.      5.04pm BST   29 min: Ozil has been quiet, seems to be struggling with the physicality of Hendrick and Ward in particular.

Mustafi wins the battle, winning a throw, war TBC.     4.58pm BST   23 min: â€œIâ€™m more interested in Hendrickâ€™s tattoos than his hair. Heâ€™s got an anchor, which is interesting,â€ emails Michael Minihan. â€œEasy to forget in these days of people writing â€œdeterminationâ€ in Sanskrit just over their backside that there was a time when only sailors had tattoos.â€ Itâ€™s good, but itâ€™s nothing on Daniele De Rossiâ€™s.

This time the referee calls Mustafi over for a word, but the German defender insists that Vokes was backing in, and does a live demonstration on Craig Pawson, backing into the referee to comedic effect.  At 6ft tall, Mustafi is on the short side for a centre-back. Heâ€™s got his work cut out today against Vokes.      4.51pm BST   18 min: Is Cazorla the best two-footed player in the world?     4.49pm BST   16 min: Walcott smashes a cross-shot across the face of goal, but nobody is there at the back post to tap in an easy finish.      4.45pm BST   13 min: Mustafi fouls Vokes after long ball forward, part II    Mustafi fouls Vokes.

Iwobi has been simply brilliant in these past few weeks, but he doesnâ€™t strike me as a natural finisher. Everything is done with his instep. Still, itâ€™s a good one.      4.34pm BST   2 min: Throw-in to Arsenal, much to the frustration of Gudmundsson, who initially races towards the linesman to contest the decision, then stops himself.

Arsenal unchanged from the team that beat Basel, save for Cech replacing Ospina.  Burnley: Heaton, Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward, Gudmundsson, Hendrick, Marney, Defour, Boyd, Vokes. Subs: Flanagan, Kightly, Bamford, Robinson, Tarkowski, Arfield, Oâ€™Neill. Arsenal: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal, Xhaka, Cazorla, Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi, Sanchez. Subs: Gibbs, Gabriel, Ospina, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Holding, Reine-Adelaide, Elneny. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire)   Updated at 4.29pm BST    12.44pm BST  Preamble  Walcottâ€™s renaissance. That tackle from BellerÃ­n. That Xhaka chaps seems like a nice lad doesnâ€™t he. Wenger 4.0. Ozilâ€™s no-look pass. Iwobi, one for the future? One for right now more like! Yeah? Yeah! Who needs a traditional striker when youâ€™ve got SÃ¡nchez?  Itâ€™s the hope that kills you. But normally, Arsenalâ€™s fall from grace comes in February/March, their clutch of continental stars lagging at the lack of a winter break. October is traditionally the time when all is right with the world in N7, last season they won all five of their Premier/Champions League matches. But on the second day of this month, today feels like a day that Arsenal could stumble â€“ they have failed to win on two of their last three visits to Turf Moor.  Having already beaten Liverpool and Watford at home this season, Burnley are a team greater than the sum of its parts. They have a few individual stars â€“ Michael Keane has impressed at centre back and has already been linked with a big-money move away from the club, Andre Gray has looked every inch a Premier League striker, both Jeff Hendrick and Steven Defour shone since their summer moves to Lancashire â€“ but this is a team based on self-less sacrifice to a team effort. Only Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City have put in more miles than Sean Dycheâ€™s side this season.  Dyche will likely deploy the same five-man midfield which conquered Watford on Monday night, with Gray making way for Vokes to lead the â€˜attackâ€™. It will be tight, it might not be particularly pretty. George Boyd probably isnâ€™t going to skin Bellerin alive, but he will run and run and run and run and run. Dean Marney isnâ€™t going to dictate the play in the same way that Mesut Ozil might, but he is capable of delivering a decisive set-piece. It just feels like something could happen.

"Q. Many of the branches of the trees on my Upper West Side block have been cut, presumably for safetyâ€™s sake. Ditto my favorite Osage orange tree along the outer loop inside Central Park. Who decides which trees are a safety hazard? And who decides on the amount of cutting?A. The process of deciding who prunes New York City trees, and when, and why, all starts with a detailed count of the trees, said Jennifer Greenfeld, assistant commissioner for forestry, horticulture and natural resources with the New York City parks department.â€œEvery 10 years we do a census, with every tree on every street over five inches in diameter counted, so we know exactly how many trees there are, and can factor that into our tree-pruning budget,â€ Ms. Greenfeld said.This yearâ€™s budget is $5.5 million for the 592,130 trees in all five boroughs that were counted in 2005, she said. A census with an updated tree count was conducted in 2015 and was to appear last week; it was expected to include over 600,000 trees. (The census includes only trees that are planted on sidewalks and along streets, not the ones in parks.)The departmentâ€™s tree-pruning budget is primarily used to pay private tree-pruning companies â€” one in each borough â€” but that does not mean they can trim your favorite Osage or catalpa tree willy-nilly. â€œEach contractor has really detailed references for how to prune, and we have qualified arborists supervising the pruners,â€ Ms. Greenfeld said. â€œThe contractor also has to have a certified arborist on staff. And there are pretty much industry standards they all follow, but itâ€™s sort of part art and part science.â€Bough and branch clipping runs on a cycle: â€œThe way we look at it, you have an ideal pruning cycle, and in that ideal cycle every tree should get proactively pruned every seven to 10 years. For the last eight years, weâ€™ve achieved pruning on that seven-to-10-year cycle, usually closer to seven years.â€ But not all trees are shorn equally, and all are assessed before the saws and loppers come out.â€œWe deal with conflict, like if a tree is growing too close to someoneâ€™s house, and what we call â€˜structure,â€™â€ which takes into account the treeâ€™s age and how itâ€™s growing, she said.They also deal with concerned citizens. â€œAnytime somebody sees something we havenâ€™t caught, like falling limbs, we go out,â€ she said. â€œWe absolutely rely on the public calling in through 311 to let us know of emergencies or dangerous situations.â€What the parks department does not deal with are trees growing up into power lines. Ms. Greenfeld said that was Con Edisonâ€™s job.The trees on the Upper West Side block mentioned in the question were last pruned by the department in 2014, and no permits for tree work there have been issued since then.Ms. Greenfeld said that people were sometimes â€œconcerned weâ€™ve overpruned, or theyâ€™re concerned because they didnâ€™t know it was happening in advance,â€ but that the agencyâ€™s goals were usually aligned with the publicâ€™s: â€œWatching something grow in New York City is a pretty extraordinary thing for everyone.â€",1
"There was a time in the late 1960s when artistic vanguards joined forces: Andy Warhol produced an album with the Velvet Underground, the rock star John Lennon teamed with the conceptual artist Yoko Ono, and Norman Mailer tried his hand at experimental films.More obscurely, Thomas White, a 33-year-old American in Paris, produced a semi-improvised movie featuring members of the avant-garde Living Theater and a soundtrack by the free jazz exponent Ornette Coleman. A half-century after it was filmed on the bleak Belgian coast, that film, â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?,â€ has its belated New York premiere, this weekend at Anthology Film Archives.An anarchic rave with a wacky new-wave flavor, â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ opens on a bus that breaks down in the middle of nowhere. The passengers are psychiatric patients who, eluding their keepers, take refuge in a deserted building, haphazardly creating a new society complete with rituals that include a trial and a wedding.Mr. White, reached by phone this month at his home in Connecticut, said 10 hours of film were shot over 10 or 12 days. The scenario was based on the actorsâ€™ improvisation. â€œNobody told them what to do,â€ he said.Left to their own devices, the performers engage in breathing exercises, dress up in funny hats, play instruments, mill around, stage group hugs, make a mess, cook food, play with candles, stare into one anotherâ€™s eyes, break into primal screams and declaim poetry in beatnik rants that might have been recorded at an open mike at Cafe Wha? The polyrhythmic cascade of honks and squawks produced by Mr. Coleman, abetted by his sidemen â€” the bassist David Izenzon and the drummer Charles Moffett â€” imbue these activities with tremendous energy.For decades, the lone print of â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ gathered dust in Mr. Whiteâ€™s shed. The movieâ€™s digital resurrection follows the sleuthing of Vanessa McDonnell, a 35-year-old Brooklyn-based documentary filmmaker and jazz enthusiast. After Mr. Colemanâ€™s death in June, Ms. McDonnell set out to honor his memory with a film series at Spectacle, a Williamsburg microcinema. She found a truncated Vimeo version of the movie online and tracked down Mr. White. â€œHe wasnâ€™t terribly surprised,â€ she said.A sometime actor and musician with a rich social life, Mr. White worked as an assistant director on a Roger Vadim film; appeared (uncredited) as a â€œbeatnikâ€ in â€œThe Sandpiperâ€ (1965), a vehicle for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton partly shot in Paris; and lived a bohemian existence in the cityâ€™s Montparnasse district. The courtyard next to his apartment was, he recalled, a gathering place for visiting musicians, writers and artists. Among them were members of the Living Theater, which staged a production in Paris in late 1964.â€œThey were at loose ends,â€ Mr. White said. The troupe had arrived owing thousands of dollars in back taxes in the United States. That December, Julian Beck and Judith Malina, the married couple who founded the Living Theater, lost their legal appeal and had to return to America to serve brief prison terms; the rest of the company, some 25 actors and several small children, found temporary refuge in a North Sea farmhouse belonging to Antoine Allard, a wealthy pacifist and patron of the arts.While waiting for Mr. Beck and Ms. Malina to return, the actors amused themselves by making â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ According to John Tytellâ€™s 1995 book, â€œThe Living Theater,â€ the winter of 1964-65 was a period of â€œgreat duress.â€ There was little money for food, and cold weather froze the water pump, although hardship was eased and communal esprit facilitated by an abundance of hashish, among other drugs. The shortages and the exhilaration are both reflected in â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ Asked about the conditions under which his movie was made, Mr. White replied â€œthere was a lot of smoke in the room.â€â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ is something more than a stoned frenzy. Still, when the Mr. Beck and Ms. Malina returned to Europe later in 1965, they were not impressed. As Mr. White recalled, Mr. Beck told him that the movie was insufficiently serious and did not come from â€œthe same energy vector as the Living Theater.â€ Mr. White does not disagree. â€œThis was shtick to them,â€ he said of the actors. â€œThatâ€™s what the Becks objected to.â€After â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ had a poorly received premiere at the 1965 Locarno film festival in Switzerland, Mr. White decided to re-edit the movie and add a musical soundtrack. Several of his musician acquaintances were involved, including the singer-songwriter Nino Ferrer; the classical guitarist Ramon Ybarra; and a young British folk singer, Marianne Faithfull. Then, as fortuitously as he met the Living Theater, Mr. White encountered Ornette Coleman, who was touring Europe with his trio. Drawing on their repertoire, including the ballad â€œSadness,â€ sung in the film by Ms. Faithfull, the trio recorded a soundtrack. (One of the two sessions was surreptitiously documented by the British filmmaker Dick Fontaine, something Mr. White says he only recently learned.)Armed with an endorsement from the Surrealist painter Salvador DalÃ­, who saw â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ at a screening in Paris, Mr. White showed his film at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival market and at the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise, but plans to open the movie in London fell through, and Mr. White was unable to get distribution once he returned to the United States in 1968. (He thereafter made industrial films and commercials and worked as a film editor, ultimately retiring to breed horses.)â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ fell into obscurity. But because Mr. White sold the soundtrack to a French record producer, the project enjoyed a phantom existence among jazz enthusiasts â€” the original album was bootlegged and later released in a Japanese collectorâ€™s edition. For the critic Adam Shatz, who has written about free jazz and the French new wave, â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ showcases Mr. Coleman at a particularly productive period. The music â€œfeels rawer and edgier than Ornetteâ€™s classic quartet,â€ he told me. â€œItâ€™s the sound of freedom, really.â€In its semi-spontaneous revelry, even more than its theme, â€œWhoâ€™s Crazy?â€ expresses a kindred sense of liberation. Mr. White characterized making the film as â€œone of the best times I ever had.â€ The evidence is on the screen.",1
"When President Obama ended his nationally televised press conference by criticizing a Cambridge police sergeant for arresting a prominent Harvard University professor, Joan Van Dorn nearly jumped out of her seat in anger. 'I don't think it was the president's place to interfere,' Van Dorn said in Central Square Thursday afternoon. 'He's creating a racial divide, and I think it's totally inappropriate.' Obama's remark Wednesday night that Cambridge police 'acted stupidly' in arresting Henry Louis Gates Jr. ignited fierce reactions in this city. Many, including several police officers, bitterly denounced the president's remarks as inflammatory and ill-informed. Others, including African-Americans and Hispanics who said they have been victims of racial profiling, said the words were a badly needed wake-up call. On both sides, however, was the unsettling realization that a city that prides itself on its progressive politics and racial tolerance had been singled out by the country's first African-American president as an example of the limits on racial progress. Recalling previous racial controversies that have roiled the city - a $15 million racial bias suit against the Police Department settled in 1990, a 1999 controversy over the department instructing officers that pepper spray is less effective against Mexican-Americans, and a multimillion dollar award last year in a racial discrimination lawsuit against the city - many residents and officials said the incidents drive home a hard truth: Even in the People's Republic, racial lines and distrust persist. 'What the president said was right on,' said Daniel Klubock, a former judge who serves on the city's Human Rights Commission. 'When you're dealing with a sensitive racial situation, you have to know how to deal with it professionally. One would hope Cambridge would be better at this than other places, but there's no evidence that it is.' While few residents feared that the city's self-image would be permanently sullied by the controversy, many were uncomfortable that a liberal bastion known for condemning Bush administration policies and embracing illegal immigrants suddenly finds itself on what they believe to be the wrong side of the culture wars, its police force branded as racially insensitive on the highest stage. In bustling Central Square, many residents - black, white, and Hispanic - said they doubted that Gates's arrest had anything to do with skin color and said Cambridge's reputation for racial harmony was well deserved. 'The world is beating a path to Cambridge,' said Alann Zenowitz, who criticized Obama for siding with Gates while admitting he did not know all the facts. Citing Central Square's racial and ethnic diversity, the longtime resident said proudly that the city represented a kind of ideal. 'This is what America is all about,' he said. African-Americans, too, rushed to the city's defense, praising police as responsive and even-handed. 'They have a tough job,' said Ed Harris, a 52-year-old schoolteacher. 'If you're involved with the police, you need to be forgiving, because they don't know the full situation right when they arrive.' Still, in neighborhoods where Obama posters hang in windows months after the election, many took the president's critique to heart and said the city has a long way to go if it wants to live up to its professed liberal ideals. Richard Clarey, a longtime resident, said the jury's multimillion dollar award last year in a suit by Malvina Monteiro, a former city employee who accused city officials of racial discrimination, along with the current allegations suggest a pattern of poor treatment toward minorities. 'It shows an inability for city employees to put themselves in the position of Professor Gates or Mrs. Monteiro,' he said. 'It should result in the people who govern this city taking a closer look at how they treat people who don't look like themselves. But I don't think the city's heard the message yet.' Some said the liberal image has lulled city officials into a belief that racial problems do not exist. 'Because Cambridge enjoys a progressive reputation, it has not been forced to deal in a straightforward way with issues of race,' said Ellen Zucker, a former longtime resident and lawyer who represented Monteiro. 'The patina of progressive values that cover the city too often hides discrimination and retaliation.' Kathy Reddick, president of the Cambridge chapter of the NAACP, said the group will urge police to undergo sensitivity training and cultural education. Mayor E. Denise Simmons said that the city plans to continue previous discussions around the issues of class and race. 'It will take everyone working together to get to the issue of fairness and equity,' she said. Some African-Americans and Hispanics in Central Square welcomed Obama's assertion that 'race remains a factor in this society' and that discrimination 'still haunts us.' Paul Jean-Denis, 59, a cabdriver and longtime Cambridge resident who is originally from Haiti, said he believes that some officers have treated him with suspicion simply because of his skin color. 'If you're black, it's different,' he said. 'I think Obama knows this.' John Francis, 82, who remembers walking around the Capitol in his Army uniform after World War II, searching for a bathroom that would accept blacks, agreed with Obama that 'incredible progress has been made' in race relations. But much work remains, he said, even in enclaves touted for their tolerance. 'Police don't expect to see us in certain places, and they handle situations involving us differently,' Francis said. 'It happens every day, everywhere.' Still others said the arrest, for all the attention and controversy it has brought, was nothing more than a poorly handled confrontation. 'Both of them should have backed off a little,' said Robert Horton, 64, who is black. 'And Obama just added fuel to the fire.' ",1
"Proponents of the bill say it is too easy for minors and the inebriated to purchase alcohol illicitly by using the self check machines rather than the regular lines operated by a grocery clerk. It is a procedural move that will allow the bill to be considered at the start of the new legislative session in January without having to make its way past all the legislative committees again. Backers believe the bill by Assemblyman Hector De La Torre, a Democrat, easily has enough votes to pass in the Senate. This delay gives them time to lobby for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's support. 'The governor was intrigued by the legislation but wanted more information about how people can bypass the check out systems. I couldn't get it together before the recess,' said De La Torre, who placed the bill on hold late last week. The bill breezed through the Assembly this year over the objections of some large grocery chains. It has support from organizations fighting alcoholism and teen drinking, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Marin Institute as well as labor-allied community groups such as the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. California already forbids cigarettes, spray paint and some over-the-counter medications to be sold in self-service checkouts to make it tougher for minors to obtain them. De La Torre's bill would add beer, wine and spirits to that list. When a shopper buys alcohol, the devices are programmed to freeze the transaction until a clerk confirms the age of the buyer. But these safeguards failed or were ignored by supermarket staff almost 20 percent of the time, according to an April test of Southern California food stores by the University of California, Los Angeles' Community Economic Development Clinic and the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. If approved, the legislation also would have an outsize effect on Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market stores. That chain, which uses self-service checkout exclusively, would have to adjust its model or give up lucrative alcohol sales. Fresh & Easy is still working to defeat the bill. 'We are continuing to educate policymakers about the considerable efforts we have made, both in training and in our systems, to ensure alcohol is only sold to those who can legally purchase it,' said Brendan Wonnacott, a spokesman for the grocery chain. The major supermarket companies say that if the legislation passes, they will route customers purchasing alcoholic beverages through their regular check-out lines. Self-service check-out systems are growing in popularity. Shoppers run the items across a scanner and place them in a bag on an electronic scale. The machine checks to see whether the weight of the product matches what was scanned to keep customers honest. Consumers like the convenience, and supermarkets save on labor. ",1

"For the first time in the competitionâ€™s 17-year history, women will be allowed to compete at Mavericks, the nationâ€™s premier big-wave surfing contest, held off the northern coast of California.â€œThis is the pinnacle of the sport,â€ said Bianca Valenti, a San Francisco area surfer who expects to compete. â€œAnd this is progress. Iâ€™d like to see them grow the number of ladies in the event. But this is a good start.â€The one-day event, officially known as Titans of Mavericks, takes place south of San Francisco, half a mile off the rocky shores of Half Moon Bay, one of the worldâ€™s most dangerous surf breaks. The surfer Mark Foo died at the location in 1994, as did Sion Milosky in 2011.In the Titans, two dozen surfers attempt to ride massive swells that sometimes reach 60 feet.â€œMavericks is really dark and ominous,â€ Valenti said. â€œItâ€™s raw and rugged. Itâ€™s majestic. You can really feel the energy.â€The window for the event begins Tuesday and will run until March 31, depending on the development of prime surf conditions. Surfers are notified 24 hours before the event takes place.Organizers of Titans of Mavericks, owned and operated by Cartel Management, announced last week that the 2016-17 contest would feature a one-hour heat of six female surfers, who will compete for a $30,000 purse. Event organizers have not yet announced the field of surfers.â€œTitans can be men or women,â€ Cartelâ€™s chief operations officer, Brian Waters, said of the contest, which was once named Men Who Ride Mountains.For organizers, the decision to add women involved timing and logistics, according to Waters, who started running the competition three years ago.It was not just the logistics of fog, wind, temperature and swells, but also having enough female big-wave surfers to compete, he said.â€œNow thereâ€™s more female big-wave surfers that are charging,â€ he said. â€œThis is the right time to do this.â€But the decision to add women to the roster also came after the Committee for Equity in Womenâ€™s Surfing began lobbying the California Coastal Commission, which oversees public beach access and grants competition permits.â€œThe ocean does not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity or sexuality,â€ the committee said in a September letter proposing the addition and competition specifics. The letter was signed by four big-wave surfers in the area: Valenti, Paige Alms, Keala Kennelly and Andrea Moller.â€œEven if Mavericks has a right to exclude women in the abstract, it probably does not have the right to use public resources for its exclusionary activities,â€ a lawyer for the group said in a legal memo to the commission.Last year, the commission granted Mavericks a one-year permit on the condition that future events include female surfers, a commission spokeswoman, Noaki Schwartz, said.Mavericks organizers and the commission are scheduled to meet Wednesday to formalize that agreement before granting the event further permits.Sabrina Brennan, who heads the San Mateo County Harbor Commission, which manages the Mavericks surf area, helped in the fight to include women â€” which at times grew tense.â€œOrganizers would show up at meetings with their attorneys and just stare at you with a menacing look,â€ said Brennan, who is also a member of the Committee for Equity in Womenâ€™s Surfing. â€œIt was intimidating.â€She also said some event organizers had told several female surfers to get their own Mavericks event.Still, Brennan said she was pleased with the outcome.â€œItâ€™s about time,â€ she said. â€œIt feels like it shouldnâ€™t have taken this long. And I wonder why itâ€™s taken so long. Itâ€™s exciting and thrilling. But weâ€™re not there yet. Women athletes have to keep asking for what they want.â€The World Surf League also announced in April that it would introduce a womenâ€™s championship event on its big-wave tour.More women have entered big-wave surfing as the sport has grown over the past 10 years, thanks to recent developments in inflatable emergency flotation and increased attention to emergency medical preparedness, said Ashton Goggans, the editor of Surfer magazine.â€œThat women would be among those growing numbers shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise,â€ he said. â€œThat itâ€™s taken this long for them to be given a space to demonstrate their ability should.â€Female surfers have proved formidable. Last year Kennelly took home the Barrel of the Year Award at the Billabong XXL Awards, beating out hundreds of male competitors during the most active big-wave season in history.â€œI think this is a big win for womenâ€™s surfing, womenâ€™s sports and women in general,â€ Kennelly said. â€œTitans are a little late to the party, but I say better late than never.â€",1
"Premier We Den-yih said Sunday that the Dec. 22 revocation of the operating license of a local TV channel has not been finalized but will depend on the ruling of an administrative appeal. The premier's response to the case came after the National Communications Commission (NCC) decided not to renew the license for ERA TV's entertainment channel over repeated violations of the Satellite Broadcasting Act by including embedded advertorials. The decision is not settled but needs to go through legal proceedings to decide whether the NCC's move was completely appropriate, Wu said after attending a folk ritual in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan. Asked whether the NCC was too arbitrary in its first such move since its establishment in 2006, the premier said he is not in a position to comment on a decision made by an independent body. ",1
"Ben Roethlisberger was back in the starting lineup on Sunday, looking sharp after sitting out Pittsburgh's game last week because of a concussion. He didn't appear to miss a step: he completed 18 of 24 passes for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns. Twice he led the Steelers on scoring drives in response to Oakland touchdowns. In the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger called his own number and ran for 8 yards. A play later, he hit Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown. His standout play was not enough. Pittsburgh lost its fourth consecutive game, 27-24, on a last-minute touchdown pass by Oakland's Bruce Gradkowski. But the story of this game, and for the entire NFL season, was the league's efforts -- driven by intense news-media scrutiny -- to deal with the scourge of concussions and the violence that produces them. One can make the argument that for the second week in a row, Pittsburgh fell victim to the league's recent preoccupation with concussions. Last week, Roethlisberger, after practicing all week, was held out of an important game against Baltimore. And Sunday's game against Oakland was seemingly affected by a call that reflects the league's new sensitivity -- some call it an obsession -- with head injuries and unnecessary violence. With Oakland driving for the winning touchdown, trailing 24-20 in the fourth quarter, Gradkowski fired a pass in the end zone for Johnnie Lee Higgins. The pass was broken up, and the rookie cornerback Ryan Mundy leveled Higgins for good measure. Last year -- perhaps six weeks ago -- Mundy's hit would have been regarded as a good, hard football play. But Mundy was called for unnecessary roughness. Two plays later, Gradkowski hit Louis Murphy for a game-winning 11-yard touchdown pass. After the game, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin was asked about the critical penalty. 'That's today's NFL,' Tomlin said. 'The official thought it was unnecessary, so he threw the flag.' The tone of Tomlin's answer reflected the mounting frustration of coaches and players as the NFL attempts to make an inherently brutal game safe. The league wants to reduce head injuries without removing the essential ingredient that attracts fans to football in the first place: its violence. This is mission impossible with players and coaches caught in the middle. 'This game is already a violent sport,' Hines Ward said Sunday night as he left the Steelers' somber locker room. Ward found himself in the middle of controversy last week after he appeared to criticize Roethlisberger for not playing against Baltimore. Roethlisberger was not cleared by Pittsburgh's doctors after complaining of postpractice headaches during the week before the game. In an interview with Bob Costas before the Steelers played the Ravens, Ward described how he got around that by sometimes lying to team doctors in order to be allowed to play. During the interview, Ward, speaking of the Ravens game, said, 'It's almost a must-win,' and said he could see why some of Roethlisberger's teammates might wonder why he didn't force the issue. 'So, it's almost like a 50-50 toss-up in the locker room,' Ward said then. 'You know, should he play, shouldn't he play? It's really hard to say.' After Sunday's loss, Ward said he was more upset with the process: Why allow Roethlisberger to practice all week, then decide on Saturday he wouldn't play? The NFL has a larger issue, and that's how to sanitize a game whose essential appeal is full-speed mayhem and violence. A game predicated on reflex and reaction cannot become rehearsed and hesitant. 'You can't go out there and play like that,' Mundy said Sunday. He acknowledged the NFL's effort to protect players, 'but it's a very fine line, especially once you add the financial aspects.' Mundy, who could be fined $15,000 for the foul, said: 'That's something you got to think about, but not when you're on the field. This is a game we've been playing all our lives. It's based off of reaction, so you don't have time to think.' How can players satisfy the NFL's tighter rules to ensure safety while playing with intimidating aggressiveness and passion? 'I would get criticized if I didn't go in there and make a play for my team,' Mundy said. 'They'd say, 'Oh, he's soft,' or 'He's not aggressive.' You definitely don't want that reputation, so you got to keep playing.' Ward reinforced Mundy's point. 'You don't want to be looked down upon for not being a physical guy,' Ward said. 'At the same time, the league is coming down trying to make the game safer. But how can you make football safe? The two words don't go hand in hand. This is a violent sport.' On Sunday, the Steelers, perhaps because of the league's new emphasis on safety first, were all but knocked out of playoff contention. ",1

"Maria Sharapova will be reinstated as a UN goodwill ambassador when her suspension from tennis expires next April, the Guardian has learned.  The UN Development Programme, which works to eradicate poverty and inequality, discontinued its nine-year relationship with the Russian in March after she admitted taking the prohibited substance meldonium at this yearâ€™s Australian Open. Sharapova was subsequently banned for two years by an International Tennis Federation tribunal, but an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport resulted in a reduced suspension of 15 months, paving the way for Sharapova to return to competitive action before the French Open in May.    Related: UN suspends Maria Sharapova as goodwill ambassador   The five-time grand slam champion was swift to re-enter the public arena following the verdict, appearing at an Aids charity event in Las Vegas a week later, and her readmission to the UN fold is likely to accelerate her rehabilitation further. Several major sponsors who put promotional deals on hold when Sharapova was initially suspended have since resumed relations with her, Nike and Evian among them. But while those decisions will have been shaped by commercial considerations, UN goodwill ambassadors are appointed on the basis that they are â€œpersons of integrityâ€ who â€œpossess the personality and dignity required for such high-level representative capacityâ€.  â€œUNDP was glad to learn that Maria Sharapova can return to the sport she loves sooner than expected and we will lift the suspension of her role as our goodwill ambassador once the reduced ban expires in April 2017,â€ said a spokesperson for the organisation.  â€œWe understand that Ms Sharapova will be focused on resuming her tennis career and we look forward to discussing her role and engagement with UNDP at an appropriate date.â€ The UNâ€™s softened stance, doubtless made easier by the lifting of sponsor suspensions, marks a significant upturn in the fortunes of an athlete whose career was thrown into jeopardy by her admission that she had taken meldonium, a drug that increases blood flow, for a decade. The substance, which Sharapova said she took due to a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes, was added to the World Antiâ€‘Doping Agencyâ€™s banned list on 1 January. Article 17 of the UN guidelines for the designation of goodwill ambassadors stipulates that they must â€œRefrain from any activity incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nationsâ€. Article 32 warns that the arrangement will be terminated if the ambassador â€œengages in any activity incompatible with his/her status or with the purposes and principlesâ€ of the organisation.  Despite suspending Sharapova, the UNDP left the door open for a rapprochement by expressing its gratitude for the former world No1â€™s support and stressing that her activities were being put on ice pending the outcome of her case.  With a Cas panel having determined that her transgression was â€œnot about an athlete who cheatedâ€, it appears the 29-year-old will now be free to resume what she hailed on her appointment in 2007 as one of her â€œproudest contracts everâ€. The position earned Sharapova a symbolic $1 salary, a modest addition to the glut of highly lucrative contracts that, prior to her ban, made her the worldâ€™s highest-paid female athlete for 11 successive years until she was deposed by Serena Williams this year.      Maria Sharapova embraces recording artist Sir Elton John, left, at an October charity event in Nevada benefiting the Elton John Aids Foundation. Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images   Sharapova was selected largely on the strength of her charity work on behalf of survivors of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a cause close to her heart. Her parents fled the Belarusian city of Gomel, about 80 miles north of Chernobyl, when her mother fell pregnant with the future Wimbledon champion a few months after the worldâ€™s worst nuclear accident.  Sharapova marked her initial appointment as a goodwill ambassador by donating $100,000 (Â£80,471) to help young survivors in rural communities affected by the disaster, and has established a charitable foundation to help recovery efforts. Last month, Sharapovaâ€™s racket sponsor was widely condemned for celebrating news of her reduced ban. But Steve Simon, head of the Womenâ€™s Tennis Association, believes she has paid her dues in lost earnings and ranking points â€“ having not played since January, she no longer holds a world ranking â€“ and it would seem that view is shared by the UN.

"Excitedly pushing past each other as they gathered around the slightly soggy pile, a group of overjoyed local fifth-graders came across several perfectly good naked ladies lying right in the woods behind the baseball field, sources confirmed Tuesday. Whoa! Look at all of themyou can see everything! said wide-eyed 11-year-old Joshua Goldstein as he knelt down to closely inspect each one of the fully nude young women lying in a haphazard heap on the ground, before turning his attention to a large-breasted one left draped over a log. Sure, theyre a little dirty, and a couple of them look like theyre from the 70s, but after we dry them off theyll be perfect. Theyre still in pretty good shape! Who would just leave them lying out here like this? After concluding that their mothers might discover the nude women if they brought them home, the boys reportedly decided to tuck the naked ladies under some bushes and come back to look at them later.

"NGOs: Choice Tool of Subversion for the New World OrderBy Makia Freeman On the surface, NGOs appear as benign, helpful and, at the very worst, harmless creatures which do work that promotes the betterment of humanity. Many of them do perform philanthropic work; however, others are created and controlled right from the start to be nothing more than instruments of infiltration and influence influence which is highly unwanted in the targetnation. These latter kind of NGOs are a manifestation of US-NWOsoft power by which the US can manipulate and dominate a country without having to fire a single bullet. This subterfuge was working very well for awhile, but now in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukraine coup and other events, nations are beginning to wake up to the trickery and are passing laws restricting or forbidding NGOs on their turf. The fact that numerous nations such as Israel, China, India, Russia and othershave passed laws against foreign NGOs gives you some idea of how powerful NGOs have become. In July 2016, Israel passed a law requiring foreign NGOs to declare the source oftheir funding. The introduction of the law read: The law wishes to deal with the phenomenon of NGOs which represent foreign interests of foreign states, while acting under the cover of local organizations seeking to serve the interests of the Israeli public; and IsraeliPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the laws goal was to prevent an absurd situation in which foreign states meddle in Israels internal affairs by funding NGOs, without the Israeli public being aware of it. In April2016,China passed a lawrequiring foreignNGOs to register with, and be approved by, their Government. In March 2015, India banned 69 NGOs from receiving foreign contributions. Earlier in December 2012, Russia passed a law that was specifically targeted against US NGOs operating inside Russia. Some of the provisionsfrom the law are: So why are so many countries all of a sudden getting so scaredof NGOs? The answer lies in the power of NGOs to influence public thought and stealthily disseminate propaganda that can cause people to lost faith in their politicians,overthrow governments and induce a nation to make poor decisions that benefit the funder of the NGOs, usually the US. Take a look at George Soros colossal network of NGOs, which include the NED (National Endowment for Democracy) and NDI (National Democratic Institute). As Eric Draitser notes in his articleChinas NGO Law: Countering Western Soft Power and Subversion: Human Rights Watch, and the NGO complex at large, hascondemnedChinas Overseas NGO Management Law because they quite rightly believe that it will severely hamper their efforts to act independently of Beijing. However the reality is that they act as a de facto arm of western intelligence agencies and governments, and they have played a central role in the destabilization of China in recent years. The oft touted leader of Occupy Central was a pro-Western academic named Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. Though he presented himself as the leader of a grassroots mass movement, Mr. Tai has for years been partnered with the NDI, a nominal NGO which is actually directly funded by the US State Department via the NED Tai[andother Chinese]each act as the public face of a US Government-sponsored initiative to destabilize the political situation in Hong Kong, one of Chinas most economically and politically important regions. Through the intermediary of the NGO, Washington is able to promote an anti-Beijing line under the auspices of democracy promotion, just as it has done everywhere from Ukraine to Venezuela. The horrible Ukrainian coup of 2014could not have been pulled off without the help of Soros and his NGOs. Vicky Nuland told us that the US pumped $5 billion into regime change there.William Jasper notes: Many of the participants in Kievs EuroMaidan demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by SorosInternational Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given more than any other donor organization to democratic transformation of Ukraine. Earlier in May 2016, Vanessa Beeleyreported thatthe so-called White Helmets NGO was actually a US and UK government-funded first responder organization in Syria shown to have deep ties to al-Nusra Front as well as links to ISIS, and it operates exclusively within terrorist-held areas in Syria, including participation in executions. Did you catch that? Participations in executions? Links to the US-Uk-Israeli controlled pet Frankenstein ISIS?I suppose this NGOmatches the humanitarian bombings carried out by NATO against innocent civilians in Libya and other Middle Eastern countries NGOs are running amok. We dont just have NGOs; we have an actual NGO complex which is controlled by the New World Order and is part of their psychological operations and perception management department. It ensures that American democracy and humanitarian interventions (both doublespeak oxymorons) are coated with sugar togo down well. Often, they hide behind the excuse of furthering human rights as a way to justify their subversive operations.Patrick Henningsen wrote an excellent article in April 2016 entitledAN INTRODUCTION: Smart Power The Human Rights Industrial Complex which spells out the way these NGOs operate: Shaping western public perception and opinion on major international issues is essential if major world powers are to realise their foreign policy goals. Not surprisingly, we can see that many of the public positions taken by NGOs are exactly aligned with western foreign policy. In theBalkansWarof the 1990s, human rights groups supported partitioning. In the Ukraine in 2014 and with both Syria and Yemen in 2016 they supported regime change. In each instance NGOs function as a public relations extension to a United Nations western member Security Council bloc, namely the US, UK and France. This collusion is manifest throughout the upper echelons of these organizations whose streamlined agenda conforms through a lucrative revolving door which exists between a cartel of western NGOs, government and media. The role of NGOs and human rights organizations has been pivotal in Syria, to provide cover for the US to carry out its clear intention of regime change: By framing the Syrian Conflict (2011 to present) as a civil war, both western media and human rights organizations did their part in propping-up an important western foreign policy narrative. Inaccurate and distorted, this narrative has helped shield the US-led clandestine proxy war [but the reality is]a US-backed guerrilla war where Washington and Ankara, along with NATO and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) allies, flooding Turkey and Syria with weapons, cash, equipment, social media teams, military trainers and foreign fighters from as a far away as Pakistan. NGOs are responsible for all those feel-good petitions that totally misinform Westernersabout some poor country that is about to get invaded, whip up misdirected outrage and persuade people to get in line withthe exact militarygoals the US has already planned? Have you noticed how may NGOs call for No Fly Zones, Buffer Zones or Safe Zones?Remember the phony Stop Kony 2012 campaign? Remember how George Soros Avaaz called for a No Fly Zone in Libya, to help US-NATO assassinate Gaddafi and control Libya? A lot of people aregetting played like a fiddle Pumping money into foreign countries for regime change, or manipulating foreign elections for leadership change, is an old game that the CIA and branches of theUS Government have been playing for decades. The game is nothing new; its only the style that has changed. NGOs are the velvet glove on the iron fist, carrying out the dirty subversive work of the NWO but making it look like roses. Fortunately, many nations targeted by this rank infiltration have noticed the threat and taken appropriate measures to defend their culture, laws, stability and way of life.

"I meet Jamie Oliver on his first morning back at work after he has become, at 41, a dad for the fifth and, he insists, final time. Heâ€™s spent the weekend co-hosting his annual Big Feastival at friend Alex Jamesâ€™s farm in Oxfordshire. Itâ€™s nine in the morning outside a photographerâ€™s studio in north London and Oliver suggests we sit on a junked sofa in the sun, apologising if he sounds a bit groggy â€“ blame wife Joolsâ€™s heroic efforts to get three-week-old River Rocket on to a â€œhybrid Gina Ford regimeâ€, and his DJ stint in Feastivalâ€™s cheese tent the day before, where he shared billing with Tinie Tempah and the Proclaimers. Despite his apologies, he need never really fret about losing his focus. Once he starts talking, all the familiar Essex energy kicks in, and after a rare month away from it, he is back doing what he does best: evangelising compulsively about good food. I spent some time with Oliver for OFM four years ago, and got a sense of the full, plate-spinning frenzy of the life he had so cheerfully made for himself: the spread of his school-dinner initiatives to 80 countries, his plans for a global restaurant empire to fund his food standards work, his stand-offs with processing factories and governments on four continents, his initiative to bring cooking skills into the classroom and into impoverished adult lives â€“ not to mention his inevitable latest book and TV show. Back then, I was impressed by his ambition and heart, but also feared a little that he would never be able to keep it all going. Talking to him now, it seems Oliver has responded to those spread-himself-too-thinly challenges in two ways. Firstly, by becoming a bit smarter in how he manages his time. And secondly, by trying to learn from every scrap of campaigning experience he has picked up since he first stopped being the cheeky chappie Naked Chef and opened Fifteen, his social enterprise restaurant, in 2002. It doesnâ€™t mean he is doing any less, though. The last year has seen Jamieâ€™s Italian grow to 64 restaurants across the world. He has been to South Korea and Greece and Costa Rica in search of the secrets of longevity for his Super Food series, and he has almost singlehandedly put the problems associated with sugar at the top of the UK public-health agenda, culminating in former chancellor George Osborne including a revolutionary sugar tax in his final budget. Oliver is proud of all of these things, he tells me, in the morning sunshine, but at the moment he is proudest of all of improving the lives of 46 million Brazilian chickens. If there has been a change in his approach, he says, it is a focus on measurable outcomes rather than the uncertainties of protest. His work with the Brazilian poultry producer Sadia, which farms a staggering 18% of all the worldâ€™s chickens, is a case in point. Oliver has a strong profile in Brazil from his TV shows and he was approached by the food processing giant to see if he would do a marketing campaign. Sadia may have thought they were signing up to a brand endorsement, a bit of culture change and some warm words; in fact, Oliver insists, itâ€™s never that simple. He has become expert in knowing how this corporate dance works. â€œWe paint them this beautiful picture of what good could look like,â€ he says, of his methods. â€œAnd then we make it clear that if you want to do business with us, it is going to be extremely awkward for you.â€   Related: Jamie Oliver says PM's obesity strategy has let down every UK child   Sadia, like all the companies Oliver works with â€“ including big supermarket chains in Canada and Australia â€“ had to sign up to a complex programme his team has developed over 10 years called Josie; the Jamie Oliver Supplier Information Exchange. It effectively monitors the supply chain from e-numbers to additives to mechanically reclaimed meat and animal welfare. â€œSadia had to hit all of the welfare points before we put our name to it,â€ he says, â€œand we monitor their promises closely.â€ The contract is worth a reported Â£11.5m, though Oliver doesnâ€™t expect to see any of the money personally. â€œBeyond keeping our commercial cogs moving, the money doesnâ€™t matter to me any more. What does is that this is the best bit of agricultural work I have done.â€ What does it mean for the Brazilian chickens? â€œWhen we started to look, the standards were lower than Red Tractor standards in the UK,â€ he says, â€œbut still safe and legal. Now they have natural light, we have changed stocking density so there is much less cannibalism, much less disease, all these things. The chickens are at RSPCA Freedom Food standards, which is the best scalable model. But, above all, it creates a welfare story in a country that doesnâ€™t have one.â€ Oliver has learned to love the simple magic of making small changes at scale. â€œYou can do the street food and farmersâ€™ markets and Feastivals,â€ he says, â€œand thatâ€™s beautiful. The question for me now, though, is about how many of these standards can you get into all food production â€“ then that becomes an incredible story.â€ His gift for telling those kinds of stories has long been amplified across multiple platforms. Instagram is his favourite â€“ â€œitâ€™s a nicer space than Twitter â€“ itâ€™s much harder to be mean-spirited and angry in pictures than wordsâ€. And the sheer immediacy of the message doesnâ€™t cease to amaze him. As a case in point, the previous week heâ€™d come up with a neat little invention, a one-egg omelette for his daughter Petalâ€™s breakfast, cooked quite fiercely in a large pan and with just a few crumbs of cheddar and a pinch of pepper and then rolled like a little scarf and added to a piece of toast. He thought it a thing of beauty â€“ â€œthe proteins were so blondâ€ â€“ called it a â€œsilky omeletteâ€ and posted the â€œrecipeâ€ on Instagram. A day later it had received 2.5 million views and counting. He has become an instinctive connoisseur of media and messages. â€œI know now if I write something slightly wrong it doesnâ€™t go viral but if I spend a bit of time getting it right, it goes nuts.â€ (That power, for better and worse, is demonstrated a couple of weeks after we meet when Oliver succeeds in â€œuniting the Spanish nation against himâ€ in so-called â€œPaellagateâ€)    Jamie Oliver promoting Food Revolution Day in 2015. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images   In the early Channel 4 days when journalists used to sit Oliver down and ask what he was up to, heâ€™d say, â€œIâ€™m the British food ambassador.â€ If that sounded bolshie, what he meant was heâ€™d be on all these talk shows around the world, Jay Leno, Letterman, and every single time they would start with a gag about how bad British food was. â€œI would spend the first third of the interview arguing it was really not shit,â€ he says, â€œand then try to cook something great to prove the point.â€ These days, the ambassadorial boast is not an idle one. For the sugar tax announcement, he was at the World Health Assembly in Geneva and the health ministers from 156 countries were there listening. â€œWithout sounding too pompous, I gave George [Osborne], bless him, the narrative,â€ he says, â€œthe whole medical story, the health data. But still, George was brave enough to do it. And he won himself the ovations for it.â€ Oliver is less hopeful about the new government â€“ one of Theresa Mayâ€™s first acts as prime minister was to dilute the â€œobesity strategyâ€ that had been all but signed off by the Cameron government. â€œI want her to succeed,â€ Oliver says. â€œBut it was a terrible start. I will probably see her in a month and she will tell me the reasons why she compromised so much she turned something of value for the nationâ€™s health into something of no value whatsoever.â€ And then his fight will start again. I have a sense that he is more accepting of his vocation these days, having passed 40. Would it be fair to say that what seemed a bit like a burden now weighs less heavily since he has realised it is a lifelong commitment? â€œAbsolutely. You can guarantee that. I am not going anywhere. When I did the sugar campaign I never thought I would get the tax so quickly. But I thought I could get it eventually. We are always trying to plan further ahead. We really want to think more strategically, but to be honest we havenâ€™t yet got beyond kick, bollock, scramble.â€ Heâ€™s been spending a bit of time in the past couple of years with people over 100 years old, trying to learn their diet secrets. The thing that he has taken away is a very clear sense that it is not how long you live but how well you live that counts.   When I did the sugar campaign I never thought I would get the tax so quickly. But I thought I could get it eventually   â€œI hung out in Korea with a 117-year-old woman,â€ he says, with a laugh. â€œI remember very clearly the first time I touched a 100-year-old, if that doesnâ€™t sound weird. Itâ€™s hard not to respect all that life. And Iâ€™d be asking my questions â€¦ Two eggs every day? What oils do you use? All that.â€ Has he been struck by a sense of his own mortality, turning 40? â€œTo be honest, I have always been quite sentimental about that stuff,â€ he says. â€œIt goes back to family, to Essex. Despite all that Iâ€™ve learned, my general litmus is, if I am honest with myself, gut feeling. I have always known the things that we have tried that would go pear. They never felt right.â€ Where does he think that gut feeling for what will work, what will seduce and engage people, comes from? â€œSomewhere in there is the experience of growing up in a pub,â€ he says. â€œI still think a good pub is the most democratic place in the world. We had businessmen, Gypsies, farmers, pensioners, teenagers, whatever, all talking.â€ He canâ€™t help thinking the gift of understanding that dynamic is in his blood. â€œWhen I set up Fifteen,â€ he says, â€œwhich is one of the best things I have done, it was like I felt I had to. My dad only ever earned a hard quid, and then, at 20-odd, his son lucks out and sells all these books. I spent it all on Fifteen and I was really close to bankruptcy. In the back of my mind was my great-great grandfather who kept the Ten Bells on Spitalfields market â€“ and did a soup kitchen on the side for recent immigrants, Portuguese Jews and whatever. In my romantic way I like to think that is deep within me. You canâ€™t run a good pub without caring about the whole community, the whole village â€¦â€ And, he might add, the whole wide world. ",1
"New Study Finds GM Corn and Roundup Causes Cancer In RatsSayer Ji, Contributor This study, therefore, was performed in light of this need, and the results were an unprecedented confirmation of the cancer-causing effects of GM food and agrichemicals, reported as follows: In females, all treated groups died 23 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls, the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by GMO and Roundup treatments. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.55.5 times higher. This pathology was confirmed by optic and transmission electron microscopy. Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.32.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600 days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76% of the altered parameters were kidney related. These results can be explained by the non linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, but also by the overexpression of the transgene in the GMO and its metabolic consequences. [emphasis added] GMO plants actually incorporate glyphosate directly into themselves, with the herbicide residues and their metabolites persisting there, making dual exposure to transgenes and herbicide inevitable, and the synergistic amplification of their toxicities likely. It is a shameful fact of history that Roundup herbicide was once marketed by its creator and original patent holder, Monsanto, as being safe as table salt. Now, an accumulating body of research shows that glyphosate, Roundups active ingredient, is genotoxic and endocrine disrupting both hallmark characteristic of many carcinogens at concentrations several orders of magnitude concentration lower than agricultural application. In fact, Monsanto has gone to great lengths to deny the emergingRoundup-Cancer link by pouring money into contract research companies like Exponent, who deny its well established harms. This newest study provides clear and convincing evidence that GMO agriculture is contributing to cancer in exposed populations. The timing of this new study two weeks before Breast Cancer Awareness Month (BCAM) is all the more fitting, considering that In female animals, the largest tumors were in total 5 times more frequent in males after 2 years, with 93% being mammary tumors. They also observed a strikingly marked induction of mammary tumors by R[oundup] aloneeven at the very lowest dose administered. The annual pinkwashing campaign focuses on equating prevention with early detection by exposing womens bodies to breast cancer-causing x-rays, rather than to identify and remove the preventable causes, e.g. chemical exposure, carcinogenic foods, of breast cancer. The precautionary principle requires that if there is indication in a non-human study that a chemical is toxic to those who are forced to ingest it, inhale it, or otherwise be exposed to it, the burden of proving it safe must be on those manufacturing, marketing it and/or releasing it into the environment. For too long has America albeit, unbeknownst to most of the population been engaged in a mass chemical and feeding experiment, without the protection of informed consent, or even the right to know what it is eating through truthful labeling of GMOs. Please help to spread this information far and wide, and to further garnish support for Californias Proposition 37 (Just Label It), which could turn the tide against GM agricultures systemic destruction of the biosphere, and by implication, our health.

"Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu has urged local authorities to keep flood casualties and losses to minimum and to launch reconstruction work in a timely and orderly way. Hui was speaking during an inspection of flood-affected areas in Weinan and Shangluo cities in north China's Shaanxi Province from Aug. 2 to 3. He visited affected residents, as well as soldiers who were fighting the floods, saying the flood work had entered a crucial stage. Since mid July, many areas in Shaanxi Province have seen continuous rain, leading to frequent natural disasters, such as floods, mountain torrents and mud-rock flows. Continuous rainstorms caused mud-rock flows in Zhulinguan Village of Danfeng County, Shangluo city, on July 23 and 24. Hui visited the village and urged officials to address food, drinking water, clothing and housing issues. He also called for the repair of roads and resumption of water and electricity supplies as soon as possible. Homes, schools and hospitals should be reconstruction priorities, he said. Meteorologists forecast higher than average rainfall this month along the province's Hanjiang and Weihe rivers. Hui ordered local governments to intensify flood warnings, improve response plans, reinforce reservoirs and river embankments and replenish emergency materials, so as to be well prepared for more rain and floods.

"Last year, Kevin Johns, a construction worker in the Bronx, did his taxes at the H&R Block store on Riverdale Avenue that he had used for the past 20 years or so. The next day, though, he got a call from the tax preparer: His return was rejected because he had already filed. Or at least, someone had filed in his name. That someone helped himself or herself to a $8,499 refund. Sharon Hawa, a disaster-relief coordinator with the Red Cross and another longtime customer at the same office, had a similar experience. Hawa said she went to have her taxes done, only to be told that someone had already e-filed her taxes and collected $6,145. Both Hawa and Johns said they were told by police detectives investigating their cases that at least 20 customers of the branch and possibly many more had been robbed by identity thieves who were very likely H&R Block employees. Both said the fraudulent filers used their previous year's adjusted gross incomes as proof of identity. 'There's only place that could have come from: H&R Block,' Johns said. On Thursday, lawyers for Johns and Hawa filed a class-action suit in the Bronx, accusing the company of failing to take steps to protect its customers' security despite previous allegations (and lawsuits filed in Arizona, Illinois and Michigan) against other H&R Block outlets. The suit came on the same day, coincidentally, that federal prosecutors announced fraud charges against 26 tax preparers from the Bronx, Manhattan and New Jersey -- none from H&R Block -- accused of collecting tens of millions of dollars in refunds through identity theft over a nine-year period. At the H&R Block storefront at 3736 Riverdale Ave., in Kingsbridge, employees said they could not talk to a reporter. H&R Block, the nation's biggest tax-preparation company, with more than 12,000 offices, said in a statement: 'H&R Block is working directly with the IRS and other authorities to resolve this situation for clients. We are standing by our clients and will do everything we can to assist them. So that we don't compromise the efforts of the IRS, we aren't able to share additional details at this time.' The police said the cases of Hawa and Johns had been referred to the Internal Revenue Service, which declined to comment, citing taxpayer confidentiality rules. In Indiana, two former H&R Block employees were charged last month with stealing the identities of more than 60 customers and pocketing at least $290,000. In the separate federal case announced on Thursday in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the 26 tax preparers who were charged had filed thousands of fraudulent returns using the stolen identities of dead people and residents of Puerto Rico, who do not pay federal income tax. Most of the 35,000 returns prepared by the defendants since 2001, yielding more than $95 million in refunds, were fraudulent, Bharara said. One of the preparers arrested was Kelvin Crucey, a senior vice president with the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a prominent economic-development nonprofit in Harlem. Crucey claimed $250,000 in fraudulent refunds, prosecutors said. The customers of the H&R Block branch, Hawa and Johns, finally received their allotted refunds recently after considerable headache and red tape. ",1
"End of the EU? Germany Warns of Brexit Domino Effect as 5 More Countries Push to Leave EuropeBy Matt Agorist The EU and NATO are evil institutions. These two institutions are mechanisms created by Washington in order to destroy the sovereignty of European peoples. These two institutions give Washington control over the Western world and serve both as cover and enabler of Washingtons aggression. Without the EU and NATO, Washington could not force Europe and the UK into conflict with Russia, and Washington could not have destroyed seven Muslim countries in 15 years without being isolated as a hated war criminal government, no member of whom could have travelled abroad without being arrested and put on trial. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Germany fears France, Austria, Finland, the Netherlands and Hungary may follow the UK and leave the EU, the government paper says. As it stands now, since Brits will no longer be forced to pay taxes to the EU, Germanysfair sharewill be increased by 3 billion euros a year. Not wanting to shell out the extra cash, Germany is recommending that the EU enters into negotiations aimed at making the UK anassociated partner country for the remaining 27 nations rendering Brexit impotent. While some of the intentions and promoters behind Brexit certainly have ties to anti-Muslimimmigration, the idea of decentralizing power tends only to further the cause of freedom. And, freedom is contagious. After Britains declaration of independence on Friday,Frances National Front leader Marine Le Pen changed her Twitter profile picture to a Union Jack and declared victory for freedom, while the Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders said: The Dutch people deserve a referendum as well. Politicians in Hungary voiced their concerns about EU dictates as well on Friday. Brussels must hear the voice of the people, this is the biggest lesson from this decision, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told public radio. Stating the obvious, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, There is no point beating about the bush: today is a watershed for Europe, it is a watershed for the European unification process. The European Union is nothing more than unelected bureaucrats seeking to amass power and then use that power to force other countries to do their bidding. Unfortunately, it took a refugee crisis, essentially created by the West and the EU, to wake Europeans and their leaders up to this fact. Regardless of their reasons for leaving the EU, the UK has set off a potential catalyst for change that will inevitably lead to a more free world. The spreading of freedom, however, is an enemy to tyranny, and the global elite will not go quietly. When a secession happens, it is usually followed by revenge and attacks. Former secretary of the treasury and economist Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has predicted what is to come. The British people, or a majority of them, gave Washington the bird. But the fight is not over. Perhaps it hasnt really yet begun. Here is what the British can likely expect: The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and George Soros will conspire to attack the British pound, driving it down and terrorizing the British economy. We will see who is the strongest: the will of the British people or the will of the CIA, the One Percent, and the EU and neocon nazis. The coming attack on the British economy is the reason that leave supporters such as Boris Johnson are mistaken in their belief that there is no need for haste in exiting the EU. The longer it takes for the British to escape from the authoritarian EU, the longer Washington and the EU can inflict punishment on the British people for voting to leave and the more time the presstitutes will have to convince the British people that their vote was a mistake. As the vote is nonbinding, a cowardly and cowed Parliament could reject the vote. George Soros exposed the dependence of the elite on the EU when he took to fearmongering about rampant financial collapse upon Brexit and he issued threats backing up Roberts predictions. The Brexit crash will make all of you poorer be warned, Soros penned in an op-ed for the Guardian on June 20. My 60 years of experience tells me the pound will plummet, along with your living standards. The only winners will be the speculators [] A vote to leave could see the week end with a Black Friday, and serious consequences for ordinary people. On Friday, Britains biggest banks faced double-digit losses on the stock markets, with shares plunging. Barclays dropped by 23.08% to $8.60, HSBC shares dropped 7.35% to $31.25, Royal Bank of Scotland sunk a whopping 19.63% to $6.02. In the US, JPMorgan Chase shares were down 6.26% to $60.04. Bank of America shares fell 6.34% to $13.15, Citigroup shares dropped 8.3% to $40.77, and Wells Fargo dived 4.7% at $45.66. The big investment banks were also hit hard with Goldman Sachs shares down 5.26%, and Morgan Stanley shares dropping 8.57% to $24.94. The global banking industry is entirely dependent on centralization of power to keep their balance sheets in order as their model requires a controlled economy and war. However, as Brexit has already shown, this model is not in the interests of the people. As nations continue to declare their independence, the cartel will crumble. The predictions of a Brexit domino effect need to turn into actions before this momentum is lost. If the people give in to the financial terrorism and scaremongering by the banking elite and their puppet politicians, any chance for independence could be lost in fear. As Roberts points out,Cameron should step down immediately, not months from now in October. The new British government should tell the EU that the British peoples decision is implemented now, not in two years and that all political and legal relationships terminated as of the vote. Otherwise, in two years the British will be so beat down by punishments and propaganda that their vote will be overturned. The British government should immediately announce the termination of its participation in Washingtons sanctions on Russia and hook its economy to the rising nations of Russia, China, India, and Iran. With this support, the British can survive the Washington-led attack on their economy.

RUSSIA WAS MADE THE ENEMY TO MAKE THE CHICKS RUN TO THE MOTHER HEN (the U.S.). PUTIN, CHINA IRAN HAVE ENDED U.S./NATO/ISRAEL OIL WARS. SYRIAS THE LAST ONE! Britains peasants won their country back with the Breaks It Revolt. A slap in the face for the Establishment and a kick in the butt for the disgusting Leftists. ETA, first line should read the self-servers No. One could hardly call the working class who seem to be the only ones having common sense self-servers. They proved they are the real patriots. They got back their country, their sovereignty from evil EU fascists. and why not, other countries should also push for the exit, because the truth was not out there for the real people until the final exit, the government and the BBC continues with the lies right up until the end, and now we know for sure that the EU was created and controlled by the USA, but now so many sides have admitted it, also in this US control was a group of unelected parasites making decisions in our name, and I personally resent that, we were led by our government to believe in the Economics and value of our controllers, we must all start to remember without the working class [people this country would not exist, and pride must always come before the value of our coin. and now and also when the rest of the truth comes out, and the main concern for other existing EU members is why were DENMARK and IRELAND forced to vote again after already voting a big NO, I keep asking and I have still not found a valid reason yet. also I hope that we can go forward and not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by the USA into making anymore sanctions against RUSSIA or other EUROPEAN country that they have taken a disliking to. My grandfather didnt die in WWII and my great-grandfather die in WWI just so Germany and France can tell me what shaped food I can eat. How can a vote for self-determination be wrong? People who vote for subjugation do so because it profits them, they are vassals. It shows the color of treachery is still gold. read above and it wasnt a vote it was more of a survey and a non binding one. parliament has the final say and IMHO they will say yea or nay not the ppl Not even the Labour and Tory weaklings who tried to scare the people into staying are that stupid or that brave. Parliament will agree to Exit. I dont think the British Parliament likes the idea that the Queen would no longer be Head of the British Armed Forces, and she would be subject to Brussels. Exactly. It is the Leftists who want to remain. They love the nanny state! The British people took back their country and sovereignty. They sure did. The ones that were POed out numbered the whiners. The peasants were mainly conservatives. Unfortunately your grand- and great grandfathers died fighting the wrong enemy. The real enemy has always been Bolshevik Communism which deceived the American and British populations into fighting Against independence and sovereignty. The bitter fruits of that misjudgement is becoming more poisonous in each passing decade. The Bolsheviks are not going to easily accept this upstart British independence and we can expect ruthless counter measures. it was a NON-binding referendum ppl pull your heads out for a breath for fresh air. the parliament has the final say on this NOT the people. this was mainly for some of the big players to goose the markets so they could make some short bids and make even more money. The queen has the power to dissolve parliament. what does that have to do with anything in my post? pull your head out your not smelling daffodils lol You wrote it was a non-binding referendum. and that parliament has the final say on it. The queen, relishing the peoples victory, can dissolve parliament. Britains exit from the EU of Tyranny is a nightmare for the NWO. the queen can, has always had that power nothing new there. has she? so far no. will she? thats the question and only time will tell but the longer it goes with her Not dissolving parliament the less likely it will happen. but again IMHO it was all just a distraction or misdirection in order for some of the big players to take advantage of the markets and do some short selling like they did in 92 Britain is a Monarchy. Britains Constitution does not allow any politician, any Parlimentarian to abandon its Rule of Law by handing over the powers of the British government to a foreign power. dodged the issue, the queen can dissolve parliament. has she? no. will she? its still possible but the longer it goes the less likely it will happen Sovereign bipeds should take back all that which has been stolen from them. British Stocks UP. the UK was the best performing European market following the Brexit outcome. THANK YOU! Your posts on this article are invaluable. With your screen name, Im assuming youre British? Im 61 y.o., have been to UK several times and studied British history for 50 yrs. The Brits have always been about sovereignty and freedom, I am rejoicing at the referendum results! I KNEW the Brits would do the right thing and vote for sovereignty. SO GLAD to know the stock market is up there! You go, Britain, show us how its done! No. I am not british. I studied in Britain. We studied world history from primary school. Your citation of the article from Die Welt is wrongly associated with the quote directly below it Dr. Roberts isnt mentioned once in that article, nor did he write it, (that was Dirk Schmer), nor does his quote reflect the content of that article. Isnt it just a wee bit misleading to place that quote directly under the Welt citation, as though it reflected European thinking!? Is the Queen going to sign a retraction ofcthe Lisbon treaty? I bet the Germans dont agree with Angela at all. Theyve GOT to be sick of bailing all the others out. I was thinking Soros was behind the drop in the market. Ball and chain is right EU waited until after the Brexit vote to reveal publicly that there is an EU army with forced conscription coming. Also EU is working on plans to tax individual Europeans with proceeds going to the EU. This article lays out a plan for the UK to put the Brexit behind it. Joining economic forces with Both Russia and China (Brics perhaps) would go a long way to get the UK on track for its bright economic future. It would also put a huge dent in Americas imperial activities. The latter is probably the most important of the results of the Brexit vote, because it will protect all of Europe from a terrible fate if the US continues to provoke WWIII, as it is now doing! Many leftists I know were voting Remain, and many center Rights are Brexiters in my family the vote was also split along gender lines it seems women are Remainers most men are Exiters Im not sure how prevalent that is elsewhere. I see this issue pretty much the same as QV3, the establishment and nobs of London, coupled with many from the left, wanted Remain, the center left working and center right middle classes wanted out. I see the Remainers now despising the very democracy they were advocating not long ago, they need to understand the people have spoken and to get behind the outcome, and regain some trust in good old fashioned British values which is what Brexit in my opinion represents.

"Celtics center Kendrick Perkins is operating under the assumption that he is one of the team's 'Big Three' players, as evidenced by his post-game comments, a recent Sports Illustrated interview, and the fact that he shouts 'Big Three, baby!' while holding up three fingers after every basket he makes. 'Any time you put Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and myself, Kendrick Perkins, on a court together, you're going to win a bunch of gamesbut let's not forget there are two other guys on this team, and their names are Rajon Rondo and Kevin Garnett,' Perkins told reporters after his seven-point, two-rebound performance Sunday night. 'In fact, if Kevin continues to play the way he's been playing, you may just have to start calling us the 'Big Four.''

"Have we been here before? I know â€” it feels as if the internet, virtual reality, Donald Trump, Facebook, sequencing of the human genome and machines that can reason better than people constitute a change in the pace of change without precedent. But weâ€™ve actually been through an extraordinarily rapid transition like this before in history â€” a transition we can learn a lot from.Ian Goldin, director of the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University, and Chris Kutarna, also of Oxford Martin, have just published a book â€” â€œAge of Discovery: Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Our New Renaissanceâ€ â€” about lessons we can draw from the period 1450 to 1550, known as the Age of Discovery. It was when the world made a series of great leaps forward, propelled by da Vinci, Michelangelo, Copernicus and Columbus, that produced the Renaissance and reshaped science, education, manufacturing, communications, politics and geopolitics.â€œGutenbergâ€™s printing press provided the trigger,â€ Goldin told me by email, â€œby flipping knowledge production and exchange from tight scarcity to radical abundance. Before that, the Catholic Churches monopolized knowledge, with their handwritten Latin manuscripts locked up in monasteries. The Gutenberg press democratized information, and provided the incentive to be literate. Within 50 years, not only had scribes lost their jobs, but the Catholic Churchâ€™s millennia-old monopoly of power had been torn apart as the printing of Martin Lutherâ€™s sermons ignited a century of religious wars.â€Meanwhile, Goldin added, Copernicus upended the prevailing God-given notions of heaven and earth â€œby finding that far from the sun revolving around the earth, the earth rotated around the sun,â€ and â€œvoyages of discovery by Columbus, da Gama and Magellan tore up millennia-old maps of the â€˜knownâ€™ world.â€Those were the mother of all disruptions and led to the parallels with today.â€œNow, like then, new media have democratized information exchange, amplifying the voices of those who feel they have been injured in the upheaval,â€ said Goldin. â€œNow, like then, public leaders and public institutions have failed to keep up with rapid change, and popular trust has been deeply eroded.â€ Now, like then, â€œthis is the best moment in history to be aliveâ€ â€” human health, literacy, aggregate wealth and education are flourishing â€” and â€œthere are more scientists alive today than in all previous generations.â€And, yet many people feel worse off.Because, as in the Renaissance, key anchors in peopleâ€™s lives â€” like the workplace and community â€” are being fundamentally dislocated. The pace of technological change is outstripping the average personâ€™s ability to adapt. Now, like then, said Goldin, â€œsizable parts of the population found their skills were no longer needed, or they lived in places left behind, so inequality grew.â€ At the same time, â€œnew planetary scale systems of commerce and information exchange led to immense improvements in choices and accelerating innovations which made some people fabulously rich.â€Was there a Donald Trump back then?â€œMichelangelo and Machiavelliâ€™s Florence suffered a shocking popular power-taking when Girolamo Savonarola, a midlevel friar from Ferrara, who lived from 1452 to 1498, exploded from obscurity in the 1490s to enthrall Florentines, who felt left behind economically or culturally, with sermons that laid blame upon the misguided policies and moral corruption of their leaders,â€ said Goldin. â€œHe and his zealous supporters, though a small minority, swept away the Medici establishment and seized control of the cityâ€™s councils.â€œFrom there, Savonarola launched an ugly campaign of public purification, introducing radical laws including against homosexuality, and attacked public intellectuals in an act of intimidation that history still remembers as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Savonarola was amongst the first to tap into the information revolution of the time, and while others produced long sermons and treatises, Savonarola disseminated short pamphlets, in what may be thought of as the equivalent of political tweets.â€The establishment politicians of the day, who were low energy, â€œunderestimated the power of that new information revolution to move beyond scientific and cultural ideasâ€ to amplify populist voices challenging authority.Yikes! How do we blunt that?â€œMore risk-taking is required when things change more rapidly, both for workers who have to change jobs and for businesses who have to constantly innovate to stay ahead,â€ Goldin argued. Governmentâ€™s job is to strengthen the safety nets and infrastructure so individuals and companies can be as daring â€” in terms of learning, adapting and investing in themselves â€” as they need to be. At the same time, when the world gets this tightly woven, America â€œneeds to be more, not less, engaged, with the rest of the world,â€ because â€œthe threats posed by climate change, pandemics, cyberattacks or terror will not be reduced by America withdrawing.â€Then, as now, walls stopped working. â€œCannons and gunpowder came to Europe that could penetrate or go over walls and books could bring ideas around them,â€ he said. Then, like now, walls only made you poorer, dumber and more insecure.",1
"Dolly Parton Takes Heroic Action To Save Tennessee Wildfire Victims The wildfire in Tennessee has spread through Gatlinburg and the Great Smoky Mountains National park. More than 14,000 people have had to evacuate their homes, and 11 people have lost their lives. There has been shockingly little coverage of the fire through mainstream sources, but one star in the public light is steeping up in a major way. Dolly Partons foundation will reportedly be donating $1,000 a month to all of the families who lost their homes in the fire. They will receive this month each month for six months, or until the victims can get back on their feet. As you may know by now, there have been terrible wildfires in the Great Smoky Mountainsthe same mountains where I grew up and where my people call home, Parton said in a statement on her website. I have always believed that charity begins at home, she continued. Thats why Ive asked my Dollywood Companiesincluding the Dollywood Theme Park and DreamMore Resort; my dinner theater attractions including Dixie Stampede and Lumberjack Adventure; and my Dollywood Foundation to help me establish the My People Fund. Do you applaud Dollys efforts? ",0

"Taking steps to combat the nation's hunger problem, the federal government introduced six hearty new 'Sizzlin' Skillet' breakfasts Monday. U.S. Rep. Robert Forsythe (D-NE) unveils one of the new federally cooked skillets. 'Good news, America,' U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said. 'We've got something for even the biggest appetite. Wake up and smell what's cookin' at the federal government.' 'Go Western with the government's Hearty Ranch Skillet, featuring a zesty Denver omelette, golden hash browns, and two choices of breakfast meats,' Glickman continued. 'Or enjoy our Southern Skillet with chicken-fried steak in country gravy, flaky buttermilk biscuits, and your choice of hash browns or grits.' Each breakfast, Glickman said, is cooked to order and comes in its own miniature serving skillet. Available for a limited-time-only introductory price of $2.99, the skillets are being served at more than 2,400 participating federal locations nationwide. In cooperation with the Social Security Administration, a 15 percent discount will be available to senior citizens, veterans, and the blind. At a White House press conference, President Clinton called the skillet promotion 'the fulfillment of promises made in 1992.' 'When I first ran for president, I envisioned a future filled with hot, fresh food served fast and with a smile,' Clinton said. 'In 1980, Reagan said it was morning in America. Well, he hadn't seen anything yet. Come and get it, America.' Speaking to reporters at a campaign stop in Plant City, FL, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush sharply criticized the breakfast deal, particularly its failure to include beverages in its price. President Clinton makes sure that a Greensboro, NC, couple is enjoying their skillets. 'This is just another Democratic ploy to gouge America with hidden costs,' Bush said. 'At a George W. Bush breakfast table, coffee would be included with every breakfast, or citizens would be allowed to substitute a 12-ounce Minute Maid orange juice for 65 cents extra.' Bush also attacked the offer's long-term health effects. 'The money Americans save on a low-cost Meat Lover's Skillet will inevitably be wiped out by doctor bills when their hearts get clogged with cholesterol and empty calories. And this is to say nothing of the Great Lakes Skillet, with its corned-beef hash and three cheeses, adding up to a whopping 73 grams of fat.' Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore was quick to respond to Bush's criticisms. 'The Clinton Administration has always been mindful of changing tastes and health concerns,' said the vice-president during a speech before AFL-CIO members in Dallas. 'That's why we offer low-fat alternatives like the new spinach and mushroom Veggie Skillet, a skillet Gov. Bush consistently chooses to ignore.' Overall response to the skillet promotion has been positive. Said Saginaw, MI, resident Alan Brodhagen, sampling the Eggs Benedict New York Skillet: 'Ever since I was laid off from the auto plant eight months ago, I've been eating cold cereal for breakfastif I was even awake before noon, that is. Now, I have six tasty reasons to get up in the morning.' ",0
"Be a Proud Conspiracy Theorist, Youre in the MajorityIs everything a conspiracy? No, just the important stuff. Jeff Wells, Rigorous Intuition. It seems that the establishment media has intensified their attack on conspiracy theorists. Its long been their feeble attempt to discredit anyone who dares question the official narrative of events. But why the sudden deluge of attacks? First, what does conspiracy theory even mean? conspiracy An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. theory A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. conspiracy theory The belief that the government or a covert organization is responsible for an event that is unusual or unexplained. In short, a conspiracy theorist seeks the full facts about covert subversive acts, and unusual or unexplained events. Put another way, when the story of an event doesnt add up, theories arise to explain what really happened. Given the abominable track record of the establishment media, its become more common to question everything we hear rather than blindly swallowing their script. As the initial reporting of the Sandy Hook school massacre was so scattered, and policymakers immediately seized the crisis to promote a long desired agenda of strict gun control, its no wonder that some have questioned the authenticity of the official version of events. What is the official version, anyway? Its changed a thousand times. They want us to believe a lone-wolf psycho used an assault rifle to kill 26 innocent children and teachers. Never mind that it has come out that a rifle never entered the school and what they found in the trunk of Lanzas car was actually a shotgun. Never mind how he got through the new $300,000 surveillance/security system while wearing a mask and armed to the teeth. Never mind the reports of multiple shooters and camouflage-clad strangers arrested in the woods. Dont worry about the Emergency Response Team (ERT) that was simulating this exact same school shooter scenario on the same day in a nearby town. And, dont ask why theres a strange lack of injured survivors, credible witnesses, or anyone who even knew Adam Lanza. And, finally, how would gun control have prevented this event? I must be an evil, heartless conspiracy theorist who pisses on the graves of those killed that day because Id like answers to these questions. At least thats what the establishment media wants you to believe about me and others who desire better explanations than what weve been given. Media figures, particularly CIA intern Anderson Cooper of CNN, is using his bully pulpit to demonize anyone who questions the Sandy Hook event and lump them all into the most radical theory that says no one was murdered that day. The fact that he dedicated nearly an entire show to disputing a conspiracy theory, in and of itself is telling. Meanwhile, AC was caught pulling a 360 on viewers by showing active-shooter drill footage from another school as if it was the breaking news feed of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. But, as Cooper struggles to attract 200K viewers per night to his pulpit, an amateur video questioning the anomalies of Sandy Hook received an astonishing 10 million views in one week. Therein lies the primary reason the establishment can no longer ignore conspiracy theorists, because theyre now the majority. According to a recentFairleigh Dickinson University polla majority of Americans (63%) believe at least one political conspiracy theory. Dan Cassino, a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University who helped conduct the poll said People tend to believe that where theres smoke, theres fire so the more smoke they see, the more likely they are to believe that something is going on. Regarding 9/11, Cassino says; Its easy to discount conspiracy theories about 9/11, but this isnt some fringe belief. Trutherism is alive and well in America, and is only going to get stronger as memories of the actual event fade. Another likely motivation for the recent attacks on conspiracy theorists is because a staggering majority no longer trusts the corporate media or the government. Recent polling showed record level (60%) ofdistrust for the media,and Congress is less popular than cockroaches with a dismal9% favorable rating. Its clear that the dying corporate media wants their viewers to despise anyone who questions the official narrative of any event that is unusual or unexplained in a desperate attempt to keep viewers locked to their trusted news channel. I, for one, am proud to question everything I hear in the so-called news. And the bigger they hype a story, the more I question it. As professor Cassino said, where theres smoke, theres fire. Usually someone, or a group of someones, clearly benefits from a certain subversive act. As such, they seem to have much more of a motivation than some lone wolf who kills himself after committing unexplainable atrocities or some cave dweller claiming to hate our freedom. Is this always the case? Of course not. But the more hype the establishment puts behind a questionable event, the more reason there is to find out cui bono who benefits? Below is a great video dissertation by James Corbett about conspiracies and the media response to them: ",0
"Valerie Hunter Gordon, who has died aged 94, designed the worldâ€™s first disposable nappy, initially in 1947 using nylon from old wartime parachutes. Awaiting the birth of her third child, she dreaded what she called the â€œawful labourâ€ of washing, drying and ironing cloth nappies. Surprised there was no alternative, she determined to invent one. The result was a two-part system, the Paddi: an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable, biodegradable pad, made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool. She received a patent for the invention in October 1949. The first 400 she made at her kitchen table with a Singer sewing machine, selling them to friends for five shillings apiece. Boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in 1950, after a Lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes. Seventy-two thousand of them sold in 1950, then, in 1951, 250,000. By 1960, the number was 6m. The American company Procter & Gamble began producing the all-in-one Pampers from 1961, which, though not biodegradable, were cheaper. The Paddi entered a slow decline in sales, the last rolling of the assembly line in 1990. Hunter Gordonâ€™s subsequent inventions included the Nikini, one of the first modern sanitary towels, in 1954, and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour. Rather than ironing, she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet. Tiring of polishing her familyâ€™s mahogany table, she made a plastic top, saying â€œif anybody important comes to stay, weâ€™ll take it offâ€. It never came off, including during a visit to her house by Margaret Thatcher. Hunter Gordonâ€™s drawing room became a laboratory of invention, with her children Nigel and Frances often roped in to serve as models.    Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordonâ€™s nappies in all their branches in 1950   Daughter of Sir Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Wilson), she was born in the Peak District, in the small Derbyshire village of Baslow, into a family of inventors. Her grandfather, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, was an Italian-Liverpudlian electrical engineer. Being one of the few experts on alternating-current electricity in Britain, in 1891 he designed the worldâ€™s first modern power station, at Deptford, south-east London. Valerieâ€™s father oversaw the expansion of the family business, Ferranti, into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions, involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing. Valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfatherâ€™s house, living nearby until his death in 1930. He worked often at home, and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked, and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives. â€œI suspect that is where she learned if you have a need, and itâ€™s not fulfilled, then maybe you could do something about it yourself,â€ said her son Nigel. â€œI know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing, and she loved to listen to it.â€ She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school, in Roehampton, south-west London, run by a French teaching order of nuns. (After the second world war, the school relocated to the Surrey village of Woldingham, and presently exists as Woldingham school.) In 1940, she married a Scottish major and electrical engineer, Patrick Hunter Gordon. Both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from Dunkirk â€“ her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes, by way of the Spanish border, arriving home just in time for their wedding. When Patrick left the army in 1950, the family moved to Beauly, 10 miles west of Inverness. He took over a family business, AI Welders and Cable Belts. He suffered from post-traumatic illness, in which she was a constant support; he, in turn, requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments, helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues, and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially. Her father also was an unflagging supporter. Hunter Gordon wrote to the nappy-makers Robinsons of Chesterfield, who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the 1930s. At a Royal Society dinner, her father then found himself seated beside the companyâ€™s chairman, Sir Robert Robinson â€“ which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to Chesterfield. She convinced the company to produce them in bulk, paying her royalties, starting in late 1949. Those familiar with Hunter Gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful, with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject. Supremely confident in her own judgment, she was nonetheless personally modest and self-effacing. She said later if she had known the amount of work involved in seeing her invention through, she â€œwould have gone on washing the damned thingsâ€. Patrick died in a car accident in 1978. She is survived by their six children, Hugh, Alison, Nigel â€“ the inspiration and model for the original disposable nappy â€“ Frances, Richard and Kit, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. â€¢ Valerie Hunter Gordon, inventor, born 7 December 1921; died 16 October 2016",1
"New Obama Executive Order Pushes Us Closer to a North American Union and a One World Economic SystemMichael Snyder, Contributor At every turn, Obama has endeavored to more fully integrate America into the global community. Since he was elected, Obama has signed a whole host of new international economic agreements. He regularly speaks of the need for cooperation among global religions and he has hosted a wide variety of different religious celebrations at the White House. Obama once stated that all nations must come together to build a stronger global regime. If you do not want to live in a global regime that is just too bad. To globalists such as Obama, it is inevitable that the United States of America will be merged into the emerging global system. Just this week, Obama has issued a new executive order that seeks to harmonize U.S. economic regulations with the rest of the world. This new executive order is yet another incremental step that is pushing us closer to a North American Union and a one world economic system. Unfortunately, most Americans have absolutely no idea what is happening. Obamas order provides a framework to organize scattered efforts to promote international regulatory cooperation, the chambers top global regulatory official said today. Todays executive order marks a paradigm shift for U.S. regulators by directing them to take the international implications of their work into account in a consistent and comprehensive way, Sean Heather, vice president of the chambers Center for Global Regulatory Cooperation, said in an e-mailed statement. Members of the Obama administration are touting this as a way to reduce regulation, but the truth is that this is much more about aligning ourselves with the rest of the world than anything else. Obamas Information Czar, Cass Sunstein, authored a piece in the Wall Street Journal on Monday in which he stressed the need to eliminate unnecessary regulatory differences across nations so that the United States can compete more effectively in our interdependent global economy. The end result of this process will be that we will now do things much more like how the rest of the world does things. In an interdependent global economy, diverse regulations can cause trouble for companies doing business across national boundaries. Unnecessary differences in countries regulatory requirements can cost money, compromising economic growth and job creation. Think of divergent requirements for car headlights, or the labeling of food, or standards for container sizes. Recognizing this, President Obamas Jobs Council has called for U.S. agencies to better align U.S. regulations with those of our major trading partners. And today the president is issuing an executive order, Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation, with a simple goal: to promote exports, growth, and job creation by eliminating unnecessary regulatory differences across nations. But a one world economic system is not going to arrive overnight. Initially, it is much more likely that there will be a very strong push toward North American integration first. The goal will be to shape North America into an integrated regional economic unit similar to the EU. Cass Sunstein discussed how this new executive order will affect North American integration on the White House website on Tuesday. The new Executive Order will build on work that is already underway. We have started close to home, with President Obama launching Regulatory Cooperation Councils with Prime Minister Harper of Canada and President Calderon of Mexico. The Councils are implementing work plans to eliminate or prevent the creation of unnecessary regulatory differences that adversely affect cross-border trade; to streamline regulatory requirements; and to promote greater certainty for the general public and businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, in the regulation of food, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, and other areas. The United States and Canada released the United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Joint Action Plan last December. In February, we announced the United States-Mexico High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC) Work Plan. Most Americans have absolutely no idea how far plans to integrate the United States, Canada and Mexico have advanced. Last year, Barack Obama signed an agreement to create a North American security perimeter and most Americans never even heard about it because the mainstream news networks almost entirely ignored it. But this is exactly what the globalists want. They dont want people to become alarmed by these moves toward North American integration. In fact, a document uncovered by Wikileaks shows that those involved in the effort to integrate North America believe that an incremental approach is best. Apparently they believe that small moves toward integration are less likely to alarm the general population. The following is from an article that appeared in The National Post last year. The integration of North Americas economies would best be achieved through an incremental approach, according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable. The cable, released through the WikiLeaks website and apparently written Jan. 28, 2005, discusses some of the obstacles surrounding the merger of the economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico in a fashion similar to the European Union. An incremental and pragmatic package of tasks for a new North American Initiative (NAI) will likely gain the most support among Canadian policymakers, the document said. The economic payoff of the prospective North American initiative is available, but its size and timing are unpredictable, so it should not be oversold. If the people of Canada, the United States and Mexico were told that there was a plan to merge all three economies, there might be massive protests to stop it, and the globalists do not want that. A few years ago, the Security and Prosperity Partnership Of North America (SPP) that was being promoted by President George W. Bush started to generate quite a bit of negative publicity. That caused those seeking to integrate the economies of North America to back off for a little while. But as an article by Jerome Corsi last year detailed, the eventual goal is to turn North America into another version of the eurozone. That includes a common currency for North America called the amero. The SPP in the administration of President George W. Bush appeared designed to replicate the steps taken in Europe over a 50-year period following the end of World War II to transform an economic agreement under the European Common Market into a full-fledged regional government, operating as the European Union, with its own currency, the euro, functioning as the sole legitimate currency in what has become known as the eurozone. The concern under the SPP has been that the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, could be evolved into a regional government, the North American Union, with a regional currency, the amero, designed to replace the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. So will we ever see the amero replace the U.S. dollar? Hopefully not. If the globalists try to introduce the amero, it would probably be after a horrible financial crisis in which the U.S. dollar falls apart. The amero would be heralded as the solution to the problems that were plaguing the dollar. If there ever is a move to get rid of the U.S. dollar for an international currency of some kind, the American people will need to resist it with all of their might. The more integrated the world becomes, the more likely it becomes that we will see nightmarish global tyranny someday. It is very frightening to think of what someone very evil might do if they had the chance to run the entire planet. Once our national sovereignty is gone, it will be incredibly difficult to get back. If the American people dont take a stand while they still can, their children may wake up someday as citizens of a very oppressive global regime.

"It used to be that clafoutis were always baked French pancakes studded with cherries.Some clafoutis were smooth and flanlike; others puffed and turned golden brown on top. Some versions called for pitted cherries for greater ease of eating. Others insisted on whole cherries so the pits could add almondy nuance. And when cherries werenâ€™t in season, different fruits stepped in: apricots, plums, berries, even pears.But sweetness was a necessity, part of the deal. Until one day it wasnâ€™t.Clafoutis have moved on to the savory side. Now, in addition to classic recipes served for dessert or brunch, youâ€™ll see them studded with meat, vegetables and cheese fors lunch and dinner. For anyone who loves puffy, eggy savories like the soft interior of a quiche, a cheesy frittata or a custardy Yorkshire pudding, this is a very good trend indeed.Making the switch from sweet to savory is simple to do, as long as you donâ€™t mess with the structure of the pancake. The ratio of eggs to milk to flour needs to remain largely in place.But beyond that, anything goes. Adding herbs, spices and grated cheese will give you a nicely piquant base in which to stir more substantial fillings: meat, vegetables, bits of leftover curry stashed in the fridge. Just make sure that whatever meats and vegetables you use are cooked through before you fold them in. They wonâ€™t cook any more while the pancake is in the oven; they just heat through while the egg batter around them sets and inflates.This vegetable-rich version is an excellent vehicle for using up the last of the summer corn, to which I add Swiss chard and leeks for color and heft, along with garlic, herbs, cheese and both red and black pepper for bite.It bakes up browned and almost soufflÃ©d on top, with a dense, rich middle. But it will deflate quickly. So for maximum drama, have your guests seated at the table when you pull it out of the oven. This said, itâ€™s perfectly delicious after it flattens out. It may not be as striking, but with its salty depth of flavor, itâ€™s just as irresistible.Recipes: Savory Clafoutis | Berry Clafoutis",1
"You just took my parking space!â€ If you donâ€™t believe in fate you probably believe in chance. Sometimes itâ€™s good, sometimes not, as any Monopoly player will testify. So it plays out as Iâ€™m walking away from the car when the voice repeats, â€œOi â€“ you took my fucking parking space!â€ I realise that the bloke in his early 20s, girlfriend in tow, is addressing me and IÂ go full-on middle England peacemaker, â€œSorry. I didnâ€™t see you, but youâ€™ve got a space, OK?â€ looking towards his car. With hindsight, I was a bit thick. MyÂ 20-year-old Audi had recently beenÂ sold and replaced with a newer, sporty soft top, which, although 12 years old and a lot less costly than shouty boyâ€™s hatchback, shines like a beacon for the envious. Iâ€™d noticed people were less accommodating in traffic than when Iâ€™m in my Volvo, but nothing prepared me for what happensÂ next. I walk past him towards my appointment with a tin of Eating Room Red paint in the DIY store but as I do so he grabs my shoulder, spinning me violently using his superior weight and height. Iâ€™ve never really been in an adult fight despite years of karate with the kids. I remember the martial arts teacher making clear early on that karate is largely about not fighting. Itâ€™s more the art of running away with menaces â€“ reacting only to aggression and seeking as few blows/actions as possible to disable your opponent so you can run away. You seek to avoid a fight because you know it is likely to end in hospital or court. This reflects the fact that, despite being a fun family activity for a Saturday morning, karate is an all-in and very vicious martial art. Other than a minor scuffle with a drunk at work, Iâ€™ve never been close to using it, but do so now, in the car park, with surprising calmness.   I carry his momentum through to hit him in the side of the neck rather harder than I may have intended   Using the momentum heâ€™s created in spinning me and deflecting the fist coming towards my glasses, I carry his momentum through to hit him in the side of the neck rather harder than I may have intended, which was veryÂ hard. Down he goes, silently and, to me, rather surprisingly. Then the really frightening bit happens. My calmness vanishes. Seeing him lying there, Iâ€™m overcome by possibly the greatest rage Iâ€™ve ever felt. I want to follow him down to the ground with fists and feet and really hurt him. Luckily for him, but even more so for me, and for the kids, his girlfriend starts screaming, â€œYouâ€™ve killed him, heâ€™s fucking dead,â€ over his still-inert form. Itâ€™s like sheâ€™s thrown an ice bucket over me and, far from running away, I stick around to check heâ€™s OK. Itâ€™s a dicey decision, as it could all have kicked off, but the situation is defused by his girlfriend, who proves yet again that nothing is predictable inÂ relationships. She starts shouting again but this time at her now groaningÂ beau. â€œYou arsehole, you picked that fight and got what you deserve. You were already parked. Wanker!â€ He is clearly OK physically, but under a siege of a different sort, so I say goodbye and leave. Afterwards, Iâ€™m a bit shaky about the whole thing. Not only does it show how things can turn in a second â€“ he could have knifed me â€“ but also that the level of anger I felt was crazy. What might have happened had this manâ€™s girlfriend not brought me to my senses bodes badly â€“ the last thing the kids need is me in prison for ABH orÂ worse. How much more extreme would my reaction have been had Millie and Matt been under threat? Iâ€™m hopeful it wonâ€™t happen again and feel Iâ€™ve crossed another milestone of understanding â€“ my seething anger was all about the injustice of such a first-class tosser even being alive when Helen isnâ€™t. I may have needed it to happen some time, and it is, hopefully, done. It emphasises that I really need the counselling Iâ€™ve signed up to. Iâ€™ve been very lucky that this time my Chance card read, â€œGet out of jail freeâ€. Adam Golightly is a pseudonym @MrAdamGolightly",1
"Does Conventional Medical Training Destroy Empathy?Sayer Ji In one study published in 2009 in the journal Academic Medicine entitled, The devil is in the third year: a longitudinal study of erosion of empathy in medical school, the authors conclude: It is ironic that the erosion of empathy occurs during a time when the curriculum is shifting toward patient-care activities; this is when empathy is most essential. Other studies reach similar conclusions. In another, higher-powered systematic review published in the same journal last year entitled Empathy decline and its reasons: a systematic review of studies with medical students and residents, researchers looked at data from 1990-2010, which included 18 studies, and found: The five longitudinal and two cross-sectional studies of residents showed a decrease in empathy during residency. The studies pointed to the clinical practice phase of training and the distress produced by aspects of the hidden, formal, and informal curricula as main reasons for empathy decline. They concluded: The results of the reviewed studies, especially those with longitudinal data, suggest that empathy decline during medical school and residency compromises striving toward professionalism and may threaten health care quality. In a 2005 study published in Academic Medicine and entitled Mood change and empathy decline persist during three years of internal medicine training, researchers noted that some of the mood disturbances and declines in empathy associated with residency/internship never fully recover, indicating that conventional medical training may produce real, diagnosable psychological traumas that may never be fully resolved and may adversely affect the quality of healthcare provided. Empathy, after all, has concrete and measurable therapeutic effects in others. In 2009, researchers found that practitioner empathy reduced the duration of the common cold in their patients. Conversely, a negative and/or indifferent attitude towards the patient has measurable adverse effects, also known as the nocebo effect. Indeed, our recent article titled, Research: Some Cancer Diagnoses Kill You Quicker Than the Cancer, discusses the finding that the risk of suicide is up to 16 times higher and the risk of heart-related death 26.9 times higher during the first week following a cancer diagnosis versus those who were diagnosed cancer free.

"More Questions About The International Criminal CourtBy Dr. David Hoile While the ICC presents itself as the worlds court this is simply not the case. Its members represent just over one quarter of the worlds population: China, Russia, the United States, India, Pakistan and Indonesia are just some of the many countries that have remained outside of the Courts jurisdiction. A court is also only as credible as its independence. Far from being an independent and impartial court, the ICCs own statute grants special prosecutorial rights of referral and deferral to the Security Council by default its five permanent members (three of which are not even ICC members). Political interference in the legal process was thus made part of the Courts founding terms of reference. The Court is also inextricably tied to the European Union which provides over 60 percent of its funding. The expression He who pays the piper calls the tune could not be more appropriate. The fact that the big five ICC funders are Africas former colonial masters also sits uneasily with a continent suspicious of recolonisation by questionable legal diktat. The EU is additionally guilty of blatant political and economic blackmail in tying aid for developing countries to ICC membership. Africa is also correct when it points out that the ICC is self-evidently a racist court, in that it treats one race of people differently to all others. Instead of impartially enforcing the Rome Statute, the Europeans have chosen to focus the Court exclusively on Africa. African heads of state have spoken of race hunting. Despite having received almost 9,000 formal complaints about alleged war crimes in at least 139 countries, the ICC has chosen to indict 36 black Africans in eight African countries. In so doing the ICC has ignored all European or Western human rights abuses in conflicts such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq or human rights abuses by Western client states. While the ICCs key first two cases were African self-referrals it is now clear that the African governments were made an offer they could not refuse: refer yourself and we will only indict your rebels if not we will indict both government and rebels. The ICC has emerged very much as a European-funded and directed instrument of European foreign policy. Broader western hypocrisy is all too evident. The United States has forcefully pointed out that the ICC is a kangaroo court, a travesty of justice open to political influence and that no American citizen will ever come before it. Washington is nonetheless very happy, for its own political reasons, to demand that black Africans appear before it. Double standards and politics aside, the ICC has shown itself to be irretrievably dysfunctional. The courts proceedings thus far have often been questionable where not simply farcical. Its judges some of whom have never been lawyers, let alone judges are the result of grubbily corrupt vote-trading amongst member states. Far from securing the best legal minds in the world this produces mediocrity. At least one elected judge had neither law degree nor legal experience but her country had contributed handsomely to the ICC budget. The Court has produced witnesses who recanted their testimony the moment they got into the witness box, admitting that they were coached by non-governmental organisations as to what false statements to make. Dozens of other witnesses have similarly disavowed their evidence. Most recently the ICC prosecutor had to admit that one of its own star witnesses in its case against Kenyan Vice-President Ruto was a thoroughly unreliable and incredible witness. And then there has also been the ICC prosecutor who was not only seemingly unaware of the legal concept of presumption of innocence but also threatened to criminalise third-parties who might argue a presumption of innocence on the part of those indicted and as yet unconvicted by the Court. A clearer case of Alice in Wonderland justice, along the lines of sentence first, verdict afterwards, is difficult to find. There has been prosecutorial misconduct, not least of which hiding exculpatory evidence, which should have ended any fair trial because they would have compromised the integrity of any legal process. The ICCs first trial proceeded erratically because of crass prosecutorial misbehavior and judicial decisions to add new charges half-way through proceedings, a move that was subsequently overturned. Simply put, the Court and the prosecutor have been making things up as they go along. The ICC claims to be economical and to bring swift justice, yet it has consumed more than a billion Euros in its 13 year existence and has only secured two questionable convictions. The ICC claims to be victim-centred yet Human Rights Watch has publicly criticised the ICCs ambivalence towards victim communities. The ICC claims to be fighting impunity, yet it has granted de jure immunity to the United States and afforded de facto immunity and impunity to NATO member states and several serial abusers of human rights who happen to be friends of the European Union and United States. Far from bringing peace to Africa, the ICCs double-standards and autistic legal blundering has derailed delicate peace processes across the continent thereby prolonging devastating civil wars. The court is responsible for the death, injury and displacement of many thousands of Africans. The ICCs involvement in Uganda, for example, destroyed peace talks in that country, intensifying the conflict which then spread into three neighbouring countries. The reality is that the ICC is an inept political court that does not have Africas welfare at heart, only the furtherance of Western foreign policy and its own bureaucratic imperative to exist, to employ more Europeans and North Americans and where possible to continue to increase its budget all at the expense of African lives. There are far more questions than answers about this Court.

The ICC was quick to indict Milosovic of War Crimes while the real criminals of the Yugoslavian Wars, the German BND and the U.S. CIA were let off the hook. This is indeed a kangroo court which does not impartially examine the evidence available.

"In a 45-minute video posted on Tibetan websites Thursday, Tsuglag Rinpoche, leader of the Buddhist extremist group Kammahna, threatened to soon inflict a wave of peace and tranquility on the West. Speaking in front of a nondescript altar surrounded by candles, burning sticks of incense, and a small golden statue of the Buddha, Rinpoche did not specify when or where an assault of profound inner stillness would occur, but stated in no uncertain terms that the fundamentalist Buddhist cell plans to target all Western suffering. In the name of the Great Teacher, we will stop at nothing to unleash a firestorm of empathy, compassion, and true selflessness upon the West, said Rinpoche, adding that all enemies of a freely flowing, unfettered state of mind will be besieged with pure, everlasting happiness. No city will be spared from spiritual harmony. We will bring about the end to all Western pain and anxiety, to all destructive cravings, to all greed, delusion, and misplaced desire. Indeed, we will bring the entire United States to its knees in deep meditation. Wisdom and virtue to America! continued Rinpoche. Wisdom and virtue to all living things on earth! According to reports, Rinpoche stressed throughout his address that Kammahna soldiers would continue waging a tireless holy war on Western feelings of emptiness and negativity for as long as necessary, noting that a jug fills drop by drop and that it is better to travel well than to arrive. The extremist leader specifically criticized the United States for its blatant disregard of karmic balance within the universe and ominously claimed that Americans will one day soon experience the highest form of metaphysical equilibrium through a union of both body and mind. Rinpoche also said all Western nations would pay a heavy price in negative thinking and self-doubt if they do not immediately engage in serious introspection and true spiritual liberation. Sources confirmed the video then featured an uninterrupted 19-minute clip of water quietly flowing between rocks in a small forest creek. Kammahna's video ABOVE: Watch a short clip from the Kammahna's 45-minute video. From New York City to London, Madrid, and Paris, we will not cease until every major metropolis is left in a state of total nirvana, said Rinpoche, brandishing a pink lotus flower before claiming that Kammahna will seize any opportunity to aggressively instill a deep-seated sense of oneness in all Westerners. We offered the unenlightened governments of America and Europe a chance to embrace the Eightfold Path, but you have refused. Now, we have no choice but to impose a peaceful spiritual reawakening upon you. And if you think even for a moment that we will ever relent, remember this: Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened, Rinpoche added. You have been warned. Kammahna, a radical Mahyna Buddhism movement, was founded in Nepal in the late 1970s with the explicit mission to spread a fundamentalist interpretation of the Four Noble Truths to all nonbelievers. According to experts, the multinational organization operates somewhere in a remote region of the Himalayas, though the current whereabouts of Rinpoche and Kammahnas other high-ranking members are reportedly unknown. Kammahna first came to international prominence in 1997, when five of its members boarded a New York City subway car and held 42 hostages in a state of transcendent serenity for seven hours while performing atonal syllabic chants. The group then claimed responsibility for a severe 2004 outbreak of interconnectedness in central London, later traced to a 23-year-old Kammahna sleeper cell operative who sat cross-legged in Trafalgar Square and read aloud from The Gateless Gate collection of 13th-century Zen koans. Kammahna claims to gain thousands of newly reincarnated followers each day and is reportedly known to recruit many young Buddhists from around the world, training them in tranquil insurgency tactics at covert monasteries across Eastern Asia. I want to assure all Americans that we are fully aware of these threats from Kammahna, and they will not be taken lightly, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Rand Beers said at a press conference shortly after Rinpoches video surfaced, adding that several U.S. cities have been placed on high alert and authorities are watching closely for any suspicious peaceful activity in densely populated areas. We do believe that Kammahna currently possesses the means to inflict widespread balance in the collective subconscious of an American city. However, we are doing absolutely everything in our power to prevent that from happening. The danger of total enlightenment is very real, Beers added. And we must be prepared. At press time, sources confirmed that President Obama has authorized a preemptive strike on Kammahna and deployed a fleet of predator drones to bomb Tibet. ",0
"â€œIâ€™m a pretty good detective,â€ Jane Klain said, but she is no badge-wielding, revolver-packing gumshoe. She is in charge of research services for a museum.The latest product of her sleuthing was playing on a computer on the desk behind her â€” a 104-minute performance of â€œThe Glass Menagerieâ€ starring Shirley Booth, Hal Holbrook and Barbara Loden that was broadcast 50 years ago. As far as anyone knew, the master videotape was lost.Ms. Klain, who works for the Paley Center for Media, formerly the Museum of Broadcasting and the Museum of Television and Radio, is always on the lookout for lost programs that are sought by scholars and biographers. Late last year, she noticed a one-line listing that led to four forgotten reels of videotape at the University of Southern California â€” the raw footage from which the original master tape of â€œThe Glass Menagerieâ€ was assembled.She turned to video restoration specialists, who created what amounted to a new master tape. It will be shown on Thursday on Turner Classic Movies, 50 years to the day after the original telecast.â€œShe is one of the heroes of archiving and finding these lost treasures,â€ said Dan Wingate, who does video reconstructions and put together the new final version of â€œThe Glass Menagerie.â€ â€œIt takes someone with real dedication and diligence and being willing to be said â€˜noâ€™ to over and over and keep going, and thatâ€™s what she has.â€Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming and production for TCM and the film-streaming site FilmStruck, described her as â€œknowledgeable, passionate and eager to talk about anything thatâ€™s exciting that she has stumbled across or discovered.â€In 22 years with the museum, she has discovered dozens of video treasures, not all from the very earliest days of television. She mentions tracking down a broadcast of the musical â€œJunior Missâ€ that starred Don Ameche, Carol Lynley and Jill St. John in 1957, and a kinescope of a rehearsal of Rodgers and Hammersteinâ€™s â€œCinderella,â€ also from 1957.She kept after archivists at the University of Wisconsin until they checked an all-but-forgotten closet and found what she was looking for, a videotape of Edward Albeeâ€™s play â€œThe American Dream,â€ recorded in 1963, but never broadcast. She had seen it on a listing of the places in which the producer David Susskindâ€™s programs were housed.â€œThe Glass Menagerie,â€ also produced by Mr. Susskind, had long been on her wish list, in part because the play is perennially popular and the 1966 telecast stuck in viewersâ€™ minds. â€œEvery time a production of â€˜The Glass Menagerieâ€™ bubbles up, people contact me: â€˜What about the Shirley Booth one?â€™â€ she said. â€œThe answer has always been, â€˜No, it doesnâ€™t exist.â€™â€The disappearance of the tape was puzzling. The program was praised by Jack Gould, then the television critic for The New York Times. He called it â€œan evening of superb theaterâ€ and described Miss Booth as â€œflutteryâ€ and â€œappropriately intrusive as the perennial Mrs. Fix-it,â€ although he noted that at times, â€œher belle seemed a shade mechanized and not intuitively Southern.â€Ms. Klain located the raw footage from another list of Mr. Susskindâ€™s programs. â€œI looked through it casually,â€ she recalled. â€œIt said, â€˜Glass Menagerie, U.S.C.â€™ I said, â€˜What?â€™â€She called her counterparts in the universityâ€™s cinematic arts library, who found the reels. It turned out that they contained six hours, take after take. â€œNowhere did it say they added up to the production,â€ Ms. Klain said.She arranged to have the tapes restored and digitized at DC Video in Burbank, Calif. Then she turned to Mr. Wingate.Along the way, she made another discovery, of an audio recording of the broadcast, apparently made on a home tape recorder. By comparing sound patterns from the tape recording with the audio from the takes, he could figure out exactly what had gone into the broadcast.â€œIt was daunting,â€ he said. â€œSometimes they would use a part of this take and then they would use a part of that take. You would find a piece of it, and then it would go out of sync and youâ€™d realize you were hearing something from another take.â€Ms. Klain wanted the result seen and approached Mr. Tabesh of TCM.â€œWhen she calls and says â€˜Thereâ€™s this amazing program that only aired once and a lot of people are eager to see,â€™ I take that seriously,â€ he said, and he scheduled it without screening it himself: â€œI trust Janeâ€™s judgment enough to feel comfortable putting it on.â€Ms. Klain has not found her most-requested program, a 1967 production of â€œAnnie Get Your Gunâ€ starring Ethel Merman. Some years ago, she found the box that the master tape had apparently once been in. The box â€” in a storage vault leased by NBC, which had broadcast the program â€” was empty. On the label, â€œâ€˜Annie Get Your Gunâ€™ with Ethel Mermanâ€ had been crossed out.As for â€œThe Glass Menagerie,â€ Ms. Klain remembers watching the original broadcast in 1966, when she was a teenager. She disliked Miss Boothâ€™s performance so much that she threw something at the TV â€” an apple.Her assessment has not changed. Her reaction has.â€œIâ€™m a grown-up,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t throw things anymore. Also, my sofa is further away from the TV than we were then. Iâ€™d really miss with an apple.â€",1
"Mind Control vs. FreedomBy Jon Rappoport For several years now, all over America, schools have been exercising what they call zero tolerance policy to suspend young children packing suggestions of guns. Behind this practice is the idea that populations can be conditioned against owning real guns. Start early, indoctrinate the kids, and society will change. In turn, such thinking rests on the premise that human beings are Pavlovian dogs. Programmed biological machines. If the program currently running is faulty, and fails to obey the mandate of greatest good for the greatest number, change the program. As this Pavlovian approach expands and spreads, people begin to believe that a model of radical reconstruction is viable and good. For instance, how many people would now respond favorably to the idea that everyone can be programmed to forget guns even exist? Too far-out? Try this: How many people would agree to a program that guaranteed racial prejudice would be wiped from human memory? How many people would happily respond to the notion that environmental destruction, as an impulse, could be removed from the brain? How many of these people would even notice that such programs eliminate freedom and choice? And if they did notice, how many would care? The idea that you can obliterate bad parts of the brain and preserve the good parts is now embedded in standard science. It is childish, absurd, and dangerous to the extreme. Brain researchers are, on the whole, disinterested in law. They aim to create a new species for whom no laws will be needed. People will do the right thing, because their upgraded brains tell them to. Make no mistake about it, the technocrats/social engineers have a plan. They intend to program brains to fit their values-agenda. Whatever opposes that agenda is called a mental disorder, which needs to be corrected and erased. Selling their work as social progress, these self-appointed elites will attempt to shape brain activity so it fulfills a goal of cooperative impulse. That means people would never think of their own desires, but instead would serve the greater need of all. Automatically. No contemplation or independent thought necessary. Or required. Or possible. All present attempts to achieve this goalpeer pressure, legislation, coercion, politically correct language, surveillance, dumbed-down educationare crude stopgaps, and pale by comparison to brain reprogramming. The holy grail is a brain that cant consider consequences, or even choices. It merely responds to stimuli along narrow channels. For example, a clumsy indoctrination program which currently lasts four years in a progressive college could be installed in hours. The enemy of all this is: Freedom. Not only laws that protect it, but, more importantly, the understanding of it within the individual BY the individual. Has it occurred to you that virtually no college in America teaches a course in individual freedom? When you step back and think about that, you know how far the nation has descended into a morass of altruistic derangement. When enough individuals no longer care about their own expansive freedom and what it means and implies, the programmers have wonbecause then what difference does it make if one piece of brain software is substituted for another? And if the sales pitch promises comfort and ease and the eradication of anxiety, customers will flock to enroll. If a new steady-state hum of programmed brain activity reduces fear by replacing it with passive acceptance, who will notice the trade-off? Behind all the elite covert ops on the planet that induce violence and chaos, there is one intent: convince the population that humans are too dangerous to be allowed to live free. They must be adjusted. At which point, science steps in and says, The answer is here. And it is, unless more individuals understand what their own freedom means. And how profound it is.

"The Affordable Care Act has improved and expanded health insurance to cover millions more Americans. But it is far from perfect, and the sharp increase in premiums for plans sold under the program shows some of the problems that the next president and Congress need to fix.Premiums will increase by 25 percent on average for midlevel plans next year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, but most Americans will be largely insulated from price increases by federal subsidies. About 85 percent of the 10.5 million people who bought insurance through the online health exchanges this year received subsidies; that proportion is likely to increase in 2017 as premiums rise.Premiums are going up because many insurers underpriced plans when they started selling policies in 2013; not enough healthy, younger people signed up; and those who did used more medical care than the insurers had anticipated. As a result, companies like UnitedHealth and Aetna have stopped selling health plans in many parts of the country and the providers that remain have raised prices. Premiums have gone up most in states like Alabama, Arizona, Oklahoma and Tennessee that have three or fewer insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans.Premiums are rising much more modestly in states where there is more robust competition among insurers. For example, the average cost of the second-lowest â€œSilverâ€ level plan, the benchmark used by federal officials to analyze the market, will increase by 7 percent in California, 5 percent in New Jersey and 2 percent in Ohio.Even with the big premium increases, health experts say that plans on the exchanges generally cost less and provide access to more medical care than the plans that they replaced. All told, the law has helped 20 million people gain coverage, including those who became eligible for Medicaid and young adults allowed to stay on their parentsâ€™ policies, pushing the portion of the population without insurance to less than 10 percent for the first time in history. (About 150 million people are insured through employer plans.)With open enrollment starting on Nov. 1and ending on Jan. 31, the federal and state governments ought to make every effort to increase enrollment to spread the insurance risk over a larger population. For instance, of the 27.2 million people who still do not have health insurance, about 5.3 million are eligible for federal tax subsidies and may not realize it, according to a recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. People without health insurance will have a tax penalty of about $700 a year in 2017, up from about $400 in 2016. One way to lift enrollment would be to increase the penalty.Congress and the next president could further strengthen the health care law by offering subsidies to middle-income families who currently receive little or no help. Lawmakers should also consider applying to the health care exchanges the kind of reinsurance program Congress has used to encourage insurers to participate in Medicareâ€™s Part D prescription drug benefit program. The Affordable Care Actâ€™s flaws are fixable, but only if politicians from both parties work together in good faith.",1
"We are living in the age of hyper-anxiety. In response to the seismic and unsettling events of this year â€“ Brexit in the UK, the Trump election in the US, One Nation in Australia and terror attacks everywhere â€“ all the wellness blogs I subscribe to are advising people to mediate, practice craft, bake, talk to a friend or therapist if theyâ€™re feeling anxious and get back on the mat. Everything but get angry and take to the streets.   Related: So you want to get out of your bubble: try reading these conservative websites   The New York Times asked: Can Yoga Help Chase The Post Election Blues? Yoga studios, arts organisations and meditation centres are opening their doors to people afraid, anxious and worried after the most bitter election in recent memory. The last decade has seen the proliferation of mindfulness apps, yoga retreats, organic farm-to-table restaurants, Instagram yogi-celebs, $120 yoga pants, day spas and meditation classes. The wellness industrial complex is a symptom not just of the excesses of late capitalism (but the excesses are all about control and living forever â€“ inverse to say the excesses of 1980s, where it was all cocaine, and ponies and exotic islands) and a monetisation of the liberal, hippy project that started in the 1960s, when the Beatles went to India, and continued through the 70s. Most importantly â€“ at this juncture in time â€“ the obsession with â€œwellnessâ€ represents a flight away from the public fight into the self. The liberal, monied classes have helped turn the westernised version of yoga not just into an exercise to keep the body toned, but a defacto religion that melds eastern mysticism with a sort of revamped self-help therapy. The philosophy is to cool your anger, dude. You may not be able to do much about the world but you can â€œshow yourself loving kindnessâ€ and you can â€œmaster your breath, let the self be in bliss, contemplate on the sublime within you.â€ Anger is to be vanquished. Barbara Ehrenreichâ€™s Smile or Die: How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the World levels a similar charge at the insidiousness of positive thinking. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer she was told positive thinking could help cure her of the disease. She wondered, could the same mantras and pink ribbons also help a woman without health insurance cure the disease? The trend for positive thinking over activism for better and more equitable healthcare is a displacement of energy that can have fatal consequences. The wellness industrial complex can be just as harmful as the positive thinking industry. In the last 10 years we have seen the middle classes take flight into downward facing dog. Yoga is now big business. According to the Yoga Journal report, 20.4 million people practice yoga in the US, up from 15.8 million yoga practitioners in 2008. One in 10 Australia aged 14 and over practice yoga. In the UK, itâ€™s just over 1% of the population, although numbers are growing. The yoga market is now worth $30bn in the US and $80bn globally.    An article in the New York Times in 2011 a noted a disturbing social trend. Just as the women of the 1970s took flight into conscious raising groups, the workforce, divorce and zipless fucks, their daughters are also taking flight, but that flight is inwards â€“ to yoga.  The article glumly â€“ but correctly â€“ concludes:   ... thereâ€™s no sense that personal liberation is to be found by taking a more active role in the public world. Instead, making a home is re-encoded as a privilege, an accomplishment, even a form of freedom from the burdens and demands of the workplace ... For some of these women, such interiority seems to be a way to manage an unbearable sort of existential anxiety: a way to narrow the scope of lifeâ€™s challenges and demands.   If we all turn inward and abandon public duty, the world then turns a certain way, and not another. With the crumbling of progressive, liberal ideals, the rise of the alt-right, the denigration of women, Jews, people of colour and Muslims and all the ugliness of the recent US presidential election, itâ€™s so tempting to become enfolded into the soft comforts of the wellness industrial complex. It tells us we can control things: the in and out of our breath, the distractions, thoughts, feelings and ideas that try to colonise the mind when weâ€™re meant to be emptying it. The memes and the classes and the retreats and the podcasts and the swag can take up all our time and money. It can be a fulltime job, being well. But more important, it can stave off very real anxiety about the direction our society is travelling in. During the Nazi and later Stasi eras, the Germans spoke of â€œinternal migrationâ€. The barbarians were at the gate, and they seemed too powerful to fight, so you went in, or away, in your head. You drew the curtains, lit a fire, you listened to Mahler, you withdrew. We canâ€™t blame people for abandoning the barricades and leaving them to rust. In the west there was a widespread feeling of powerlessness following the protests to the invasion of Iraq in 2002 and 2003. Millions took to the streets all over the world â€“ with massive numbers in Paris, London, Washington DC, Melbourne and New York â€“ and it came to naught. According to the French academic Dominique ReyniÃ©, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.   Related: Family feud, election edition: Americans brace for Thanksgiving discord   Yet the biggest protests in the history of the world were ignored by those in power.  When this many people on the street become invisible to their governments, a contract or circuit breaks between the government and the people. Werenâ€™t widespread protests meant to change things?   It was like the air going out of the tyres. Protest â€“ the vehicle meant to transport us to another place â€“ just wasnâ€™t going anywhere. Itâ€™s like the government ghosted the people. After that, protests on the street came to resemble an activity for the lunatic fringe â€“ sound and fury that signified nothing. We rolled up our banners and rolled out our yoga mats. Namaste, dudes. Calmed and centred with all this yoga and meditation, itâ€™s time to take the next step. The time for action is now. Letâ€™s get up off our mats and unfurl those banners. And once more unto the breach. Brigid Delaney has written a book on the wellness industry to be published in June 2017.",1
"When people used to ask me, a serving police officer, how I was feeling, â€œOKâ€ became an easy phrase to use. It didnâ€™t show how much I was hiding.  I have worked for Essex police for more than 30 years. After 20 years of service, in 2013 my mental health started to decline. There were no big warning signs, no alarms, no sirens, just the start of a really difficult period of my life.  As a police officer, you see tough things. I started to have flashbacks to certain incidents I had encountered. I would feel sick as some memories flooded back. At other times I would feel an overwhelming sense of despair, feeling that life was just not worth it.    Alan Phillips: â€˜There were no big warning signsâ€™   In January 2014 I started to drink, a little too much most days. My behaviour at work became more erratic and on several occasions I was spoken to by supervisors. I wanted to tell them how I felt but I couldnâ€™t find the words. I gave little clues but these were not picked up on. When anyone asked me if anything was wrong, Iâ€™d always respond that I was OK.  Mentally, I crashed in April 2014. I spent a week-and-a-half unable to move, not washing, shaving or dressing, just staying in bed. I finally saw a doctor. Iâ€™d been off work nearly a week and my wife encouraged me to go. This wasnâ€™t the end of the problems â€“ I still live with stress, depression and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. But at the moment, Iâ€™m managing; Iâ€™m working. Iâ€™m open about my mental health now and that has changed a lot. Being in the police force can mean you encounter some difficult things. This condition is not because we are weak; thoughts of suicide are not a sign that you are a coward. This condition is one suffered by the strong. I have been involved with Mindâ€™s Blue Light programme from the beginning. Mindâ€™s research shows that nearly two-thirds (63%) of emergency service staff and volunteers have contemplated leaving their job or voluntary role because of stress or poor mental health.   Related: Police stress costs thousands of working days in Scotland   The Blue Light infoline offers vital support to people in the emergency services who may be experiencing similar feelings to the ones I had. It serves an important purpose.

"JARIASHENI, Georgia â€” Marked in places with barbed wire laid at night, in others by the sudden appearance of green signs declaring the start of a â€œstate borderâ€ and elsewhere by the arrival of bulldozers, the reach of Russia keeps inching forward into Georgia with ever more ingenious markings of a frontier that only Russia and three other states recognize as real.But while dismissed by most of the world as a make-believe border, the dirt track now running through this tiny Georgian village nonetheless means that Vephivia Tatiashvili can no longer go to his three-story house because it sits on land now patrolled by Russian border guards.That track marks the worldâ€™s newest and perhaps oddest international frontier â€” the elastic boundary between Georgian-controlled land and the Republic of South Ossetia, a self-proclaimed breakaway state financed, defended and controlled by Moscow.Mr. Tatiashviliâ€™s troubles started early in the summer when earth-moving equipment turned up without warning and started digging a wide track through an apple orchard and a field of wildflowers on the edge of the village. He was out at the time, so he avoided being trapped.There is no fence or barbed wire, but Mr. Tatiashvili does not dare to cross the track to visit his house for fear of being arrested, as his elderly neighbor was, by Russian border guards.â€œIt is too dangerous for me to go home,â€ he said, complaining that the boundary has become so mobile that nobody really knows its final destination. Mr. Tatiashvili now lives in his brotherâ€™s house, away from the border in the village center.The destitute mountainous area of South Ossetia first declared itself independent from Georgia in 1990, but nobody outside the region paid much attention until Russia invaded in August 2008 and recognized South Ossetiaâ€™s claims to statehood. With that, the territory joined Abkhazia in western Georgia, the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria and eastern Ukraine as a â€œfrozen zone,â€ an area of Russian control within neighboring states, useful for things like preventing a NATO foothold or destabilizing the host country at opportune moments.The leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, has said he plans to hold a referendum like the one in Crimea in 2014 on whether to request annexation by Russia.But even without a referendum, the nominally independent country is already Russian territory in all but name. It has its own small security force, but its self-declared frontiers are mainly guarded by Russiaâ€™s border service, an arm of the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet version of the K.G.B. It houses three Russian military bases with several thousand troops and, with no economy beyond a few farms, depends almost entirely on Russian aid for its survival.The green border signs that first appeared last year and now keep popping up along the zigzagging boundary warn that â€œpassage is forbiddenâ€ across what is declared to be a â€œstate border.â€ Which state is not specified, though locals are in no doubt about its identity.â€œRussia starts right here,â€ said Mr. Tatiashvili, pointing to the freshly dug track that separates his house from Georgian-held land.â€œBut who knows where Russia will start tomorrow or the next day,â€ he said. â€œIf they keep moving the line, we will one day all be living in a Russian-Georgian Federation.â€One of the new signs â€” written in English and Georgian â€” is just a few hundred yards from Georgiaâ€™s main east-west highway, and it puts a short part of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to a Georgian port on the Black Sea within territory controlled by Russia.So tangled is the dispute over what land belongs to which side that each has its own definition of the line. Russia and South Ossetia insist that it is a border like any other â€” Venezuela, Nicaragua and Nauru also recognize it â€” while Georgia calls it â€œthe occupation line.â€ The European Union, which has around 200 monitors in Georgia to keep tabs on the agreement that ended the 2008 Russian-Georgian war, also says there is no actual border, only an â€œadministrative boundary line.â€Kestutis Jankauskas, the head of the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia, said it was hard to know where this boundary line exactly runs. It was never recognized or agreed upon, and its location depends on which maps are used. Russia, he said, is using a map drawn by the Soviet militaryâ€™s general staff in the 1980s.It demarcates what in the Soviet era was an inconsequential administrative boundary within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia but what is now hardening into a hazardous frontier.The fitful movement of the boundary seems to be driven mostly by Russiaâ€™s desire to align what it sees as a state border with this old Soviet map. So far, the movement has always been forward, often by just a few yards but at other times by bigger leaps.Because the line is so uncertain and, in many places, still completely unmarked, Georgian villagers sometimes find themselves on the wrong side and under arrest by Russian border guards or local security officers.To help get people out of detention, recover cattle that have strayed into Russian-controlled land and settle quotidian disputes like who owns which apple trees or vineyard, Europeâ€™s monitoring mission organizes a monthly meeting of Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian officials.As happened when the two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine declared themselves independent states in 2014 and said they would like to be absorbed by Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin has mostly feigned ignorance of what his countryâ€™s surrogates are up to in Georgia.Asked in April about South Ossetiaâ€™s plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia, Mr. Putin suggested that Moscow was mostly a bystander. But if South Ossetia wants to hold a referendum, Mr. Putin said, â€œwe cannot resist it.â€While Russian military, border and diplomatic personnel have poured into South Ossetia, the local population of Ossetians â€” an ethnic group whose language is distantly related to Persian â€” has steadily drifted away, shrinking by around half from a prewar level of roughly 70,000. An ethnic Georgian population of around 25,000 who used to live there have long since fled.Like Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, the border markings deep into what Georgia insists is its territory are slowly creating â€œfacts on the groundâ€ that, no matter what the international community might think, are a reality that everyone has to deal with, particularly residents.Elizbar Mestumrishvili, 75, a farmer who lives next to Mr. Tatiashviliâ€™s now-marooned house, can still get to his home, as it lies on the Georgian side of the new dirt track.But he is wary of going to the bottom of his garden, which lies within a 60-yard frontier zone that Russian and South Ossetian security officers claim the right to patrol. Pointing to a row of vines drooping with plump grapes, he said it was unwise to walk any farther because â€œthey might come and set up a border post.â€The so-called borderization of a previously vague administrative boundary created political headaches for Georgiaâ€™s government ahead of parliamentary elections on Oct. 8. It still won the election but had to fend off attacks from rivals who said it had responded too meekly to Russiaâ€™s â€œcreeping annexation.â€When it defeated supporters of former President Mikheil Saakashvili in elections four years ago, a coalition led by Georgian Dream, a party set up by an enigmatic billionaire, pledged to reduce tensions with Russia, which loathed Mr. Saakashvili. Instead, Russian border guards have moved deeper into Georgian territory.â€œThere is no improvement. I would say the opposite,â€ Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili said in an interview. â€œUnfortunately, Russia never appreciates when you concede or make a step forward or compromise. They always take it for granted.â€All the same, he insisted that even though his government had no intention of repeating Mr. Saakashviliâ€™s disastrous 2008 attempt to confront Russia militarily, the border will not last.â€œIt has no prospect,â€ he said. â€œThey are trying to build this border, these fences, inside our country. We think it is temporary.â€",1
"A globe-trotting Taiwanese dentist has won the Philippines-based Gusi Peace Prize for providing free medical services to disadvantaged people around the world. Liu Chi-chun, president of the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) , received the honor in a ceremony held in Manila Wednesday evening, making him the first Taiwanese citizen ever to obtain the award since its inception in 2002. Liu was commended for his international humanitarianism as he has led like- minded Taiwanese medical professionals and volunteers to provide free medical treatment and healthcare in remote regions in more than 20 countries since he founded the TRMPC in 1995. The dentist took part in more than 95 percent of the 200-plus overseas healthcare missions the non-governmental altruistic organization has conducted over the past 14 years. Wu Hsiang-ping, Liu's work partner in the Philippines, recommended Liu for the Gusi Peace Prize's 'international humanitarianism' award for his services that transcend geographical, political, racial, cultural and religious boundaries. In his acceptance speech, Liu said peace is not achieved with words, but rather with deeds. One tends to do many things in one's life and if some of those things are done for the interests of others, not oneself, it would directly or indirectly contribute to world peace, he added. Liu told the selfnews after the awards ceremony that free healthcare services are his corps' core mission. 'We will continue carrying out this pursuit and welcome other like-minded people to join our ranks,' Liu said. In addition to overseas missions, the TRMPC has also provided free medical treatment for Taiwanese people residing in remote villages. The Gusi Peace Prize was established by Filipino celebrity Barry Sotejo Gusi in 2002 in remembrance of his father. The prize mainly recognizes prominent international figures who have worked for world peace and human rights. The prize and the Ramon Magsaysay Award have become the Philippines' two most prestigious international awards. Besides Liu, 18 other altruistic celebrities from the United States, Thailand, Malaysia, Romania, Cerupus, Paraguay, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Hong Kong and Macau were also awarded for their outstanding services in the legislative, judicial, medical, environmental, musical, educational, artistic and scientific fields. Noted Chinese-American forensic expert Henry Lee received the prize last year, but he was awarded as an American, not as a Taiwanese citizen. ",1
"Steve Reich celebrates his 80th birthday today. Together with Terry Riley and Philip Glass, he was one of the founders of minimalism in the 1960s, and he has been at the forefront of American music ever since. The succession of utterly distinctive works Reich has composed in the last half century includes some of the most remarkable music of our time, their influence continues to cross continents and almost all musical boundaries. Here are 10 highlights, mapping a remarkable creative career. Itâ€™s Gonna Rain (1965)    Where it all began, when Reich was playing around with a tape loop of a revivalist preacher shouting â€œItâ€™s gonna rain!â€, playing it back simultaneously on two machines, one running slightly faster than the other. As the two tapes moved out of phase, and eventually back together again, he noticed the teasingly ambiguous range of rhythmic and tonal effects created. It became the basis of a tape piece, and phasing was born. Piano Phase (1967)    After a series of tape pieces Reich made the crucial switch to working with live instruments, applying the phasing techniques he had perfected in the studio to sequences of pitches played on two pianos moving steadily in and out of sync, generating an ever-changing sequence of unexpected shapes and gestures along the way. Drumming (1970-71)    In 1970 Reich won a scholarship to study west African drumming techniques in Ghana. On his return to the US he put what he had learnt into his most ambitious work to date. Drumming shows that the techniques of minimalism heâ€™d been developing could be used as the basis of large-scale musical structures all derived from a single tiny rhythmic cell. The result is one of the enduring classics of pure minimalism. Music for 18 Musicians (1976)    Not only Reichâ€™s greatest achievement, but one of the landmarks of 20th-century music, Music for 18 Musicians is a richly exuberant and alluring ensemble piece, which gives the pulsing layers of his instrumental writing a genuinely expressive and harmonically meaningful large-scale architecture, and demonstrated that minimalism was so much more than an ephemeral musical fashion. Tehillim (1981)    In his earlier works Reich used voices as more or less an instrumental tone colour, embedding them as another strand in his pulsing textures. But in the psalm settings of Tehillim, the first work in which Reich explored his Jewish heritage, a quartet of womenâ€™s voices takes centre stage for the first time, in music that derives its rhythms from the inflections of the Hebrew text, which is delivered without vibrato in a timeless way. The Desert Music (1984)    Reich has composed relatively few pieces for full orchestra, generally preferring to work with smaller ensembles that can more easily achieve the high levels of precision his music demands. The Desert Music, though, is one of his grandest conceptions, using a chorus and a huge orchestra for settings of poems by William Carlos Williams that trace out a 45-minute arch form. Different Trains (1988)    Both a memory of the train journeys across the US that Reich undertook as a child in the 1940s, and a reflection that had he grown up in Europe, as a Jew Reichâ€™s train journeys would have been very different, Different Trains is perhaps the most personal of his works. It marked a return to the use of sampling, using train whistles and interviews with Holocaust survivors and US train workers as part of an electronic soundtrack thatâ€™s juxtaposed with string-quartet writing derived from the speech rhythms on tape. Three Tales (2002)    Reich and his wife, the video artist Beryl Korot, made their first foray into music theatre with The Cave in 1993, an exploration of the Old Testament story of Abraham combining interviews and documentary film with Reichâ€™s music. Four years later they completed a far more ambitious video triptych â€“ Hindenburg, Bikini and Dolly â€“ examining the impact of technology on life in the 20th century. Double Sextet (2007)    The piece that won Reich the 2009 Pulitzer prize for music, which may either by played by two identical groups of winds, strings, vibraphone and piano, or with one of the sextet pre-recorded on tape. The pairs of pianos and vibraphones provide the driving impulse and map out the tonal shifts of the music, while the other instruments pick out melodic shapes above them. Radio Rewrite (2012)    Reichâ€™s influence on successive generations of pop musicians has been profound, and in turn he has always been aware of that influence and appreciates it. Radio Rewrite repays that compliment by using a pair of songs by Radiohead, Jigsaw Falling Into Place, and Everything in its Right Place, as the basis for a five-movement work for an 11-piece ensemble.",1

"NSA scandal: the deepest secret of the Ed Snowden operationJon Rappoport When that hero emerges from the shadows and says all the right things, and when he exposes a monolithic monster, hes irresistible. However, that doesnt automatically make him who he says he is. That doesnt automatically exempt him from doubts. Because hes doing the right thing, people quickly make him into a spokesman for their own hopes. If hes finally blasting a hole in the dark enemys fortress, he has to be accepted at face value. He has to be elevated. When dealing with the intelligence community and their spooks and methods, this can be a mistake. Deception is the currency of that community. Layers of motives and covert ops are business as usual. In previous articles, Ive raised a number of specific doubts about Ed Snowden. Here I want to replay four statements Snowden made and examine them. When you see everything, you see them on a more frequent basis and you recognize that some of these things are actually abuses, and when you talk about them in a place like this [NSA]over time that awareness of wrongdoing sorts of builds up and you feel compelled to talk about it, and the more you talk about it, the more youre ignored, the more youre told its not a problem As Steve Kinney, writing at the Centre for Research on Globalisation points out, Snowden would have raised all sorts of red flags about himself. If he hadnt been fired outright, he certainly would have come under serious scrutiny, which, at the very least, would have reduced his ability to hack documents out of NSAs most secret recesses. And yet, Snowden, an analyst, claims he had access to full rosters of everyone working at the NSA, the entire intelligence community and undercover assets all around the world, the locations of every station we have, what their missions are and so forth. Really? That stretches doubt far beyond the point of credulity. Both The Guardian and the Washington Post supposedly vetted Snowden carefully. Id really like to see the results of that vetting. Rosters of everyone working at the NSA [and] the entire intelligence community Thats untold thousands of people. Thats referring to many separate agencies. Snowden doesnt stop there. He maintains the security of NSA is not just a sieve, its also thousands of separate hunting parties, undertaken at the whim of any analyst: Any analyst at any time can target anyone. Any selector, anywhere I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President Sure. NSA just opens the door to their own analysts, who can, on their own hook, launch spying episodes on anyone in the US. Boom. No operational plans, no coordination. A free-for-all. Hey, dig this. Nancy Pelosi was just talking to her hairdresser. Im going to follow up on her. Think Ill spy on Nancy and her husband, see what theyre up to. Ill file reports as I go along A guy at Los Alamos just wrote to his boss about a new weapons system. Want to see what theyre planning? Finally, Snowden claimed he could shut down the surveillance system in an afternoon. But thats not my intention. Not just spy on everybody in the US. Snowden asserts he could do that. But he could also make the entire spying apparatus of NSA (and even all other intelligence agencies?) go dark with a few hours of workand hed evade notice of his NSA bosses as he performed this herculean task. No. Ridiculous. The very first thing an agency like NSA does is set up a labyrinth to prevent itself from being taken down. Consider these four Snowden statements together, back up and think. These are propositions that cast the man into a deep pit of doubt. Who is he? What is his mission? Is that mission his own, or is he working for someone who wants to punch a hole in the NSA? In another article, Ive developed the hypothesis that Snowden is still actually operating for his former bosses at the CIA; people at the CIA, long engaged in a turf war with the NSA, are running him in this op. Snowden didnt steal anything from NSA. He couldnt. People at the CIA could and did steal, and they handed him documents to use in his assigned op. There are other possible explanations. None of them exonerates the NSA or what it is doing. Lets be clear about that. But how far would the CIA go in exposing the guts of the NSA? Its clear that these intelligence agencies overlap in their efforts (crimes). Therefore, the CIA would be satisfied to smear the NSA without exposing too much. If so, Snowdens cache of documents wont go all the way. His documents wont yield the longed-for holy grail, though Snowden implies he could unwrap it. Im talking about the entire interlocking system of US and global surveillance and how it is built. More than piecemeal exposures about PRISM, US hacks of China, and the G20 meeting in England, an account of the technical architecture, as John Young of Cryptome rightly calls it, would torpedo the underlying global Surveillance State. If Snowden can do that, he hasnt shown it so far. Right now, hes put his work in the hands of several journalists, who will dole it out on their own inexplicable timetables. Why make that move? Why hasnt Snowden put up a dozen sites and laid everything he has on the line? Before those sites could be taken down, the material would have been copied and sent around the world thousands of times. Snowden has already said he wont endanger specific spies or operations that could actually prevent terrorists missions. All right. Then give us everything else. Give us the whole shooting match. Lets see how the watchers have built their edifice. But so far, Snowden has shown himself to be a different kind of person, someone who makes claims that far exceed his reach. Read his four statements again. The sub-text is: I could complain, raise doubts, and criticize NSA openly at work. No one cared. It was a typical office youd find in any company. It certainly wasnt a super-controlled environment. Things were so loose, I could access the complete map of the entire NSA network. Names, places, operations. On a whim, any analyst could spy on anyone in the US. If I wanted to, I could shut down all of US intelligence in a few hours. Forget the popular image of NSA as a fortress with dozens of layers of protection. Forget the notion that Id have to be granted elite privilege to all sorts of secret keys to get into the inner sanctum, or that, while navigating my way in, Id be setting off alarm bells all over the place. It was a piece of cake. Smear. NSA is an open book. A book written by idiots. It cost a trillion dollars, but anyone could waltz in there and read the whole thing. Use a thumb drive, and you can also walk out with the whole thing. If you set aside Snowdens remarks about his motives, his morality, and his high mission, his explanation falls apart. It makes no sense. His CIA handlers would now be telling him that. Hey Ed, tone down the childs-play angle, okay? Youre making it sound too easy. Remember? Youre the whiz kid genius. Yeah, we want to smear NSA, but its got to be credible. People have to think it took at least some ingenuity to access the most heavily protected data in the world. Get it? A common man of the people, serving the greater good, exposing ongoing crimes that threaten the very lifeblood of the Republic? Is Ed Snowden that hero? Or is he an operator, an agent? So far, hes made himself seem like the agent. Executives at the NSA are well aware of this. Sitting down with their counterparts at the CIA, theyd be getting an earful. CIA people would be saying: Of course Snowden is our boy. He worked for us in Geneva, and hes working for us now. We told you, after 9/11, we didnt like you clowns at NSA throwing all the blame on CIA for the Trade Center attacks. We didnt like that at all. And in the intervening years, we havent liked you cutting us out of the spying game. We warned you. So now weve given you a taste of what we can do. We can do more. Either we play ball together, or well put NSA in the dumper. Get it? Playing ball together. Harmonization. A sharp reader has just pointed out to me that this is the op behind the op. The fallout from Snowden will be used as the reason for more and better global sharing of spying and surveillance data. Separate Surveillance States, which already share mountains of data, will come together to coordinate their efforts in an even tighter Surveillance Planet. The US NSA wont be tolerated as the pompous king of the hill any longer. It will have to play well with others. After all, Globalism means the whole globe. And were all in this together. We meaning the elites who want to track every move made by every person on Earth, 24/7, in order to predict and control in the new paradise, where the sun rises every day on compliance. Thats the takeaway from the Snowden affair. Thats why the secret surveillance/spying at the G20 meeting in England was exposed. Gentlemen, were all rational here at the table. This is ridiculous. Were all spying on each other. This cant go on. Its counterproductive. We want to work together. So lets do it. We all want the same thing. A planet under control. The way to achieve that goal is to cooperate. Well spy on those who need to be spied on: the population of the planet. Well do it together. The primary violator of cooperation is that cowboy outfit in America, the NSA. They have to be brought into line. They have to learn theyre only part of the Whole. Agreed? Agreed.

"Tobacconists, estate agents and jewellers are taking over high streets across Britain as the number of shops in the country falls at its fastest rate for four years. There were 15 shop closures a day across the UK in the first half of 2016 and the number of new openings has fallen to the lowest level for five years, according to a report that highlights the pressure on the retail sector. Fashion shops are struggling, with 206 closing in the first half of the year and only 119 opening, leading to a net decline of 87. In contrast, tobacconists increased by a net of 28, with 60 openings and 32 closures, while estate agents added 26 sites and jewellers 24. The period covered by the report, which was produced by accountancy firm PwC and the Local Data Company, includes the collapse of BHS into administration. However, the last 22 of BHSâ€™s 164 shops did not close until the end of August. Matthew Hopkinson, the director of the Local Data Company, said: â€œThe spaces left by the traditional occupants of our high streets are being increasingly filled by health care operators, food and beverage operators and the ongoing rise of the discounters.â€ Last week, in a further blow to the high street, Gap announced it was pulling its Banana Republic brand out of the UK, which will result in the closure of eight shops. Kantar Worldpanel, the consumer research firm, also warned that fashion sales in Britain were falling at the steepest rate since the financial crisis, with shoppers spending Â£700m less on clothing, shoes and accessories in the year to 25 September compared with 2015. High streets across the UK are under pressure from a shift in spending from physical shops to online, a squeeze on household income, and increases in business rates and the national living wage, which has increased costs. Richard Hyman, a retail analyst, said there were too many shops in Britain. About 64% of retailers in Britain were holding sales last week as they tried to shift unsold stock, according to research conducted by Hyman.   Related: Streets without shops: how apps are transforming our local neighbourhoods   â€œThis is the toughest retail market we have ever seen by some distance,â€ he said. â€œBut we have seen nothing yet; next year will be worse. I have been going on about this for ages, but there is oversupply. Their are too many shops and online shops. â€˜Build it and they will comeâ€™ might be true in Field of Dreams, but in business you canâ€™t carry on doing that. We have got the most promotional market that anyone has ever seen.â€ The PwC and Local Data Company report found that 2,656 outlets closed on Britainâ€™s high streets in the first half of the year. This was a rate of 15 stores a day, up from 14 a day in the same period in 2015. New openings fell from 2,197 to 2,153, the lowest since 2011. This meant that a net 503 shops disappeared from high streets during the period, the biggest decline since the first half of 2012. Greater London saw the biggest net drop in the country as 164 shops were lost. The report claimed that retailers may be preparing for an increase in business rates from next year. No area of the UK enjoyed an increase in the number of shops, although the north-east of England lost just five.",1
"Study Shows That Child Chemo Survivors Face Debilitating Health Problems Later OnHeather Callaghan A 17-year-old was strapped down and forcefully injected chemo toxins against her express wishes after it went before a judge. Likewise, an Ohio childrens hospital caught dosing a 10-year-old Amish girl with experimental chemotherapy drugs got a judge to uphold an order to keep up the life-saving procedure. The family left the country for her recovery with alternative methods. The unfortunate truth is that judges setting these violating precedents could be sentencing children to debilitating health problems later on or a shortened life. According to Northwestern University, the number of U.S. childhood cancer survivors has increased but most of the survivors past the five-year mark face chronic health problems related to treatment. The study by Northwestern Medicine, National Cancer Institute and St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital was published April 1 in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.It is the first to estimate the prevalence of treatment-related chronic disease among survivors of childhood cancer at a national level. In 2011 there were around 400,000 childhood cancer survivors 60,000 more than in 2005. Previous research also shows a shortened life and weakened quality of life for childhood cancer survivors who had chemo. However, the stats for health outcomes are head-spinning: Surviving cancer is not enough for lead author Siobhan Phillips who says: The magnitude of diseases at relatively young ages is quite striking, since you would not expect many of these diseases to be a problem in the general population until much older ages. [] We need a more coordinated approach to their care to help prevent or delay some of these chronic health problems that affect the quality of their lives. We want them to thrive, not simply survive. One would hope that the goal goes beyond mere delay of chronic health problems as a child cancer survivor has suffered unbearably through enough. Dr. Greg Armstrong, principal investigator of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study said: These facts should challenge all of us in the field not to be content simply with improving lifespan, but to dedicate the future of this field to improving the health span of our survivors. Indeed, the numbers game played with survivorship has been truly unkind to chemo survivors of all ages. Please bookmark and share this article, especially when the topic of mandatory chemotherapy arises and demand better health services. For all the people who say but Science says or evidence-based need to understand that better Western measures are possible if corporate money is removed as a factor. Incentives should be freely given for finding lifelong CURES, not stifling sick-care measures. Ask science worshipers if these stats are really the best that can be offered children after decades of research and untold billions of dollars. This is proof that medical dictators and judges have no right to decide whats best for a minors health and that their actions, which are based on drive-by knowledge and hearsay, could injure, kill and rob a child of their future health. Under any other circumstances, those would be charges of child abuse, kidnapping, child endangerment and homicide. The cases, which involve a consumer health service, should never make it to the courts in the first place. Judges, drug makers, and hospital personnel are not authorities over your health or your life. Not one iota. Heather Callaghan is a natural health blogger and food freedom activist.

Recent posts byHeather Callaghan: Its NOT just child Chemo / Cancer survivors who suffer from debilitating issues later in life. I witness the debilitating issues on a daily basis in my wife who had Cancer and the subsequent Radiation and Chemotherapy to supposedly treat this illness and it ranges from bone weakness to rotting teeth and with the crap insurance companies these days she has to deal with daily pain and suffering because they WONT PAY for ANYTHING! But, if she needed psychotropic meds, that they will pay for. This is barbaric at best. Chemo is so toxic that nurses must wear thick gloves or it will burn them if they spill it, yet it is being injected directly into your veins. What patients dont know is that most chemo has very high levels of fluoride [rat poison] in it. This is why you end up with the memory loss, rotting teeth [bone becomes brittle ], organ failures.

"Turkeys Call For Safe Zones In Syria Are Based On Problem Turkey Helped CreateBy Brandon Turbeville Turkey has called Article 4 NATO meetings twice once in 2003 and once in 2013. In the latter incident, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United states sent two PATRIOT anti-missile batteries each as well as soldiers trained in the operation of those missiles. Turkey is now requesting help with its border security due to the crisis in Syria and one can only wonder what the response of the rest of NATO will be when the meeting concludes. Article 4 allows any member of NATO to request assistance when its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. Ironically, the crisis in Syria in particular, the issue surrounding the Turkish-Syrian border was largely the fault of Turkey itself as it helped train and funnel terrorists from inside its borders into Syria. Thus, the crisis is entirely one of its own making. As Tony Cartalucci writes in his article Implausible Deniability: Wests ISIS Terror Hordes In Iraq, ISIS was harbored on NATO territory, armed and funded by US CIA agents with cash and weapons brought in from the Saudis, Qataris, and NATO members themselves. The non-lethal aid the US and British sent including the vehicles we now see ISIS driving around in. Cartalucci states in a separate article, NATOs Terror Hordes In Iraq A Pretext For Syria Invasion, Cartalucci is referring to a cross-border invasion that was coordinated with NATO, Turkey, Israel, and the death squads where Israel acted as air force cover while Turkey facilitated the death squad invasion from inside its own borders. Keep in mind also that, prior to the rapid appearance and seizure of territory by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, European media outlets like Der Spiegel reported that hundreds of fighters were being trained in Jordan by Western intelligence and military personnel for the purpose of deployment in Syria to fight against Assad. The numbers were said to be expected to reach about 10,000 fighters when the reports were issued in March, 2013. Although Western and European media outlets would try to spin the operation as the training of moderate rebels, subsequent reports revealed that these fighters were actually ISIS fighters. Those fighters were ultimately funneled into Syria via Turkey. In addition, on October 2, 2014, Turkeys parliament passed a resolution to allow the Turkish military to enter the sovereign territory of Iraq and Syria under the pretext of battling Western-backed IS militants. The resolution also allowed foreign troops to use Turkish territory for the same purpose suggesting that the Incirlik air base may soon be used by the United States for its airstrikes against Syria. Only recently, it was reported by Turkish media that a formal agreement was reached between the United States and Turkey for the use of Incirlik in the faux American campaign against ISIS. The vote on the resolution regarding foreign troops on Turkish soil (to be used in Syria) was 298 in favor of the motion and 98 opposed. Despite its claims that the vote was centered around defeating ISIS on its borders, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, perhaps inadvertently, admitted that the real target of NATO aggression is the Syrian government. As the BBC reports, While he said an effective struggle against IS would be a priority for Turkey, the immediate removal of the administration in Damascus would also continue to be its priority. Erdogan also called for a buffer zone on the Turkey/Syria border which would be enforced by a no-fly zone to ensure security. A buffer zone, of course, has been part of the NATO agenda against Syria since the beginning of the Western-controlled crisis in the country. Remember, it was under the guise of a humanitarian corridor or buffer zone in Libya, that NATO bombing took place which ultimately led to the destruction of the Libyan government, the murder of Ghaddaffi, and the subsequent expansion of chaos, anarchy, and genocide across the entire North African country. Indeed, public discussion of the implementation of a buffer zone began as far back as 2012 when the Brookings Institution, in their memo Assessing Options For Regime Change stated The Brookings Institution went further, however, describing a possible scenario that mirrors the one currently unfolding in Syria where Turkey, in coordination with Israel, could help overthrow Assad by establishing a multi-front war on Syrias borders. Brookings writes, Turkey has been whining and groaning for some time over an influx of Syrian refugees as a result of a humanitarian crisis that it helped create with its support and facilitation of Islamic fundamentalist death squad forces funded by the West and allowed to travel into Syria through Turkeys borders. The most recent influx of refugees came from the city of Kobani, where ISIS fighters were herded by American airstrikes for the purposes of reinforcing the fighters already battling Kurdish and Syrian forces there. Subsequent refugee influxes came from other border-lying towns facing heavy fighting. As Tony Cartalucci commented in his own article Turkey Preparing For Syria Occupation? Clearly, the Turkish agenda is not focused on combating ISIS. If it was, the Turks would have long ago sealed their borders with Syria as well as ceased their training and facilitation of terrorist groups flowing into Syria from Turkish territory. Turkey is not requesting assistance for spillover violence or cross-border attacks, it is requesting a military invasion using a problem Turkey helped create to begin with as justification for such an operation. The Turks do not need NATO Buffer Zones to end terrorism within their own country. They need to seal the borders with Syria, immediately cease funding, training, and facilitation of terrorists operating inside Turkish borders alongside a massive sting operation netting and eliminating these organizations. Turkey would also greatly benefit by backing away from Erdogan, his idiotic policies, and his equally idiotic Islamist government. Turkey must put aside political Islam and return to a culture of secular governance. Lastly, Turkey must pursue a reasonable and fair policy toward the Kurds in its Southeast. Of course, Turkey has sent every signal possible to announce that they intend to stick with the NATO line of destroying the secular government of Bashar al-Assad and replacing it with a government or governments beholden and favorable to Washington and the Anglo-American oligarchy. Obviously, a buffer zone and/or a no-fly zone, of course, is tantamount to war and an open military assault against the sovereign secular government of Syria because the implementation of such a zone would require airstrikes against Assads air defense systems. With the establishment of this buffer zone, a new staging ground will be opened that allows terrorists such as ISIS and others the ability to conduct attacks even deeper inside Syria. While the goal is clearly to establish such a zone before tightening the grip on Assad even further and ultimately leading to his overthrow, one can only wonder as to what pronouncement or policy will result from the Tuesday NATO meeting. Whatever it may be, the Syrian people will be the ones to pay the highest price. Recently from Brandon Turbeville: Brandon Turbeville is an author out of Florence, South Carolina.

Yes, Turkey helped create the problem in hopes of being able to use the problem to justify eliminating Assad and the Kurds, something they have desired for a long time. Do they have an Ottoman Empire Sequel fantasy going on? crossing and attacking anyone or anything within the exterior borders of a sovereign nation is an act of war, against that sovereign nation! Turkey is nothing more than a CIA PUPPET, they are doing as they are TOLD! Like a good lap dog! Erdogan to NATO: Broken Arrow!!! NATO, the evil Empire. ",0
"Who Created ISIS? The Enemy-Revealing Question That De-masks the Empires Facade For GoodBy Bernie Suarez Think of the entire database of freely available information as an objective tangible item. Then think of the process of analyzing that information again as an objective process. Only when thinking of information in this manner can we look at issues (i.e. government-mainstream media propaganda and storylines) that effectively are crippling humanity and see that these issues are engineered by the State. Well see that these issues are designed, orchestrated and carried out by the ruling elite. And well observe how the easily-fooled mass segments of humanity fall for the tricks and the lies and subsequently suffer all the days of their life because of these lies. One of the major engineered issues today stifling humanitys sense of wellness, safety and personal comfort for over two long years now continues to be the issue of Islamic State or ISIS terrorism. The image below represents how the ISIS stories often fall under the category of fictional two-dimensional reality. Though many accept it as such, these stories often have no physical reality to it. Instead the tales exists in the two-dimensional artificial (imaginative) format. This is not to say there arent men being paid and armed to fight under what we in America call the ISIS brand, Im saying the story of ISIS were told by the mass media is carefully crafted, has no tangible reality to it and has never held up to the reality test. No topic has collectively been written about more by the global community of journalists, researchers and writers over the past two years than ISIS. No topic has been more forcefully imposed on humanity more than ISIS. As a result two distinct paradigms are now observed: those who believe ISIS is the over-the-top threat to humanity that the mainstream media describes and those who see the facts and accounts collected over the years which shows a clear trail of ISIS being a full creation of the United States Intelligence with the support of some of its NATO partners. So in order to solve the ISIS psychological operation once and for all and offer hope, safety, reason, normality and warmth to humanity lets expand our way of thinking today and think ahead for a change. Rather than writing about something that is happening only now, lets put things out in multiple dimensions incorporating all three tenses; the past, the present and the future. Now lets apply this broad and multi-dimensional thinking to solving the problem of ISIS. For example, when we consider the ISIS psyop on the world that mostly began in 2014, why dont we take a full look at the problem and see if we can walk ourselves through to the end of this problem and beyond. If we do this properly we should free ourselves of not only the usual fear and chaos the State wants you to live in, but well free ourselves of unrealistic solutions, false hope and false expectations regarding how to solve the ISIS problem. Well then be able to finally see ISIS for what it is. In other words, there is enough information freely available to the global community to solve this riddle and we know enough about the mind of the ruling elite and what their goals are to be able to once and for all not only delete ISIS or any other terror group from our selective consciousness but well be able to accurately predict potential future scenarios with high probability. In a perfect world of course, deleting ISIS involves deleting the process that created ISIS and exposing the real criminals that represent ISIS. And this, of course, is intricately connected to predicting future scenarios and achieving all the healing were striving for. In order to achieve this point of consciousness and to truly finally move humanity forward as a whole well begin by briefly reviewing the facts about the ISIS story which many truth seekers are already familiar with and well show how the bad habits many Americans have developed (of believing government-mainstream media lies) doesnt allow them to see or confront the reality of ISIS. This disease (of holding on to mainstream media lies told to us about ISIS) is now (I believe) one of the most crippling realities that threatens the future well-being of America and the rest of the world. Lets approach this topic in various phases for the sake of clarity. Today information that would otherwise never be available years ago is now free and available to all to confirm for themselves. The most difficult challenge for the new world order and the ruling elite is (as globalist head honcho and strategist Zbigniew Brzezinski has openly admitted) that the freely available information and thus the populace resistance is a threat to external control of the masses and is thus making their new world order plans impossible. Understanding the nature of this freely available and easily verified information thus becomes the strength of this argument. People who still believe mainstream media controlled news live in a paradigm where mainstream media itself represents the full balance of freely available information and for someone to believe that something claimed by mainstream media is untrue somehow requires extraordinary proof. All mass media claims are thus given a default label of truth until proven otherwise. This entirely delusional ministry of truth badge of honor is not only unfounded as nothing could be further from the truth, but it is quietly one of the most important paralyzing beliefs that is keeping humanity in its diseased and enslaved state. First there was the 9/11/01 100% proven false flag operation to strip away our liberties, followed by the creation of the police state and the surveillance state. Then there was the revealed preliminary PNAC battle plans of Rebuilding Americas Defenses drafted prior to 9/11 clearly showing the goal was to give the US military global domination. This domination plan was quickly revealed to the world in the fully organic three-dimensional reality by General Wesley Clark when he openly admitted his conversation with Pentagon officials just a few weeks after 9/11 revealed the plan to destroy seven countries in five years in the Middle East, those seven countries would be Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Anyone can objectively observe that the seven-countries-in-five-years plan has been attempted, albeit with failures, on the part of the Wests new world order. Understanding the events of the past 15 years including the rise of ISIS will help put this seven-countries-in-five-years plan and the role of ISIS into perspective. Its amazing how over the past eight years or so weve been hearing about US Israeli or Saudi Arabian bombing campaigns associated to ISIS (or Hezbollah) terrorism almost exclusively in these countries. Then in 2007 it was revealed by journalist Seymour Hersh that the US had deliberately changed course in Iraq to one that had nothing to do with liberating the Iraqi people. That the false claims of WMD turned out to be a lie just like the they took the babies out of the incubators lie of 1990 to invade Kuwait was not a coincident. The invasion of Iraq was complete, Saddam was murdered, Baghdad looted, what more can a criminal military force ushering their new century of military might want? General Clark had already hinted years prior what the strategy would be when he said that he was told by Pentagon officials that (paraphrasing) when all you have is a hammer everything has to look like a nail. And so by 2007 this next phase of the PNAC Bush Neocon plans revealed by Hersh, the redirection strategy phase was well underway. The plan was to create infighting and sectarian warfare to seal the doom of the nation state of Iraq, empower their proxy army (al Qaeda in Iraq later renamed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL then ISIS) and start arming and funding the armies who would usher in the next level of destruction of the targeted Middle East nation states. This was not only part of the PNAC plans after all, but these plans mightily resembled a major part of Zionist Israels Greater Israel plans suggested by Oded Yinon in his 1982 article for breaking up some of Israels neighboring countries. More documents would later be revealed by Judicial Watch (2015) on how the Defense Intelligence Agency had documented plans to accomplish this breakup of specified nation states (specifically Iraq and Syria) with the support of groups like the Salifist, al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood in Iraq, sectarian terrorist groups that are indistinguishable from the Islamic State proxy army and terror groups that US documents clearly indicate the US would support for the sake of their greater Middle East plans. All of this is clear undeniable and on the record for anyone who wants to do their own research. Armies are useless unless they have lots of guns, ammunition and military weapons. This is why after creating the strengthened home base for ISIS in Iraq consistent with the redirection strategy, key events and operations had to be put into place to move those weapons into the actual hands of the ISIS (al Qaeda, Al Nusra, moderate rebels) proxy army. Several important events planned by the ruling elite and their US military using their foreign born puppet president were the illegal invasion and destruction of Libya in 2011. This would create another huge platform to build ISIS by shipping weapons to them from Benghazi. This operation would blow up in their face on September 11, 2012 and whistleblowers would blow the lid on the illegal gun-running operation designed to put weapons into the hands of ISIS fighters by shipping them from Libya to Syria via Turkey. Another mass weapons cache would be handed (literally!) to ISIS in June of 2014 in the Mosul false flag where inexplicably 30,000+ Iraqi troops were told to lay down their weapons and walk away from a couple of hundred ISIS fighters! As improbable as this would be in the real, organic reality, this is precisely what happened in Mosul. Hard evidence would also show that the West planned and operated a training facility in Jordan to train fighters who would immediately join ISIS (like they somehow werent already with ISIS). This CIA training and the facility is fully admitted by the US and the only excuse given was one of plausible deniability where the US says they didnt know these fighters would soon afterward join ISIS. Incidentally, this level of plausible deniability is a common theme in US military operations and psyops which weve seen repeatedly attempted with 9/11 and the entire war on terror dating back to the partnership the US had with the Mujahideen, the Saudis and Bin Laden (aka CIA asset Tim Osmond) himself, so no one should fall for this historic failed tactic. Even recently the alternative media has been reporting huge caches of terrorist held US-made weapons discovered in Aleppo left by the Al Nusra-ISIS US proxy army. The undeniable evidence of this weapons-supplying operation continues to pour out for years. Are you beginning to see the picture and how creating and arming ISIS was the plan from the beginning? This video below is 100% proof and tells the story of how ISIS had been receiving not only guns but truckloads of daily supplies entering through the northern border of Syria from Turkey without a peep of resistance from the Turkish government. Turkey is on record as a key player and co-conspirator in the material support of the ISIS terrorists. With ISIS now fully armed, fed and supplied with everything they need, the actual ISIS psyop on the American people (and the rest of the world) was now ready for a full launch. Suddenly we were told ISIS is everywhere. Suddenly we were shown (albeit staged green-screen videos) how ISIS was beheading Christians. By the fall of 2014 the ISIS psyop was fully operational. The image below shows how in the period just prior to the ISIS show going full speed ahead, the American public was already being played with a subliminal ISIS is here sign in the background of a rally at Ferguson, Missouri for the Michael Brown murder. Was this a subliminal psyop campaign on America? By late 2014 and early 2015 ISIS worship and mass glorification of the group had begun. The message? ISIS is coming and you better get ready! We have now witnessed the greatest marketing campaign known to mankind over the past 2+ years (2014-2016) as ISIS has been blown up to be greater than all the Allied forces of WW1 and WW2 combined. As Ive repeatedly written about, the ISIS global marketing campaign has been over-the-top and surreal in ways the average human cannot even comprehend. If you do your own research youll find there is truly nothing ISIS cannot do. In this 2016 presidential election year weve witnessed ISIS dying out as they are defeated in Syria and Iraq thanks to the effort of the Russian air strikes, the Syrian and Iraqi Army and the Kurds which can be trusted with this mission. ISIS supply lines have been reportedly drying up and with Turkey recently warming up to Russia following the suspected Gulan-led failed coup attempt only time will tell what impact this will have on the always developing ISIS story. As ISIS clearly sustains real losses in the real world, at the same time weve watched the Western mainstream media repeatedly pull out the ISIS card with every other domestic and international staged and false flag shooting event (Charlie Hebdo, Paris attacks, Nice France, Brussels, San Bernardino, Orlando, etc.). Here are two recent stories (here and here) just in the past couple of days where there seems to be no proven connection to ISIS in these isolated events yet were told that ISIS is taking credit for the shootings or they are ISIS inspired. These are all buzzwords they are using in an attempt to keep ISIS alive in your mind because they know that in the real world ISIS is being dismantled and is essentially dying out. That makes sense since you cannot live, let alone fight in an army, without supplies like food and water. Weapons, ammunition and fighting gear does not grow on trees. This is why its so important to absolutely expose the West in their central role of creating, arming, supplying and training ISIS. None of these things happen overnight so lets do what we can to grind out this battle to expose the true creators of ISIS regardless of how many simultaneous psyops they attempt. Ask yourself, is ISIS part of a greater paradigm shift that began years ago? There is so much to this question that everyone should seriously consider. The most important thing to understand about ISIS is that ISIS is a concept. It is a method of control, which in the case of ISIS was planned, created, funded, armed and train (literally at a secret CIA-run base in Jordan) by the West and its supporting allies. Its also important to understand that ISIS is just a name. Dont be fooled by the names. They can and do change their names (individuals and groups) all the time. The name changes only benefit those behind these proxy armies by creating confusion and making it more difficult for researchers or anyone who wants to take advantage of the information flow in 2016 to figure out whats really going on. Realize that if necessary they will create a new group, rename the old group and tell you some incredible story to fit the desired narrative that most people will believe. They will create new problems like this recent mainstream media article suggests and do whatever it takes to achieve their end goals. Will the ruling elite continue to play the ISIS card for very long? And if so, we should all be asking, where is this ultimately going? Indications are that they may be moving in a new direction but there is no telling what this new direction is. This is why over the past year or so weve heard the introduction of new terms like the need to combat ISIS ideology or (as mentioned earlier) labeling attacks and events ISIS inspired. As Ive said many times, for long the West has been working on a campaign to make ISIS seem super mobile and versatile with the ability to magically and elusively appear anywhere in the world in lightning speed even when ISIS is nowhere to be found. The fact of the matter is that ISIS, as we saw with al Qaeda, the Mujahideen and similar terror groups in the 1980s, are concepts created by the Intelligence community as perfect weapons to achieve their new world order plans. In the real, organic and three-dimensional world ISIS appears to be on their last leg as they sustain defeat in multiple Iraqi and Syrian positions. In the two-dimensional engineered world of mainstream media, however, look for ISIS to remain strong and dangerous as always. The mainstream media is already working on ridiculous narratives that suggest if ISIS is defeated they will somehow be stronger and even more dangerous which means MORE terrorism and this is another indicator that they need to create an environment where ISIS is forever. If they finally decide this strategy will not fly then brace yourself for the next psyop which could be even worse and ultimately this is one of the most important points of this article. Think of ISIS as the current bogeyman option and be careful what you ask for. This is why the importance of finally confronting the question of who created ISIS cannot be overemphasized. Without confronting this simple question and answering it properly we will continue to be surrounded by engineered chaos and fear whether it comes at the hands of ISIS or the next bogeyman psyop. And with every day that goes by, the ruling elite will resort to the ISIS card to keep you in fear by retroactively attributing shooting events to ISIS. This will then allow them to beef up the police state, put regions into a state of emergency, lockdown or whatever else they can think of. The consequences of not confronting the truth behind ISIS is now a very dangerous option. Realize once and for all that the entire concept of ISIS terrorism or any future new terrorism groups is a direct road to ushering in their new world order. The ruling elite know they cannot get their new world order in a peaceful planet and without chaos and engineered terrorism. ISIS is now revealed as the most powerful tool that will make it possible for the ruling elite to have their global order (out of chaos). Realize that the plan is set in full motion and they are going to do whatever it takes to get the plan done. So lets not only share with others that the US and its allies created, trained and armed ISIS as a deliberate plan to help accomplish their strategic goals in the Middle East, globally and here in America, but lets also envision ahead of time what new psyops and strategies they will roll out on us to keep the same plans going. The information bottleneck truly is broken and anyone still attributing ISIS to coincident and bad luck is willfully ignoring the truth and avoiding having to face the reality about ISIS. They are refusing to see what even former al Qaeda commanders are telling them. Those still believing government Western mainstream media propaganda are guilty of contributing to the destruction of this nation and the global psychological terrorism weve all been subjected to since 9/11 and especially now for the past two and a half years. Finally, consider that the ISIS issue is a humanity issue and its time for all of humanity to come together and acknowledge this reality. This is arguably THE most important topic humanity faces today and if dealt with and solved it carries the potential to heal humanity across the board in ways we cannot even imagine.

I thought the no-name potus called these Islamic extremists, JV. I think thats why Mika Brzezinski has been getting so upset lately, she knows her daddy could be going to jail along with many propaganda spewing talking heads in the MSM. All their plans and lies are unraveling and when America finds out theyve been lied to about all these wars in the Middle East, not to mention the numerous staged shooting psyops they are all going to jail. They have been waging psychological warfare and psychological terrorism on their own citizens they can call it nudging or even propaganda but somehow I dont think that is going to fly with the America People. Who was it that said, You can lie to some of the people some of the time, but you cant lie to all of the people all of the time. The American public founded Isis, of course encouraged by the representatives they elected. Nonetheless, responsibility lies with the American public, and their easily manipulated prejudices. Its not about West vs East or West vs Islam! Its about ,how the ZioNazi/ISra*l are in almost absolute control of the West and soon enough, globally.

"In honor of Tuesdayâ€™s National Voter Registration day in the US, distribution company Fox Searchlight has launched an in-theater registration initiative tied to Nate Parkerâ€™s slavery drama The Birth of a Nation.    Related: Nate Parker: director with a back story | Observer profile   Beginning with early promotional screenings on 27 September, filmgoers will also be able to register to vote at participating cinemas during The Birth of Nationâ€™s opening weekend between 7-9 October.  Fox Searchlight said in a statement that â€œthe objective for the initiative is to encourage everyone to be a part of US history by highlighting everyoneâ€™s right to vote, encouraging registration and underscoring that their voices and opinions matterâ€. â€œThis presidential election will be especially challenging, as many current laws lack the protection of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,â€ continues the statement. â€œThe act was passed to overcome many legal barriers that individuals faced when exercising their right to vote but section four was ruled unconstitutional by the US supreme court in 2013.â€ The campaign is supported by a PSA with much of the filmâ€™s cast, including Colman Domingo, Aunjanue Ellis, Aja Naomi King and Gabrielle Union. Says Union in the clip: â€œYou matter. Your voice matters. Your vote matters.â€    Parker, who has been embroiled in controversy regarding a 17-year-old rape allegation months following his filmâ€™s rapturous reception at the Sundance film festival, also makes an appearance, saying: â€œNo one has the right to prevent you from participating in what makes Americaâ€™s democracy so great: the right to vote.â€  The Birth of Nation, which sold to Fox Searchlight at Sundance for a record $17.5m, centers on Nat Turner, a former slave who led a violent revolt in 1831 to free slaves in Virginia.",1
"MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” Donald J. Trump was seven minutes into an address on Thursday on the loading dock of a shuttered lighting plant here in New Hampshire, reading from prepared remarks, when he turned his attention to Mexico. That countryâ€™s leaders are smarter than those in the United States, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said.Then, as the sound of a plane overhead drowned out his voice, Mr. Trump went off his script.â€œIn fact,â€ Mr. Trump said, pointing his finger toward the sky, â€œthat could be a Mexican plane up there. Theyâ€™re getting ready to attack.â€The comment was reminiscent of the shoot-from-the-lip style that was a hallmark of his insurgent primary campaign, rather than the more scripted and disciplined approach he has sought to take in recent weeks after a series of remarks entangled him in controversy as he began his general election bid.But as Mr. Trump moves to be more of the conventional candidate that many Republicans hope he will be, there is a concern among many in the party that no matter how much Mr. Trumpâ€™s aides try to harness his message, there are limits to how much he will adjust.The appearance on Thursday was the type Mr. Trump largely avoided during the New Hampshire primary campaign â€” a small event, about 150 people, focused on a specific issue, with questions from the audience. The setting was the old Osram Sylvania lighting manufacturing plant in Manchester, and the topic was trade, an issue on which Mr. Trump has been consistent over many years, denouncing an imbalance with countries like China and Japan.The event was hastily thrown together after a major speech that Mr. Trump gave on the issue had been overshadowed by the  terrorist attack at Istanbulâ€™s main airport. The campaign could not get permission to use the plant itself, which was gutted after closing in 2014, so Mr. Trump spoke outdoors, in the blazing sun, with temperatures climbing toward 90 degrees.Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who had championed a â€œlet Trump be Trumpâ€ approach and whom Mr. Trump fired less than two weeks ago, showed up at the speech, startling reporters. It wasnâ€™t clear whether Mr. Lewandowski, a New Hampshire resident, had met with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump praised himself for holding an event attended by people he described as â€œtotally unvetted.â€ Then he made a word association: â€œAnd speaking of unvetted, weâ€™re going to take care of our vets.â€New Hampshire and Maine, both overwhelmingly white, are places where Mr. Trump is focusing his time. New Hampshire, in particular, is a favorite â€” the state that handed him a comeback win in February after a loss in the Iowa caucuses. Since Mr. Lewandowskiâ€™s departure, Mr. Trump has tried to make a sustained case to anti-trade voters who backed him as well as Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race, tossing aside decades of Republican deference to trade agreements and the business community.Throughout the event on Thursday, Mr. Trump tossed off a list of numbers and facts about the manufacturing losses in New Hampshire, another departure from his approach when Mr. Lewandowski managed the campaign.Mr. Trump seemed mostly at ease with the new stage of his campaign. He put the blame for the budget deficit squarely on Bill and Hillary Clinton, faulting the North American Free Trade Act of 1994 for jobs leaving the country.â€œItâ€™s incredible, when you take a look at the devastation that took place in New York and Pennsylvania and Connecticut,â€ Mr. Trump said, â€œdevastation caused mostly by Nafta.â€But a spokesman for Osram Sylvania told The Associated Press that the plant closing was unrelated to Nafta or any other trade deals.Mr. Trump also predicted an uptick in the price of goods with more limited trade, but suggested that was a compromise for keeping jobs.Many in the crowd were wilting in their gray plastic folding chairs by the time he turned to questions. One man, Warren Goddard of Portsmouth, asked two â€” one pressing Mr. Trump on abortion, which Mr. Goddard called â€œmurder,â€ and another that diminished Israel.â€œWe are going to protect Israel 100 percent,â€ Mr. Trump replied, calling that question â€œnasty.â€ He declined to use the word â€œabortion,â€ saying only, â€œAs to No. 1, we all â€” weâ€™re with you.â€Mr. Trump, whose aides have tried to prod him toward a clarification of his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants, told a woman who asked about using veterans to replace ethnic Transportation Security Administration workers wearing â€œheebeejabbies,â€ an apparent reference to Muslim womenâ€™s scarves, that he was â€œlooking at that. Weâ€™re looking at a lot of things.â€And as he wrapped up, the candidate offered a reminder of how challenging he can be for his handlers. Shoving aside the notes he had been using, Mr. Trump said: â€œI donâ€™t really need those notes, because I donâ€™t need notes. Arenâ€™t I lucky?â€â€œNice to have that ability, isnâ€™t it?â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a good ability to have.â€",1
"Emails Between Hillary And Obama Reveal They Were BOTH Involved In Benghazi Scandal It has been known that Hillary is guilty in the terrible incident in Benghazi, Libya. She is responsible for the lives of four Americans. Recent investigations indicate that Obama might have played a huge role in this along with Hillary. Emails are being investigated by the two. However, when investigators tried to see emails surrounding the event of September 11, 2012, Obama went into action. He completely refused to show these specific emails. His reasoning? There is a precedent of Presidents keeping emails secret if they choose to do so. He is essentially admitting guilt by not releasing these emails that seem to point to his involvement.

Sanctions against Russia will blowback against the EU in ways that the technocrats in Brussels and the fools in Washington DC are unable to envision. The Washington Post states in the article, As talk of sanctions on Russia heats up, business groups draw cautionary line: However, even this notion tragically lacks a sense of much needed economic consistency for any meaningful rebound in economic prosperity. The Wall Street Journal article, Ukraine Tensions Hit Global Companies, illustrates this concern with several examples. Now consider the Trade Picture between the EU and Russia. The economic stakes are very high and all factions will be major losers in a reciprocating sanction trade war. Transnational corporations reflect the following sentiment. We in the business community do not want to be caught in the crossfire, said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce. Corporatocracy opposition to a deliberate sacrifice strategy invented by geopolitical theorists may well be the best move for stopping this lame attempt to gain a questionable tactical or positional compensation in some other form. This chess game has no winner among nations. A loss of economic commerce only helps the vile Soros maneuvers that seek to destroy productive business.

"Nobody has seen Matt LeBlancâ€™s new CBS sitcom Man with a Plan yet, but if its extended first-look trailer is any indication, itâ€™s going to be about as funny as a head-first tumble into a truckload of vomit. It looks flat and broad and desolate, and it looks set to join any number of other failed post-Friends projects for LeBlanc.   Related: Joey from Friends becomes first TV character to be 'virtually immortalized'   In fact, while weâ€™re here, letâ€™s rank all 13 TV shows that starred a former Friends star, from worst to best. 13 â€“ Joey (Matt LeBlanc, 2004-2006)     A sitcom so catastrophic that it stopped LeBlanc from acting for half a decade. Joeyâ€™s premise was so lousy â€“ Joey from Friends detaches himself from his New York support system in order to flounder miserably in LA â€“ that you can barely believe it was even made. A failure in every respect. 12 â€“ Dirt (Courteney Cox, 2007-2008)     When Friends ended, Courteney Cox decided to go dark. Dirt was a torrid drama about a celebrity tabloid magazine. There were stabbings. There was suicide. There was schizophrenia and depression and overdoses and car crashes and death and, notoriously, quite a lot of masturbation. As tawdry and miserable as the culture it intended to skewer. 11 â€“ Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (Matthew Perry, 2006-2007)     A show that tackled the same meaty issues as The West Wing, even though it was about comedy writers telling fart jokes in a room. To be fair, Matthew Perry was pretty great in this, but the whole thing was let down by the one character who kept looking offscreen and quivering whenever anyone mentioned Iraq. 10 â€“ Feed the Beast (David Schwimmer, 2016)     The antihero drama genre has become so threadbare of late that new angles are hard to come by. Feed the Beast â€“ where David Schwimmer plays an alcoholic sommelier widower trying to open a Greek restaurant despite being embroiled in a feud with the mob â€“ was certainly a new angle. It was also a terrible one, and the show ended after one season. 9 â€“ The Odd Couple (Matthew Perry, 2015-)     The Odd Couple is one of the oldest and least inspired ideas in comedy. And yet it seems to have given Matthew Perry his most successful post-Friends show to date. This might be down to the quality of his partnership with Thomas Lennon, but it could equally be down to Perryâ€™s realization that people donâ€™t really want to see him do anything interesting or new. 8 â€“ Top Gear (Matt LeBlanc, 2016-)     Maybe next yearâ€™s series, when Matt LeBlanc will get to pilot the ship without the shrill sub-Clarksonisms of Chris Evans, will be better than this yearâ€™s runny poo of a turnout. However, you still canâ€™t escape the sensation that Top Gear will remain a shadow of its former self until someone does the decent thing and puts it out of its misery. 7 â€“ Episodes (Matt LeBlanc, 2011-)     Episodes is apparently still being made, which will be news to everyone who drifted away from the show after a couple of years. Matt LeBlanc plays himself in a comedy about two British people hired to remake their sitcom for an American audience, and itâ€™s OK in places if you like that sort of thing. 6 â€“ Go On (Matthew Perry, 2012-2013)     An incredibly little-watched, barely remembered orphan of a show where Matthew Perry played a recent widower forced into a bereavement support group. By no means a success â€“ it suffered from an ungoogleable name and a fixation on becoming the next Community â€“ Go On still managed to be charming and diverting when it put the effort in. 5 â€“ Web Therapy (Lisa Kudrow, 2011-2015)     Rightly overshadowed by her other post-Friends show, Web Therapy just about escapes the orbit of its gimmicky premise thanks to Lisa Kudrowâ€™s monstrous therapist and the unstoppable procession of guest stars. This is the only show on this list to feature Meryl Streep, for instance. 4 â€“ Cougar Town (Courteney Cox, 2009-2015)     Despite its horrible pilot â€“ where Courteney Cox decides to start shagging teenage boys â€“ Cougar Town relaxed substantially over the course of its run, until it simply became a show about people hanging out and getting drunk. Undemanding but, when it tried, inspired. 3 â€“ Mr Sunshine (Matthew Perry, 2011)     Mr Sunshine, created by Matthew Perry himself, was basically â€œChandler Bing does The Brittas Empireâ€. However, despite that, it was sparky and silly and should have run for several years. The fact it didnâ€™t was a crying shame. It also had one of the worldâ€™s greatest-ever theme tunes. 2 â€“ The People vs OJ Simpson (David Schwimmer, 2016)    As great as The People vs OJ Simpson was, it also acted as a rehabilitation zone for out-of-favour actors. John Travolta and Cuba Gooding Jr both benefited greatly from their inclusion, but David Schwimmer â€“ playing a Kardashian, no less â€“ also proved himself to be surprisingly capable. 1 â€“ The Comeback (Lisa Kudrow, 2005-)     Not just the best post-Friends show, but one of the best shows of this century. The Comeback is destined to stand forever as Lisa Kudrowâ€™s defining work. Every element found in the rest of this list â€“ broad comedy, dark tinges, lacerating examinations of fame â€“ can be found in this reality TV spoof. Itâ€™s painful and heartbreaking and funny, and it deserves to be watched over and over again. Brilliant.",1
"See What These States Are Doing To Ensure That Illegals Arent Housed There The border crisis has reached a disastrous level, and without government action, Americans and state governments are starting to suspect that the administration has a very specific goal: to force amnesty as the only option. With thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the border in the past few months, and the government shipping them to states around the country instead of deporting them, its hard to imagine that the administration has the American peoples interest at heart at all. State governments have had to take it upon themselves to protect their local communities, but the economic burden of caring for the new bodies is not an easy one to bear. In fact, several states are deciding to push back on the government, and refuse the housing of any illegal immigrants in the state. Massachusetts is the most recent state to be vocal about the issue. According to My Fox Boston, Governor Deval Patrick has decided that housing units are no longer needed. Many suspect that his statements are due to pressure from local government officials, who understood that the federal government had very little chance of reimbursing the bill. State Representative Randy Hunt claimed that shipping illegal immigrants across the country and housing them was a terrible use of tax dollars. It appears that vocal opposition from local governments may be exactly what we need to push the administration to actionbefore they do the same to the American people. ",0
"According to sources huddled by the window, there are currently, like, six or seven cop cars parked right outside that building across the street over there.

"While standing in front of his open closet, Ken Ciszek announced Tuesday that he is instituting a T-shirt purchasing freeze until further notice. Cisnek and some of his favorite T-shirts. 'Although I love and have always loved T-shirts, the time has come to halt their acquisition,' Ciszek said. 'This includes T-shirts that feature bands and movies I like, locations I have visited, sports teams I support, causes I endorse, and phrases I find funny.' Ciszek said he has been buying T-shirts since high school. 'When I was a kid, I'd pick one up at every concert,' Ciszek said. 'Then, in college, I started buying them from thrift stores or getting them at political rallies.' The 29-year-old restaurant manager instituted his T-shirt-buying freeze when he realized he had so many T-shirts that he had lost track of his holdings. 'I found a great Cheap Trick Dream Police tour shirt at a garage sale,' Ciszek said. 'I couldn't believe my luck, but then I got home and realized I had one exactly like it buried under my other band T-shirts. Until I can figure out what to do with these things, I'm cutting myself off. It'll be hard, but I gotta do it.' Ciszek keeps the T-shirts that he wears most frequently hung in his closet. His second-tier T-shirts are kept folded on top of his dresser, which is filled with third- and fourth-tier T-shirts. Ciszek also has a box of T-shirts under his bed. 'There are ones I haven't worn in, like, four years,' Ciszek said. 'Some of them are riddled with holes. Some are so old that they're practically translucent. I have a 'Don't Mess With Texas' T-shirt that's so faded, the logo isn't even there anymore. It's just an outline of the state.' Added Ciszek: 'But I love it, and I just can't bring myself to throw it out, until it falls completely apart or is ripped from my back.' Ciszek first recognized his problem in August, when his washing machine broke and he was able to go six weeks without needing to wash a T-shirt. Though he could easily donate his less-favored shirts to charity or throw them away, Ciszek said he is at a loss. 'Which ones can I get rid of?' said Ciszek, standing over a pile of shirts on his bed. 'I mean, they all have sentimental value. This Old Milwaukee shirt I got to cheer myself up after I broke my leg in 2000. Here's one from a Fun Run I got roped into doing once. This one has a fish on itI got it at a gas station. This one says 'We're All Earnest.' I have no idea what that even means, but the old telephone on it looks really cool.' Ciszek received some of the T-shirts in his wardrobe as gifts. 'This one is from the camp that my friend Jake worked at over the summer,' Ciszek said. 'My sister bought me this one at Disney WorldI don't even like it, really, but I keep it because it was nice that she thought of me. Oh, wow. There's still a price tag on it.' At last count, Ciszek said he owned 132 T-shirts. The glut has gotten so out of control that he has been forced to turn down free T-shirts. 'I was at a sneak preview for Kill Bill, and they were tossing free stuff into the audience,' Ciszek said. 'Just my luck, instead of a hat or a poster or something, a T-shirt landed right on my head. I gave it to the guy sitting next to me. That's something I never would have done a year ago.' Ciszek's girlfriend, Faye Bullington, called the T-shirt purchase freeze 'a step in the right direction.' 'If only I could just get him to start wearing shirts with buttons,' Bullington said. 'He's almost 30, but he still dresses like a 16-year-old. Is it really necessary for him to alert everyone on the street that he's been to San Diego?' ",0
"During his speech Wednesday evening at the Democratic National Convention in downtown Charlotte, former U.S. president Bill Clinton finally just unzipped his fly and showed the entire country his penis. Sources at the convention told reporters that shortly after stepping onstage at the Time Warner Cable Arena, the 42nd president of the United States quieted the audiences extended standing ovation with his raised hands and began to speak loudly and confidently. My fellow Americans, for the past 20 years you have all, at various points, talked and thought about my penis, or at least heard direct or indirect references to my penis in news reports, in court records, or in the culture at large, the former commander in chief said. My penis has, in a sense, been a central part of American life for the better part of two decades. And yet, the nation has never seen it. Tonight, Id like to finally change that. So should we just get this over with then? the president asked the 20,000-member audience, as well as millions watching the nationwide telecast. Should I show you my penis? Immediately after Clinton asked this question, there was reportedly a brief pause, after which a few murmured consents of approval were audible in the crowd, as well as a number of voices clearly shouting okay and sure. Sources said the sounds of convention attendees shifting in their seats could then be heard as the president stepped forward to the end of the stage. Okay, Im going to show you my penis now, said the former president, his hand reaching for his pants zipper as a dead quiet fell over the arena. Wow. You know, its funny, now that its finally happening, I actually feel a little nervous. I think its good that Im doing it, but still Okay, here goes. Clinton then slowly unzipped his fly, gingerly reached inside his pants, and retrieved his flaccid penis, which he proceeded to let hang out in the open in clear view. Theres my penis, the nations former chief executive said on live television. There he is. Im just going to leave it out for a while so everybody can get a good look, added Clinton, turning his waist from side to side in order to give everyone in the audience an optimal view. Can everyone in the back see okay? Make sure the cameras here in the front can get a good close-up of my penis. After a full five minutes of standing silently with his penis in full view as cameras flashed all around him, the president carefully tucked his penis back into his pants, zipped up his fly, smiled, told the audience, Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America, and walked off stage. When reached for comment on the speech, President Obama told reporters, We are glad to have President Clintons support. ",0
"Jamie Daniels, juror #7 in The State Of Ohio vs. Greg Mitchell, was 'on the edge of the seat' after closing arguments in the double-murder trial Monday, saying she could not wait to see how it turned out, though she also wished the three-week-long 'roller-coaster ride' could go on forever. 'The prosecutor was just so intense and animated, and when he demanded that the jury show the accused killer no more mercy than he showed those young girls, I swear, he was looking right at me,' said Daniels, who added that the defense attorney's disarming cross-examination of an important but unstable witness was just the kind of 'riveting performance' she was hoping for. 'Every day I know by the way the defendant glances at me that he is wondering if I, specifically, am on his side. And I love that.' Heading in to deliberations, Daniels said she was not certain that Mitchell deserved the most severe punishment in the land, but admitted that a capital sentence had the most potential for multiple juicy appeals.

JosÃ© Mourinho can expect no more than a one game touchline ban should he accept any charge for being sent to the stands during Manchester Unitedâ€™s 0-0 draw with Burnley on Saturday at Old Trafford.   Related: JosÃ© Mourinho behaving at Manchester United exactly as critics said he would | Paul Wilson   The manager was unhappy with the failure of Mark Clattenburg to award a penalty after Matteo Darmian went down in the Burnley area just before half-time. Mourinho approached the referee during the interval and was sent from the touchline for whatever he said to the official. Mourinho will find out either on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning if he is to be charged once the Football Association receives the report of the incident. His record is not relevant because his last offence falls outside the 12-month window the FA takes into account. If charged and found guilty Mourinho could be fined and warned as to his future conduct and so escape a touchline ban. Mourinhoâ€™s words are thought to have been abusive towards Clattenburg and it is likely he will receive a ban. This will be a single match if he accepts the charge or two games if he does not and is found guilty. Mourinho has until 6pm on Monday to answer a separate charge of misconduct regarding comments made about Anthony Taylor before the referee officiating Unitedâ€™s 0-0 draw at Liverpool on 17 October.,1
"If the National Financial Stabilization Fund withdraws from the stock market, it will not have a major impact on Taiwan's stock exchange, Civil Service Minister Chang Che-shen said Friday. Chang noted that the aim of the fund is to stabilize the nation's financial markets, and that if the nation's economy is in a slump and the stock market plunges, then the fund will enter the market to restore investor confidence. 'But if it has achieved the end, then there will definitely be a withdrawal mechanism,' Chang added. 'Considering that current transaction volume is close to NT$200 billion daily, the fund's withdrawal should not have too much of an impact on the stock market,' he said. Chang made the remarks during a seminar on the management of the government pension fund and its relationship to sound development of Taiwan's capital markets. The seminar was sponsored by the Ministry of Civil Service. Examination Yuan President John Kuan said at the seminar that as of the end of 2009, the scale of the pension fund has reached NT$450 billion. Chang, who serves concurrently as the chairman of civil service pension fund management committee, said the fund earned NT$75.4 billion in 2009. The fund's performance last year made up for loses incurred in the previous year. The fund recorded its highest annual yield since it was established in 1995. Meanwhile, Yu Reming, a Prudential executive, said Friday that if the fund pulls out of the stock market, it will have a psychological effect but not a big substantive impact. The National Financial Stabilization Fund had held a meeting earlier in which it was decided that the fund could duly buy and sell Taiwan stocks starting Friday, which was generally seen as an indication the fund is preparing to sell shares to cash in on profits.

"Standing next to a thin belt of rattling trees that represents the only line of green in vast stretches of orange desert, 70-year-old Hamud El-Nour Hamdallah recalls a time when this area in Sudanâ€™s River Nile state was dense forest. If you had not found Goz El Halg village by nightfall, you would have to wait until morning to find your way out. But decades of drought and deforestation have allowed sand to roll through the desert and swallow homes and farmland. Hamdallah and his community now go to bed not knowing if they will make it out of their homes the next day. â€œItâ€™s especially scary when the house is covered [in sand] at night and you can only wait in the dark until morning to dig your way out,â€ by shovelling through sand or using a tractor to wade through it, he said. The sand can even pour into homes through windows and doors or collapse buildings. â€œWe have been almost buried in sand,â€ said Hamdallah. Research from a Sudanese government climate programme launched a decade ago shows that the boundary between desert and semi-desert has shifted 50-200km southward since the 1930s.    Former villages are now only visible as brick outlines in the sand. Photograph: Mohammed Basheer/HCENR/UNDP   In many villages like Goz El Halg, whose name derives from the encroaching â€˜gezanâ€™, or dunes, the desert has finally engulfed places that used to have so much wood it drew people to live there and spurred a boat-building industry. Hamdallah is one of many elders who have had to move villages three times as the sand took over. A previous village lying a few hundred metres away is now barely visible, with some houses reduced to brick outlines in the sand. The village now serves as a playground for children, who play hide and seek behind steep orange dunes, some of which tower above the height of the houses that once stood there. â€œI donâ€™t like what has happened to the old village,â€ said 14-year-old Ruwaya Ferra, a student at the local school. The children here are taught about the importance of conserving trees and water to stop history from repeating itself. Small gangs of shy girls know all the words to jaunty songs about protecting trees, because they sing them once a week or more at school. Teachers stress the importance of protecting the environment, starting with the plants sheltered in small rockeries in the otherwise barren school yard, and pen poems about shooing goats away from the precious patches of green. â€œDonâ€™t cut a leaf off a tree because we donâ€™t want drought and desert to come to us,â€ said Ferra, repeating one of the mantras drummed into new generations.  Map  But tree-cutting for charcoal and land degradation due to mismanagement are not the only factors at play in Sudan. People here started feeling the effects of global warming in the 1980s, with temperatures of over 50C making summers unbearable and winters uncomfortable, erratic rains ruining harvests and floods or droughts turning arable land into dust or gravel.  Ismail El Gizouli, a Sudanese climate change negotiator and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said:â€œSince the 1970s, we [the world] are moving very fast towards disaster, towards the end of the earth. So this is why we have to move very quickly now [to cut greenhouse gas emissions].â€  In Sudan, decades of conflict, international sanctions against President Omar al-Bashirâ€™s government and the loss of most of the countryâ€™s oil and forests in 2011 with South Sudanâ€™s secession have exacerbated the effects of climate change. â€œThe problem is caused by the big emitters [of greenhouse gases] but we are the first who are affected because our backbone is very weak, our infrastructure very weak,â€ said Gizouli. While developed countries can absorb weather shocks, Sudanâ€™s ability to respond to droughts and floods is as poor as its people, two-thirds of whom are farmers.    Women in a tree nursery, part of a climate change adaptation project in Nile River state. Photograph: Mohammed Basheer/HCENR/UNDP   Currently Africa only attracts 5% of the worldâ€™s climate-related funding, despite suffering disproportionately from the impacts of global warming. â€œThis is why people are attacking the rich countries. They want to live in luxury â€“ let us therefore die,â€ said Gizouli, who is pushing richer countries for money for more projects to adapt to climate change. In Sudan, the Forests National Corporation started reserving areas in the 1980s, and a decade later the Sudan National Adaptation Programme of Action started planting belts of trees to protect fields and homes. Aid from Canada, the UK and the United Nations Development Programme is being spent on rehabilitation and irrigation projects in desert villages. In River Nile state, government officials say that around 8,000 trees have been planted over the past two years and that, as farmersâ€™ crop yields increase, communities are turning to tree nurseries and swapping charcoal for butane gas. But it will take significant investment to scale up climate adaptation projects to stop heat, sandstorms and floods from sweeping away homes and fertile top soils. In Goz El Halg, Hamdallah and other elders come daily to water and bolster another 2.5km-long greenbelt planted five years ago with water from a well powered by a solar-pump that has eased reliance on the rain.    Planting some of over 23,000 tree seedlings along 12km of the edges of the wadi banks to reverse erosion as part of a project by Sudanâ€™s Forests National Corporation. Photograph: UNEP   These trees are the last line of desert defence standing between the burial or survival of a village that has already lost half of its residents to El Damer, the state capital around two hoursâ€™ drive away in a 4x4 through mostly empty desert. But Hamdallah believes that the people that stayed are better off than those who ended up in Sudanâ€™s increasingly overstretched and under-resourced urban areas. â€œIâ€™m delighted about these trees because they protect us,â€ he said, surveying the still-growing trees through a pair of oversized shades as he mulls whether or not he will move again in his lifetime. â€œI donâ€™t think so. They have saved us from the sands, I think.â€",1

"Brazil will generate 1.1 million new jobs in 2009 and about 2 million in 2010, Labor Minister Carlos Lupi said on Thursday. Lupi said that the estimates are the same with that of last year, when the effects of international financial crisis were severe. He said the Brazilian economy has already recovered from the crisis, attributing to anti-crisis measures carried out by the government, and that it would register its best year in 2010. The Labor Ministry's latest National Registry of Employment and Unemployment report said that 934,000 formal jobs were generated in Brazil during the first nine months of 2009, and 232,000 in September. Hirings were expected to increase in the upcoming months, because more temporary jobs would be offered for the upcoming Christmas season, officials said. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics said earlier in the day that the country's current unemployment rate is at 7.7 percent, the lowest in 2009. Lupi also commented on Brazil's workweek, saying that he would be in favor of reducing the workweek to 40 hours, which might lead to more job spots, more social justice and an increase of companies' productivity.

"The loss of their long unbeaten home record in the Premier League all but confirmed that Leicester will have to look to the Champions League for a sensation this season. West Bromwich Albion deservedly became the first visiting team in more than a year to leave the King Power with three Premier League points and, in doing so, they left Leicester just two above the bottom three. It is premature to talk about the champions being embroiled in a fight against relegation but we can certainly say that the chances of them retaining their domestic crown are so remote as to be extra-terrestrial. Last season Leicester conquered thanks to their efficiency, as they were a unit in which every component gelled and excelled to create synergy. But they have spluttered for much of this campaign because of the loss of Nâ€™Golo KantÃ© and, in the league at least, of whatever mental fuel it was that helped drive them to the title. In the last fortnight they had shown signs of rediscovering their fluency but here they relapsed into disjointedness. Albion functioned better from the start and won thanks to a neat clip by Matt Phillips in the 72nd minute after an uncharacteristic mistake from Danny Drinkwater. â€œIâ€™m sorry for the loss of our home record,â€ said Claudio Ranieri. â€œWe were so bad in the first half, we were better in the second but we still lost,â€ he continued before venturing, without conviction, that his team may have been jaded from their midweek draw in Copenhagen. â€œMaybe we had Champions League fatigue, I donâ€™t know.â€   Related: Leicester 1-2 West Brom: Premier League â€“ as it happened   Leicesterâ€™s scruffiness surfaced as early in the second minute, when Andy King was caught dawdling midway inside his own half by SalomÃ³n RondÃ³n, who burst into the box and curled a low shot towards the bottom corner. Ron-Robert Zieler dived to tip it around the post. It was a terrific save but the goalkeeperâ€™s all-round performance in place of the injured Kasper Schmeichel betrayed his unfamiliarity with his team-mates, the Germanâ€™s hesitant distribution one of the hostsâ€™ many problems. Twice he came close to being caught in possession by RondÃ³n, the gameâ€™s outstanding forward. RondÃ³n met a cross by Phillips in the 15th minute. His header missed the target but the fact that he was dominating Wes Morgan and Robert Huth in the air, as well as on the ground, was ominous for Leicester. The hosts, meanwhile, rarely troubled the Albion defence. Ranieri had opted to leave Jamie Vardy on the bench. The England strikerâ€™s scoring touch has deserted him, as he came into this game without a goal in his last 11 matches for his club, and the manager explained that the plan here was for Leicesterâ€™s wingers to play to the strengths of Islam Slimani and Shinji Okazaki instead by providing crosses from wide. But Riyad Mahrez failed to make an impact in the first period and Ahmed Musaâ€™s deliveries were bad enough to suggest that if he were your milkman, you would find broken bottles on your door step every morning. Phillipsâ€™ crosses were better. In the 17th minute he forced Christian Fuchs into an urgent intervention to prevent Chris Brunt from scoring from close range. Ranieri replaced Okazaki with Vardy at half-time and Leicester improved, although those two facts were not necessarily related, as Vardy seldom threatened. And before improving, Leicester fell behind. RondÃ³n was instrumental in the breakthrough, winning the ball in midfield before feeding Phillips, whose cross from the right was guided into the net by a header from James Morrison.   Related: Liverpoolâ€™s Sadio ManÃ© shows Watford no mercy to put JÃ¼rgen Klopp top   That triggered a reaction from Leicester. They drew level three minutes later via a long-distance Algerian one-two. Slimani swept the ball wide to Mahrez and then galumphed into the box to get on the end of his compatriotâ€™s cross and equalise with a splendid header. Now we had a high-calibre contest and the game hurtled from one end to the other. Danny Simpson had to bundle a header off his own line in the 70th minute. But eventually Leicester were undone by another outbreak of sloppiness as Drinkwater unintentionally played a backpass into the path of Phillips, who cantered on to it and lifted the ball over the advancing Zieler. It was a deflating moment for a midfielder who contributed so much to Leicesterâ€™s title triumph and perhaps a critical one for Phillips. â€œHis biggest problem is self-belief,â€ said Tony Pulis. â€œI had a good chat with him last week. Heâ€™s got all the tools and he has to understand that heâ€™s a good player.â€ If doubts ever stalk him again, the Scottish international need only look back to this performance.",1
Why Obama Speech Spells No Change to Global SurveillanceBreaking The Set ,0
"Senate Votes to Ban Bush-Approved Torture TechniquesBy Claire Bernish Designed to give permanence to an executive order issued by President Obama soon after he took office, the ban would limit interrogation and detention techniques to those outlined in the U.S. Army Field Manual. Without the amendments conversion to law, the restrictions could only be guaranteed for as long as a future president agrees to leave them in place, explained Senator Dianne Feinstein, who co-sponsored the bill with Senator John McCain. Feinstein called for support of the measure in order to recommit ourselves to the fundamental precept that the U.S. does not torturewithout exception and without equivocationand ensure that the mistakes of our past are never again repeated in the future. Though the ban is largely viewed as an important step, its basis in guidelines in the Army Field Manual leaves room for improvementsleep deprivation, stress positions, and other cruel and inhuman tortures are condoned. However, the amendment does dictate that the manual be updated every three years so that it reflects current evidence-based best practices for interrogation designed to elicit reliable and voluntary statements that do not involve the use or threat of force. The amendment also requires the Red Cross to be notified of, and have access to, every detaineebringing the U.S. into long overdue accord with the Geneva Convention. In December, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which Feinstein chaired at the time, issued a sobering report describing in harrowing detail the CIAs torture program following 9/11. According to the report, at least 26 people had been wrongfully held by the CIA. McCain, who experienced torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said that past practices had compromised our values, stained our national honor and did little good. He addressed the floor of the Senate prior to the vote, stating, I know from personal experience that abuse of prisoners does not provide good, reliable intelligence. I firmly believe that all people, even captured enemies, are protected by basic human rights. Steve Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, issued a statement following the Senate vote, saying: Claire Bernish writes for theAntiMedia.org, where this article first appeared.

"Critically low on small denominations, the Treasury Department put out an urgent call for ones and fives Monday. An urgent call is put out to citizens on the statue in front of the Treasury Building. 'If we don't get some soon, we're going to run out,' Deputy Treasury Secretary Kenneth Dam said. 'And right now, we have no one we can send to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to grab more. [Executive Secretary] Jeffrey [Kupfer] is in Federal Trade Commission meetings all day, and [Under Secretary] Peter [Fisher] is too new to handle cash.' Though Dam said he suspects there may be a fully stocked tray of cash in the department's safe, the only one who knows the combination is Secretary Paul O'Neill, who is at an economic summit in Stockholm until Saturday. The shortfall, Dam said, is the result of the unusually busy day the department is having. 'For some reason, all the banks want ones and fives today,' Dam said. 'Usually, it's twenties we run low on first, because everybody needs them for their cash machines, but today it's the small stuff.' In addition to a sign on the Alexander Hamilton statue in front of the Treasury Building, Dam posted a handwritten sign on the front door reading, 'We need ones and fives!!! Any that you have would be hugley [sic] appreciated!!!' Thus far, no one has come forward. The appeal was directed at any U.S. citizens in the vicinity of the department, as well as members of Congress, whose annual budget allocation to the Treasury Department is forthcoming. 'We have, like, less than 10 ones left right now,' Dam said. 'We have a few rolls of quarters we could give out four at a time, but those won't last very long.' Early Tuesday morning, Dam put in a call to the Internal Revenue Service to lend the Treasury any singles it may have on hand from early tax returns. 'So far, I haven't heard back from [IRS commissioner] Charles [Rossotti],' Dam said. 'I left a message, but he must be real busy this time of year. Hopefully soon.' Dam, who was left in charge of the Treasury in O'Neill's absence, was explicitly told by the secretary to make sure the department kept plenty of small bills on hand. 'This is really getting bad,' Dam said. 'All we need is for one more lending institution to come in here and ask us to break a twenty and that's it.' ",0

"No interior de um aviÃ£o monomotor, cuja fuselagem reproduz as manchas das onÃ§as-pintadas, Ã‚ngelo Rabelo verifica alguns dados num pequeno laptop. â€œEstamos nos aproximando de uma nascente!â€ diz ele, aos gritos, a fim de vencer o barulhento propulsor da aeronave. LÃ¡ embaixo, num trecho em que banha o estado do Mato Grosso, o rio Paraguai serpenteia por entre Ã¡reas de mata e grandes extensÃµes de terra ocupadas por propriedades agrÃ­colas. O aviÃ£o sobrevoa uma imensidÃ£o descampada, destinada ao cultivo da soja, onde predominam os tons marrom-claros e o aspecto Ã¡rido. Uma estreita faixa de Ã¡rvores separa a lavoura do curso dâ€™Ã¡gua, em que jaz uma nascente pulsante. Rabelo Ã© presidente da ONG Instituto Homem Pantaneiro, que luta pela preservaÃ§Ã£o da regiÃ£o pantaneira, monitorando rios e estimulando a populaÃ§Ã£o local a adotar prÃ¡ticas sustentÃ¡veis. O rio Paraguai â€œfunciona como a principal artÃ©ria, irrigando as veias do corpo do Pantanalâ€“ se essa artÃ©ria for obstruÃ­da, o corpo inteiro entra em colapso,â€ diz ele. O Pantanal Ã© a maior Ã¡rea alagÃ¡vel do mundo. Apesar de estar concentrado no Brasil, o bioma tambÃ©m avanÃ§a BolÃ­via e Paraguai adentro, espalhando-se por um total de 170,500 quilÃ´metros quadrados â€“ extensÃ£o equivalente Ã  soma dos territÃ³rios de BÃ©lgica, Holanda, Portugal e SuÃ­Ã§a. Na regiÃ£o, hÃ¡ 4,7 mil espÃ©cies de plantas e animais selvagens, algumas das quais ameaÃ§adas de extinÃ§Ã£o, como a onÃ§a-pintada, o tamanduÃ¡-bandeira, o tatu-canastra e a arara-azul-grande. Milhares dos habitantes da regiÃ£o vivem da terra, dedicando-se Ã  pesca ou Ã  agricultura familiar.    No Pantanal, hÃ¡ vÃ¡rias espÃ©cies em extinÃ§Ã£o, incluindo a arara-azul-grande. Photograph: Joel Sartore/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative   Acontece que os rios do Pantanal â€“ que sÃ£o fundamentais para todas as formas de vida do biomaâ€“ estÃ£o sendo ameaÃ§ados pelo desmatamento, assim como pela erosÃ£o que a expansÃ£o da agricultura industrial e a execuÃ§Ã£o de obras de infraestrutura vÃªm causando.   Fico encantado com a beleza natural e o incessante processo de renovaÃ§Ã£o das Ã¡guas.  Angelo Rabelo    Preservar essa regiÃ£o Ãºnica Ã© uma tarefa hercÃºlea, que exige aÃ§Ãµes em inÃºmeras frentes, mas ativistas e ONGs brasileiras e internacionais encaram o desafio. Alguns sÃ£o pantaneiros de nascimento, outros por vocaÃ§Ã£o. E, nÃ£o importando se estÃ£o envolvidos em atividades de fiscalizaÃ§Ã£o e preservaÃ§Ã£o dos rios que formam essa planÃ­cie aluvial, ou no monitoramento de espÃ©cies ameaÃ§adas, ou na luta pela aprovaÃ§Ã£o de leis de proteÃ§Ã£o ambiental melhores e mais restritivas, todos tÃªm em comum a paixÃ£o pelo Pantanal. â€œAinda hoje eu me sinto como da primeira vez em que estive aqui,â€ diz Rabelo, que Ã© tenente-coronel reformado da polÃ­cia florestal. â€œFico encantado com a beleza natural e o incessante processo de renovaÃ§Ã£o das Ã¡guas.â€ A enxurrada dos â€˜fazendeiros do asfaltoâ€™    A atividade agrÃ­cola, concentrada na pecuÃ¡ria de corte e na soja, dois dos principais itens da pauta de exportaÃ§Ãµes do Brasil, experimentou forte recuperaÃ§Ã£o no Pantanal. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   A agricultura extensiva chegou ao Pantanal na dÃ©cada de 1960, quando o Brasil vivia sob o regime militar. Depois da grande cheia de 1974, muitos agricultores se viram Ã  beira da falÃªncia e o preÃ§o da terra despencou. De lÃ¡ para cÃ¡, principalmente em decorrÃªncia do crescimento econÃ´mico dos anos 2000, a atividade agrÃ­cola da regiÃ£o â€“ que se concentra na pecuÃ¡ria e na soja, dois dos principais itens da pauta exportadora do paÃ­s â€“ experimentou forte recuperaÃ§Ã£o. Nos Ãºltimos cinco anos, em particular, o Pantanal atraiu grande nÃºmero de agricultores provenientes de outras partes do Brasil. Ficaram conhecidos como â€œfazendeiros do asfaltoâ€, pois, diferentemente dos agricultores tradicionais da regiÃ£o, preferem se instalar em zonas urbanas, em vez de viver em suas propriedades.   Produtos quÃ­micos proibidos no Brasil podem estar sendo trazidos da BolÃ­via e do Paraguai por contrabandistas  Dr Catia Nunes da Cunha    â€œEles vÃªm para o Pantanal porque o preÃ§o da terra Ã© baixo,â€ diz Catia Nunes da Cunha, coordenadora do NÃºcleo de Estudos EcolÃ³gicos do Pantanal, da Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso. â€œEm SÃ£o Paulo e no Rio Grande do Sul, onde a infraestrutura Ã© boa, nÃ£o hÃ¡ terra barata. Muitas vezes, como os agricultores pantaneiros estÃ£o passando por dificuldades financeiras, os de fora acabam comprando propriedades por valores abaixo do mercado.â€ A substituiÃ§Ã£o de lavradores locais, que se dedicavam sobretudo Ã  agricultura de subsistÃªncia, por grandes produtores agrÃ­colas, que nÃ£o tÃªm vÃ­nculos pessoais com a regiÃ£o e fazem uso das tÃ©cnicas e mÃ¡quinas tÃ­picas da agricultura extensiva, Ã© frequentemente citada por acadÃªmicos e ONGs como uma das principais ameaÃ§as Ã  preservaÃ§Ã£o do Pantanal. Segundo o WWF Brasil, cerca de 40% da Ã¡rea total da bacia do Alto Paraguai jÃ¡ foi desmatada e 30% das nascentes que alimentam o Pantanal correm risco ecolÃ³gico, demandando aÃ§Ãµes urgentes.    Na regiÃ£o hÃ¡ 4,7 mil espÃ©cies de plantas e animais selvagens. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   Segundo analistas, a expansÃ£o da soja na regiÃ£o Ã© uma tendÃªncia particularmente preocupante, tendo em vista o uso de agrotÃ³xicos que podem contaminar as Ã¡guas da bacia. â€œNÃ£o sabemos a proveniÃªncia desses produtos nem as substÃ¢ncias utilizadas em sua composiÃ§Ã£o. Como estamos numa regiÃ£o de fronteira, produtos quÃ­micos proibidos no Brasil podem estar sendo trazidos da BolÃ­via e do Paraguai por contrabandistas,â€ diz Cunha. Para piorar as coisas, as autoridades de fiscalizaÃ§Ã£o padecem de grave falta de recursos. Na cidade de CÃ¡ceres, o capitÃ£o Thiago Martins de Souza, da polÃ­cia militar ambiental local, diz que seu batalhÃ£o dispÃµe de apenas 25 policiais para atender 22 municipalidades e de uma Ãºnica caminhonete 4x4 em condiÃ§Ãµes razoÃ¡veis de funcionamento. O Instituto Homem Pantaneiro desenvolve um projeto chamado Cabeceiras do Pantanal, em que sÃ£o monitoradas quase 1,000 Ã¡reas de nascentes e de lavoura nas proximidades das margens de rios. Os dados sÃ£o enviados para o departamento de pesquisa que a Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul tem em seu campus do Pantanal, onde sÃ£o analisados. Caso sejam identificadas irregularidades, como a presenÃ§a de Ã¡reas de plantio excessivamente prÃ³ximas da margem do rio, podendo causar erosÃ£o e assoreamento e interferindo na dinÃ¢mica fluvial, a polÃ­cia ambiental Ã© informada e o agricultor fica sujeito Ã  aplicaÃ§Ã£o de multas pesadas. A infraestrutura entrava o meio ambiente    â€˜O rio Paraguai parece uma cobra, Ã© cheio de curvas e reentrÃ¢ncias; e eles querem instalar a hidrovia numa linha reta. VocÃª faz ideia do impacto que isso teria?â€™ Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   O uso crescente de usinas hidrelÃ©tricas para gerar energia na regiÃ£o Ã© outra grande ameaÃ§a. â€œAo instalar vÃ¡rias barragens hidrelÃ©tricas ao longo do curso de um rio, vocÃª cria uma sÃ©rie de entraves ao meio ambiente,â€ diz JÃºlio CÃ©sar Sampaio da Silva, coordenador do programa Cerrado-Pantanal do WWF Brasil. O uso excessivo de barragens altera o regime anual de cheias e secas do Pantanal, explica ele. A bacia do Alto Paraguai conta atualmente com cerca de 50 usinas, e hÃ¡ outras 80 em fase de projeto. Segundo Pierre Girard, professor do Centro de Pesquisas do Pantanal, 70% do potencial hidrelÃ©trico da regiÃ£o jÃ¡ Ã© explorado e usar os 30% restantes nÃ£o traria benefÃ­cios significativos. â€œMas, como o custo da energia no Brasil Ã© alto, o negÃ³cio se torna lucrativo,â€ diz ele. Planeja-se tambÃ©m a construÃ§Ã£o de uma hidrovia interligando Brasil, Argentina, BolÃ­via e Uruguai, que serviria de canal de escoamento para a produÃ§Ã£o agrÃ­cola destinada ao mercado internacional, embora o governo ainda nÃ£o tenha fixado uma data para o inÃ­cio das obras. â€œO rio Paraguai parece uma cobra, Ã© cheio de curvas e reentrÃ¢ncias; e eles querem instalar a hidrovia numa linha reta. VocÃª faz ideia do impacto que isso teria? Seria um grande problema,â€ diz Silva, referindo-se aos danos para o ecossistema local caso o curso do rio seja alterado artificialmente. Um milhÃ£o de turistas por ano    O ecoturismo, que vem crescendo bastante, Ã© visto como uma atividade econÃ´mica capaz de preservar a regiÃ£o e, ao mesmo tempo, complementar a renda de seus habitantes. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   Quem pega um aviÃ£o e vai do planalto, onde estÃ£o as terras dedicadas Ã  agricultura extensiva e as usinas hidrelÃ©tricas, atÃ© a planÃ­cie, onde se espraia a extensÃ£o alagÃ¡vel do bioma, e lÃ¡ de cima vÃª a vastidÃ£o de mata exuberante e a profusÃ£o de lagos reluzentes e argÃªnteos, logo entende por que o Pantanal Ã© visitado por um milhÃ£o de turistas todos os anos. O ecoturismo, que vem crescendo bastante, Ã© visto como uma atividade econÃ´mica capaz de preservar a regiÃ£o e, ao mesmo tempo, complementar a renda de seus habitantes. Na Pousada Amolar, cujos nÃºcleos de hospedagem estÃ£o situados num complexo de Ã¡reas protegidas, declaradas pela Unesco como patrimÃ´nio natural mundial, na Serra do Amolar, o veterinÃ¡rio Diego Viana, do Instituto Homem Pantaneiro, coleta dados de 30 cÃ¢meras instaladas para monitorar onÃ§as-pintadas.   Quanto mais degradam o meio ambiente, maior Ã© a probabilidade de que seu gado seja atacado pelas onÃ§as  Diego Viana    TambÃ©m faz parte do seu trabalho visitar comunidades espalhadas pelo Pantanal, orientando as pessoas a nÃ£o matar esses animais, pelos quais os pantaneiros recebem somas vultosas de pecuaristas endinheirados. Viana diz que um onceiro â€“ indivÃ­duo especializado em matar onÃ§as â€“ chega a ganhar R$1,000 por animal abatido, o equivalente ao salÃ¡rio de um mÃªs de trabalho. A caÃ§a Ã s onÃ§as-pintadas Ã© proibida no Brasil, mas o caÃ§ador tem de ser apanhado em flagrante. Segundo Viana, mesmo que os fazendeiros percam gado para as onÃ§as e, em vista disso, tenham seus lucros reduzidos, abater os animais Ã© uma soluÃ§Ã£o mÃ­ope. â€œA onÃ§a-pintada estÃ¡ no topo da cadeia alimentar. VocÃª mata a onÃ§a e vai ter de se haver com mais veados, mais capivaras â€“ animais que transmitem doenÃ§as para o gado,â€ diz ele.    Os pantaneiros chegam a ganhar R$1,000 por onÃ§a-pintada abatida, o equivalente ao salÃ¡rio de um mÃªs de trabalho. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo   Os fazendeiros que derrubam Ã¡rvores para ampliar a Ã¡rea de lavoura e pastagens tambÃ©m sÃ£o um problema, diz o veterinÃ¡rio. â€œQuanto mais degradam o meio ambiente, maior Ã© a probabilidade de que seu gado seja atacado pelas onÃ§as.â€ Lutando por uma lei nova O CÃ³digo Florestal brasileiro nÃ£o contÃ©m dispositivos voltados especificamente para o Pantanal. Uma alteraÃ§Ã£o controversa na legislaÃ§Ã£o â€“ efetuada em 2013 por pressÃ£o do poderoso lobby do agronegÃ³cio â€“ diminuiu o tamanho das Ã¡reas de preservaÃ§Ã£o permanente ao redor das nascentes, o que pode ter consequÃªncias desastrosas para o Pantanal. Em razÃ£o disso, grupos de ativistas vÃªm lutando pela adoÃ§Ã£o de uma lei especÃ­fica para a regiÃ£o. â€œA ConstituiÃ§Ã£o diz que o Pantanal Ã© patrimÃ´nio nacional, indicando que a regiÃ£o deve ser alvo de legislaÃ§Ã£o especÃ­fica. Ã‰ nisso que estamos trabalhando no momento,â€ diz Girard. A ideia Ã© que o novo dispositivo abarque todo o Pantanal, incluindo as Ã¡reas de planalto adjacentes ao bioma, e se sobreponha ao CÃ³digo Florestal. O projeto de lei foi apresentado ao Senado em 2011 por Blairo Maggi, o controverso ex-governador do Mato Grosso e atual ministro da agricultura que Ã© popularmente conhecido como â€œo rei da sojaâ€, por ter sido, entre a dÃ©cada de 1990 e o inÃ­cio dos anos 2000, um dos maiores produtores mundiais do grÃ£o. De lÃ¡ para cÃ¡, grupos de ativistas tÃªm feito pressÃ£o para que o projeto de lei inclua melhores mecanismos de proteÃ§Ã£o para o Pantanal e seus habitantes. â€œTrata-se de uma lei sobre a restriÃ§Ã£o do uso â€“ coisas que vocÃª pode e que nÃ£o pode fazer, empregando o conceito de micro-habitats. Por exemplo: â€˜Aqui vocÃª pode fazer tal coisa, mas nesse outro lugar nÃ£oâ€™,â€ diz Girard. â€œÃ‰ preciso que a gente viva sob o impÃ©rio da lei.â€ Junte-se Ã  nossa comunidade de profissionais do desenvolvimento e ativistas da causa humanitÃ¡ria.

"Have you ever been to Enfield? I had never even heard of it until I was 23 and living in London for graduate school. One afternoon, I received notification that a package whose arrival I had been anticipating for days had been bogged down in customs and was now in a FedEx warehouse in Enfield, an unremarkable London suburb. I was outside my flat within minutes of receiving this news and on the train to Enfield within the hour, staring through the window at the gray sky. The package in question, sent from Los Angeles, contained my monthly supply of Adderall.Adderall, the brand name for a mixture of amphetamine salts, is more strictly regulated in Britain than in the United States, where, the year before, in 2005, I became one of the millions of Americans to be prescribed a stimulant medication.The train to Enfield was hardly the greatest extreme to which I would go during the decade I was entangled with Adderall. I would open other peopleâ€™s medicine cabinets, root through trash cans where I had previously disposed of pills, write friendsâ€™ college essays for barter. Once, while living in New Hampshire, I skipped a day of work to drive three hours each way to the health clinic where my prescription was still on file. Never was I more resourceful or unswerving than when I was devising ways to secure more Adderall.Adderall is prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a neurobehavioral condition marked by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that was first included in the D.S.M. in 1987 and predominantly seen in children. That condition, which has also been called Attention Deficit Disorder, has been increasingly diagnosed over recent decades: In the 1990s, an estimated 3 to 5 percent of school-age American children were believed to have A.D.H.D., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; by 2013, that figure was 11 percent. It continues to rise. And the increase in diagnoses has been followed by an increase in prescriptions. In 1990, 600,000 children were on stimulants, usually Ritalin, an older medication that often had to be taken multiple times a day. By 2013, 3.5 million children were on stimulants, and in many cases, the Ritalin had been replaced by Adderall, officially brought to market in 1996 as the new, upgraded choice for A.D.H.D. â€” more effective, longer lasting.Adderallâ€™s very name reflects its makersâ€™ hopes for an expanding customer base: â€œA.D.D. for allâ€ is the phrase that inspired it, Alan Schwarz writes in his new book, â€œA.D.H.D. Nation.â€ And in fact, by the time I arrived at college in 2000, four years after Adderall hit the market, nearly five million prescriptions were written; in 2005, the year after I graduated, that number was just under nine million. By then, sales of A.D.H.D. medication in the United States totaled more than $2 billion.By the mid-2000s, adults were the fastest-growing group receiving the drug. In 2012, roughly 16 million Adderall prescriptions were written for adults between ages 20 and 39, according to QuintilesIMS, an information-and-technology-services company that gathers health-care-related data. Adderall has now become ubiquitous on college campuses, widely taken by students both with and without a prescription. Black markets have sprung up at many, if not most, schools. In fact, according to a review published in 2012 in the journal Brain and Behavior, the off-label use of prescription stimulants had come to represent the second-most-common form of illicit drug use in college by 2004. Only marijuana was more popular.We know very little about what Adderall does over years of use, in and out of college, throughout all the experiences that constitute early adulthood. To date, there is almost no research on the long-term effects on humans of using Adderall. In a sense, then, we are the walking experiment, those of us around my age who first got involved with this drug in high school or college when it was suddenly everywhere and then did not manage to get off it for years afterward â€” if we got off it at all. We are living out what it might mean, both psychologically and neurologically, to take a powerful drug we do not need over long stretches of time. Sometimes I think of us as Generation Adderall.Adderall as we know it today owes its origins to accident. In the late 1920s, an American chemist named Gordon Alles, searching for a treatment for asthma, synthesized a substance related to adrenaline, which was known to aid bronchial relaxation. Alles had created beta-phenyl-isopropylamine, the chemical now known as amphetamine. Injecting himself to test the results, he noted a â€œfeeling of well being,â€ followed by a â€œrather sleepless night,â€ according to â€œOn Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine,â€ by Nicolas Rasmussen. By the 1930s, the drug Benzedrine, a brand-name amphetamine, was being taken to elevate mood, boost energy and increase vigilance. The American military dispensed Benzedrine tablets, also known as â€œgo pills,â€ to soldiers during World War II. After the war, with slight modification, an amphetamine called Dexedrine was prescribed to treat depression. Many people, especially women, loved amphetamines for their appetite-suppressing side effects and took them to stay thin, often in the form of the diet drug Obetrol. But in the early 1970s, with around 10 million adults using amphetamines, the Food and Drug Administration stepped in with strict regulations, and the drug fell out of such common use. More than 20 years later, a pharmaceutical executive named Roger Griggs thought to revisit the now largely forgotten Obetrol. Tweaking the formula, he named it Adderall and brought it to market aimed at the millions of children and teenagers who doctors said had A.D.H.D. A time-release version of Adderall came out a few years later, which prolonged the delivery of the drug to the bloodstream and which was said to be less addictive â€” and therefore easier to walk away from. In theory.The first time I took Adderall, I was a sophomore at Brown University, lamenting to a friend the impossibility of my plight: a five-page paper due the next afternoon on a book I had only just begun reading. â€œDo you want an Adderall?â€ she asked. â€œI canâ€™t stand it â€” it makes me want to stay up all night doing cartwheels in the hallway.â€Could there be a more enticing description? My friend pulled two blue pills out of tinfoil and handed them to me. An hour later, I was in the basement of the library, hunkered down in the Absolute Quiet Room, in a state of peerless ecstasy. The world fell away; it was only me, locked in a passionate embrace with the book I was reading and the thoughts I was having about it, which tumbled out of nowhere and built into what seemed an amazing pile of riches. When dawn came to Providence, R.I., I was hunched over in the grubby lounge of my dormitory, typing my last fevered perceptions, vaguely aware that outside the window, the sky was turning pink. I was alone in my new secret world, and that very aloneness was part of the great intoxication. I needed nothing and no one.I would experience this same sensation again and again over the next two years, whenever I could get my hands on Adderall on campus, which was frequently, but not, I began to feel, frequently enough. My Adderall hours became the most precious hours of my life, far too precious for the Absolute Quiet Room. I now needed to locate the most remote desk in the darkest, most neglected corner of the upper-level stacks, tucked farthest from the humming campus life going on outside. That life was no longer the life that interested me. Instead, what mattered, what compelled, were the hours I spent in isolation, poring over, for instance, Immanuel Kantâ€™s thoughts on â€œthe sublime.â€It was fitting: This was sublime, these afternoons I spent in untrammeled focus, absorbing the complicated ideas in the texts in front of me, mastering them, covering their every surface with my razor-like comprehension, devouring them, making them a part of myself. Or rather, of what I now thought of as my self, which is to say, the steely, undistractable person whom I vastly preferred to the lazier, glitchier person I knew my actual self to be, the one who was subject to fits of lassitude and a tendency to eat too many Swedish Fish.Adderall wiped away the question of willpower. Now I could study all night, then run 10 miles, then breeze through that weekâ€™s New Yorker, all without pausing to consider whether I might prefer to chat with classmates or go to the movies. It was fantastic. I lost weight. That was nice, too. Though I did snap at friends, abruptly accessing huge depths of fury I wouldnâ€™t have thought I possessed. When a roommate went home one weekend and forgot to turn off her alarm clock so that it beeped behind her locked door for 48 hours, I entirely lost control, calling her in New York to berate her. I didnâ€™t know how long it had been since Iâ€™d slept more than five hours. Why bother?By my senior year of college, my school work had grown more unmanageable, not less. For the first time in my life, I wasnâ€™t able to complete it. My droll, aristocratic Russian-history professor granted me an extension on the final term paper. One Friday evening well into December, when the idyllic New England campus had already begun to empty out for winter break, I was alone in the Sciences Library â€” the one that stayed open all night â€” squinting down at my notes on the Russian intelligentsia. Outside, it was blizzarding. Inside, the fluorescent lights beat down on the empty basement-level room. I felt dizzy and strange. It had been a particularly chemical week; several days had passed since I had slept more than a handful of hours, and I was taking more and more pills to compensate. Suddenly, when I looked up from the page, the bright room seemed to dilate around me, as if I werenâ€™t really there but rather stuck in some strange mirage. I seized with panic â€” what was happening? I tried to breathe, to snap myself back into reality, but I couldnâ€™t. Shakily, I stood and made my way toward the phones. I dialed my friend Dave in his dorm room. â€œIâ€™m having some kind of problem in the Sci Li,â€ I told him. My own voice sounded as if it belonged to someone else.An hour later, I was in an ambulance, being taken through the snowstorm to the nearest hospital. The volunteer E.M.T. was a Brown student Iâ€™d met once or twice. He held my hand the whole way. â€œAm I going to die?â€ I kept asking him. Dave and I sat for hours in the emergency room, until I was ushered behind a curtain and a skeptical-looking doctor came in to see me. I wasnâ€™t used to being looked at the way he was looking at me, which is to say, as if I were potentially insane, certifiable even. By then, I was feeling a little better, no longer so sure I was dying, and as I lay down on the examination table, I joked to him, â€œI will recline, like the Romans!â€ His expression remained unamused. I described what Iâ€™d been taking. His diagnosis: â€œAnxiety, amphetamine induced.â€ I had had my first panic attack â€” an uncommon but by no means unknown reaction to taking too much Adderall. When I left the hospital, I left behind the canister of blue pills that I had painstakingly scrounged together. I still remember the sight of it sitting next to the examination bed.A few days later, I drew incompletes in my classes and went back home to New York. My father knew about the hospital incident, but I promised him I would stop taking the drug. And I fully intended to. I spent that long winter break at the public library on 42nd Street, soldiering lethargically through the essays I hadnâ€™t been able to cope with while taking amphetamines. What I didnâ€™t know then, what I couldnâ€™t have known, was that the question of whether Adderall actually improves cognitive performance when taken off-label â€” whether or not it is a â€œsmart drugâ€ â€” was unresolved. It would be another few years before studies appeared showing that Adderallâ€™s effect on cognitive enhancement is more than a little ambiguous. Martha Farah, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has conducted much of this research. She has studied the effect of Adderall on subjects taking a host of standardized tests that measure restraint, memory and creativity. On balance, Farah and others have found very little to no improvement when their research subjects confront these tests on Adderall. Ultimately, she says, it is possible that â€œlower-performing people actually do improve on the drug, and higher-performing people show no improvement or actually get worse.â€My pill-free period didnâ€™t last very long. I turned in my incomplete school work and duly received my grades, but by graduation that spring, I was again locked into the familiar pattern, the blissful intensity and isolation followed by days of slow-motion comedown, when I would laze around for hours, eating spoonfuls of ice cream from the carton, desperate for the sugar rush, barely able to muster the energy necessary to take a shower.It took me exactly one year from the time of college graduation to come to the decision that would, to a great extent, shape the next phase of my life. It hit me like a revelation: It might be possible to declare my independence from the various A.D.H.D. kids who sold me their prescription pills at exorbitant markups and get a prescription all my own. The idea occurred to me as I walked among the palm trees on the campus of U.C.L.A. By then, I was living in Los Angeles, working as a private tutor for high-school kids, many of whom were themselves on Adderall, and taking summer-school classes in psychology and neuroscience in order to be able to apply for graduate school. I had decided I wanted to be a psychologist â€” infinitely more manageable than my secret ambition of being a writer, I thought. Infinitely more realistic. Like many 20-somethings, my decisions were informed by panic and haste, but also, of course, by whatever short-lived supply of the pills I happened to be in possession of.I was now surrounded â€” or had surrounded myself â€” by others caught up in the Adderall web. Together with two of my closest friends in Los Angeles that year, we traversed the city in a state of perpetual, hyped-up intensity, exchanging confidences that later we would not recall. Adderall was the currency of our friendship; when one of us ran short of pills, another would cover the deficit. Driving through Los Angeles in a sun-drenched trance, weaving in and out of traffic, I found it all too easy to lose track of exactly how many pills I had swallowed that day.As soon as it occurred to me that I might be able to get my own prescription, I went to the nearest campus computer and searched for â€œcognitive behavioral psychiatrist, Westwood, Los Angeles, California.â€ I knew enough about psychology by then to avoid the psychoanalysts, who would want to go deep and talk to me for weeks or maybe months about why I felt I needed chemical enhancement. No, I couldnâ€™t turn to them â€” I needed a therapist with an M.D., a focus on concrete â€œresultsâ€ and an office within a 10-minute drive of U.C.L.A.The very next day, I was sitting in exactly the kind of place I had envisioned, an impersonal room with gray walls and black leather furniture, describing to the attractive young psychiatrist in the chair opposite me how I had always had to develop elaborate compensatory strategies for getting through my school work, how staying with any one thing was a challenge for me, how I was best at jobs that required elaborate multitasking, like waitressing. Untrue, all of it. I was a focused student and a terrible waitress. And yet these were the answers that I discovered from the briefest online research were characteristic of the A.D.H.D. diagnostic criteria. These were the answers they were looking for in order to pick up their pens and write down â€œAdderall, 20 mg, once a dayâ€ on their prescription pads. So these were the answers I gave.Fifty minutes later, I was standing on San Vicente Boulevard in the bright California sun, prescription slip in hand. That single doctorâ€™s assessment, granted in less than an hour, would follow me everywhere I went: through the rest of my time in Los Angeles; then off to London, with the help of FedEx; then to New Haven, where I would pick it up once a month at the Yale Health Center; then back to New York, where the doctor I found on my insurance plan would have no problem continuing to prescribe this medication, based only on my saying that it had been previously prescribed to me, that Iâ€™d been taking it for years.Any basic neuroscience textbook will explain how Adderall works in the brain â€” and why itâ€™s so hard to break the habit. For years, the predominant explanation of addiction, promulgated by researchers like Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has revolved around the neurotransmitter dopamine. Amphetamines unleash dopamine along with norepinephrine, which rush through the brainâ€™s synapses and increase levels of arousal, attention, vigilance and motivation. Dopamine, in fact, tends to feature in every experience that feels especially great, be it having sex or eating chocolate cake. Itâ€™s for this reason that dopamine is so heavily implicated in current models of addiction. As a person begins to overuse a substance, the brain â€” which craves homeostasis and fights for it â€” tries to compensate for all the extra dopamine by stripping out its own dopamine receptors. With the reduction of dopamine receptors, the person needs more and more of her favored substance to produce the euphoria it once offered her. The vanishing dopamine receptors also help explain the agony of withdrawal: Without that favored substance, a person is suddenly left with a brain whose capacity to experience reward is well below its natural levels. It is an open question whether every brain returns to its original settings once off the drug.Nearly three years after getting the prescription, in 2008, I found myself sobbing in a psychiatristâ€™s office in New Haven, where I was finishing graduate school, explaining to him that my life was no longer my own. I had long been telling myself that by taking Adderall, I was exerting total control over my fallible self, but in truth, it was the opposite: The Adderall made my life unpredictable, blowing black storm systems over my horizon with no warning at all. Still, I couldnâ€™t give it up. The psychiatrist was a kind Serbian man with an unflappable expression. He observed my distress calmly and prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant with a slightly speedy quality that could cushion the blow of withdrawal and make it less painful to get off the Adderall. His theory was sound. But soon enough, I was simply taking both medications.Through my Adderall years, I lived a paradox, believing that the drug was indispensable to my very survival while also knowing that it was nothing short of toxic, poisonous to art, love and life. By 2009, I had a contract to write a book about psychoanalysis and neuroscience; shortly after, I took a day job as a reporter for a news website. What was required of me there was the constant filing of short, catchy pieces: to be quick and glib and move on to the next one. It was the kind of rhythm perfect for an Adderall-head like me â€” and the kind of writing at odds with the effort to think slowly and carefully, at book length. The goal of slow and careful thinking came to feel more and more anachronistic with each passing week. It didnâ€™t escape me that just as Adderall was surging onto the market in the 1990s, so, too, was the internet, that the two have ascended within American life in perfect lock-step.Occasionally, I would try to get off the drug. Each attempt began the same way. Step 1: the rounding up of all the pills in my possession, including those secret stashes hidden away in drawers and closets. Debating for hours whether to keep just one, â€œfor emergencies.â€ Then the leap of faith and the flushing of the pills down the toilet. Step 2: a day or two of feeling all right, as if I could manage this after all. Step 3: a bleak slab of time when the effort needed to get through even the simple tasks of a single day felt stupendous, where the future stretched out before me like a grim series of obligations I was far too tired to carry out. All work on my book would stop. Panic would set in. Then, suddenly, an internal Adderall voice would take over, and I would jump up from my desk and scurry out to refill my prescription â€” almost always a simple thing to achieve â€” or borrow pills from a friend, if need be. And the cycle would begin again. Those moments were all shrouded in secrecy and shame. Very few people in my life knew the extent to which the drug had come to define me.Over the years, Iâ€™ve been told by various experts on the subject that it should not have been so hard to get off Adderall. The drug is supposed to be relatively quick and painless to relinquish. Iâ€™ve often wondered whether my inability to give it up was my deepest failing. Iâ€™ve found some comfort in seeing my own experience mirrored back to me in the dozens and dozens of disembodied voices on the internet, filling the message boards of the websites devoted to giving up this drug. One post, in particular, has stayed with me, a mother writing on QuittingAdderall.com:I started taking Adderall in OCT 2010. And my story isnâ€™t much different than most. ... The honeymoon period, then all downhill. I feel like I cannot remember who I was, or how it felt, to go one minute of the day not on Adderall. I look back at pictures of myself from before this began and I wonder how I was ever â€œhappyâ€ without it because now I am a nervous wreck if I even come close to not having my pills for the day. There have been nights I have cried laying my daughter down to sleep because I was so ashamed that the time she spent with her mommy that day wasnâ€™t real. â€œNobody starts off by saying, Iâ€™m going to go develop a drug problem,â€ said Jeanette Friedman, a social worker with a specialty in addiction, when I met her in August at her Upper East Side office. â€œNo one means to get addicted. But thereâ€™s such a casual use of something like Adderall nowadays â€” because itâ€™s seen as benign, or a help to becoming more productive. And in our culture, to be productive is kind of everything. Thereâ€™s a tremendous pressure not just to do well but to excel.â€When she is face to face with an addicted patient, Friedman explains, what is at stake is that patientâ€™s very ability â€œto become a full person without the shadow of always needing something.â€ Adderall complicates the usual dynamic of drug addiction by being squarely associated with productivity, achievement and success. â€œItâ€™s very hard to think about going off it, because you donâ€™t know if youâ€™re going to be able to produce,â€ she says. â€œPlenty of people have gone off of it and have been able to tell the story, that yes, they definitely can produce. But the fear of not being able to is what keeps people still using.â€I remember that fear, in school and, later, at work, and itâ€™s palpable in those message-board pleas:The way I feel now is way worse than my A.D.D. ever was before I went on this stuff. I no longer feel, at this present time, able to get a Ph.D. I donâ€™t feel able to do coursework, I donâ€™t feel interested and passionate about the things I loved. I need to know from you, dear readers, that this will be temporary.Harris Stratyner, a psychologist and addiction specialist at the Caron Treatment Center in Manhattan, told me that each year heâ€™s in practice, he sees more people desperate to get off Adderall. Stratyner estimates that he has treated more than 50 patients trying to stop using the drug; currently, they range in age from 24 to 40. His Adderall patients are overwhelmingly creative people who wanted to work in the arts â€” yet, he says, many have chosen other paths, safer paths, resigning themselves before theyâ€™ve even really tried to achieve what they hoped for. â€œThey often give in to practicality,â€ he says. â€œThen they feel they missed out. And when they take Adderall, it makes them feel good, so they donâ€™t focus on the fact that they feel like they sold out.â€ Many people are using Adderall to mask a sense of disappointment in themselves, Stratyner says, because it narrows their focus down to simply getting through each day, instead of the larger context of what theyâ€™re trying to build with their lives. â€œIt becomes extremely psychologically and physiologically addictive,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s really a tough drug to get off of.â€ The side effects of Adderall withdrawal that his patients report include nausea, chills, diarrhea, body aches and pains, even seizures. Occasionally, it is necessary for him to hospitalize his patients as they come down off Adderall.In the end, I did not get off Adderall alone. I had a brilliant psychiatrist. I believe she saved my life. On the wall of her office, she had a single image: a framed print of an Henri Matisse painting. Through our time together, Matisse came to stand for the creative process. You start one place, go through hell and wind up somewhere else, somewhere that surprises you. Adderall, we both agreed, was a perversion of that journey. Gradually, her words entered my inner dialogue and sustained me. I was 30 by the time I got off Adderall for good. This statement horrifies me even now, more than three years later, recognizing the amount of precious time I gave away to that drug.During the first weeks of finally giving up Adderall, the fatigue was as real as it had been before, the effort required to run even a tiny errand momentous, the gym unthinkable. The cravings were a force of their own: If someone so much as said â€œAdderallâ€ in my presence, I would instantly begin to scheme about how to get just one more pill. Or maybe two. I was anxious, terrified I had done something irreversible to my brain, terrified that I was going to discover that I couldnâ€™t write at all without my special pills. I didnâ€™t yet know that it would only be in the amphetamine-free years to follow that my book would finally come together.Even in those first faltering weeks, there were consolations. Simple pleasures were available to me again. I laughed more in conversation with my friends, and I noticed that they did, too. I had spent years of my life in a state of false intensity, always wondering if I should be somewhere else, working harder, achieving more. In the deep lethargy of withdrawal, I could shed that chemical urgency that kept me at a subtle distance from everyone around me â€” and from myself.On one of those earliest days of being off the drug, I was moving slowly, more than a little daunted, trying to walk the few miles to an appointment I had in Midtown Manhattan. It was a glorious summer evening, the sun just going down. As I approached Bryant Park, I heard live music and wandered in to see. A rock band was performing onstage. I hovered at the back of the crowd. The singer, muscular and bearded, gripped the microphone in front of him with two hands, pouring his heart into every word that left his mouth. His voice soared into that summer night. Suddenly, tears were streaming down my face. I was embarrassed, but I couldnâ€™t stop. It was as if I hadnâ€™t heard music in years.",1
"Dont Fight the SystemDan and Sheila Gendron, Contributors Fighting the system to fix (or resurrect) it, is the same as fighting over who gets the tenderloin steak off a dead and rotting cow. For many of you I am sure this will be an extremely radical statement. But if that system led us to the morass of greed and evil in which we are today, wouldnt it be better to step aside while it collapses and help lead society toward a better paradigm, based more on caring about others than about squeezing the last penny out of some useless consumer product? Just what is the system? The system is an interlocked, interdependent, inter-cooperative combine of societal control. These systems work their tentacles into all facets of society, including: Contrary to what you may think, these institutions are not there to serve you. They serve only themselves. The education system is designed to program you with societal lies and put you in a situation that will deeply program the insecurities that will be exploited by the corporations and governments in your later life. If you dont know why so many schools and so many scholars could be bent to the dark side, it is really not difficult to understand. It all has to do with money. If you pride yourself as an academic (someone who has gone to college gone to school most of their lives and doesnt stop because they keep getting rewarded for being such excellent repeaters), someone has to pay the tab for this to be possible for you. How is it done? It is done mostly with grants. These are used by corporations and governments to give the academic seal of approval to the governmental or corporate baloney. Lets say Im a pharmaceutical company and I want research done on my particular drug so that I gain government approval. I, as the corporation, get to decide who gets this research grant. Savvy academics know how to make themselves desirable to government grants and corporate payoffs. The academics need only write white papers on the benefits of a particular drug (or the need for homeland security or global warming issues, etc.) and grant money will flow in their direction. So the academic merry-go-round goes, spewing baloney as truth with the academic seal of approval. The elementary and secondary (high) school system is just as filled with baloney as the college level, but gives the students a good background and training in how to accept and repeat the baloney while getting them used to taking orders from the authorities and being good little compliant citizens (read: consumer slaves). That system also makes sure the good instincts like asking thoughtful questions are turned into insecurities for being different than everyone else. Government Government is a euphemism for our gang. The government operates no differently than the Mafia or any common street gang. If you are an aficionado of Monty Python you may have seen one of their more popular sketches with the Facotti Brothers. Soaked with sarcasm and irony, the two brothers visit an army base and try to shake it down for protection money. One of the brothers says to the colonel, You got a lot of really nice tanks here, Colonel. Itd be a shame if something happened to them. This, in a nutshell, is how all governments work state, county, municipal, federal, world (the U.N. and the soon-coming one world government) they all have the same racket. That racket is harvesting money from their human resources under the guise of serving them. I recently read an article about an Englishman who bought a piece of rural land in what the English call the north country and got himself some cows, goats, chickens, solar power, built himself a small home and was an excellent model of self-sufficiency. He was contacted by the Borough Council and was told that he must return to his suburban London home, enroll his children in school, pay his pole tax, get himself and his family inoculated, reconnect to the grid, buy his food at the grocery store, etc. even though he had achieved 100% self-sufficiency or risk jail. It was just their gangs way of saying we need our piece or something gets broken. Those of us who have seen beyond the veil understand that empty euphemisms like for the betterment of society, for society as a whole and, last but not least, for the children (by far their favorite), are used to hold you into society. Years ago, our daughter, who never had a social security number, went to get a passport. She told us that the people at the passport office actually seemed scared of her because she did not have a SSN. What on earth could possibly be frightening about not having an SSN at 18 years old? Truth is, the only thing frightening is how you are conditioned to respond to it, not the condition whatsoever. In order for governments to maintain their hegemony, they absolutely need servile, docile taxpayers. Without that they no longer exist. Like the Mafia needs people paying them for their protection, the government needs your compliance! At least the Mafia has a rulethey dont involve civilians in their business. That is, unless you borrow money from a loan shark, rent one of their prostitutes or make a bet with them, you are pretty much hands-off to them. But the government claims you the moment you flow out of the river of the womb (investigate what Jordan Maxwell says about a birth certificate being like the birthing of a boat and why Admiralty law is the de facto law of this country. Note the gold fringed flag of the seas). Its all about taking back your sovereign rights. No government or system gives you those rights. They must be claimed and accepted on a daily basis by you, personally. Corporations The primary directive of a corporation is to extract their pound of flesh from their human resources at hand in the most cost-effective way. When you consider that the raison detre of a corporation is to obtain the most profits for the corporation as possible, it makes sense for them to cut every corner, pay every employee as little as possible, squeeze every penny from the consumers by making a cheaper albeit lower quality product. What the corporation by definition needs not consider is, is this the right thing to do, the ethical or positive thing to do? Efficiency is how they euphemistically describe this penny pinching money grubbing. The sterile inhospitable dcor of a Wal-mart is a stunning example of corporate efficiency. Psychologists, psychiatrists and human relations experts are the directors of this environment. Their job is to find the most efficient ways to exploit all the insecurities you have had hard-wired into you by the advertising gurus and, like a combine tearing through a wheat field, harvest all the edible fruit it can. If you have never seen the documentary film, The High Cost of Low Prices it is a real window into the corporate world. It shows the worker abuse, anti-union activities, lack of health care and (this is rich) Wal-mart instructing its employees on how they can also collect welfare, WIC, food stamps, etc. to augment their lack of a living wage. All ways to keep you in the grasp of the system. Sadly, the only reason that I have had to ever set foot in a Wal-Mart was because the other grocery and retail establishments to whom I would have gladly paid higher prices, had been put out of business by Wal-mart. Suffice to say, big business/corporations do not have your best interests at heart. Whenever posed with a choice, choose a small, local business to spend your dollars with. The goal for all American workers is for us to be like good Wal-Mart employees, making less than a paycheck you can live on, and dependent on the government hand-outs to make up the difference. Can you say slavery? Heres someone with a clear understanding: Banking The Banking system, if you really look at it, is the greatest scam ever. In a nutshell, the Federal Reserve creates money (electronic credits, really) out of thin air just on their own say so and then sells it to the governments at interest. The money to pay the interest is also created out of thin air and is also sold at interest, so that they systems cycle never ends. There are plenty of places on the Internet that explain this in detail. We recommend watching at least the economic section in the movie, Zeitgeist: Addendum by Peter Joseph, and our article, The Economic Illusion Laid Bare. Pop Culture Pop Culture is broadly defined as our entertainment TV, movies, radio, music, magazines all designed to maintain the consumerist lifestyle. Any doubt of this at all and you need only to pick up a copy of Mother Earth News and see how utterly commercial even they have become. These institutions are also employed to exploit the deep-seated insecurities we have had hard-wired into us from education, government, corporations, et al. Some things they do are very subtle, like the 29.9 flicker rate standard on a TV that is designed to put your brain into a mid-theta state. The theta state is the one in which the subconscious mind is most vulnerable to suggestion. It is possible to watch a TV show or movie, fall deeply into a theta state without knowing it and then, exploiting the natural rhythms of your mind, they can implant, word-by-word, buried within the dialogue, a particular set of programming that is, mental programming. Have you ever wondered why they call it PROGRAMMING? Nothing goes across the mainstream media news outlets that isnt sanitized and specifically constructed to bring about the desired result. The CIA has had case officers working all major media outfits long before 9/11. This is even admitted by our government. If you were aware that watching TV some number of hours a day literally changes your mind and removes your free will, would you really watch it? Sadly for many of us, life without our favorite TV show would be just too unbearable. But if reading this has woken you up TURN YOUR ********* TV OFF!!! It does not serve you. It serves others who do not have your best interests at heart. Even Sesame Street (especially Sesame Street) is used to start the training early. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order said, Give me a child for for his first seven years and Ill give you the man. If you feel uncomfortable about disconnecting yourself from the system, remember TPTB have conditioned you to feel uncomfortable about thinking these kinds of thoughts. If you choose the freedom of self-reliance, its perfectly normal to feel even scared. If you think all your thoughts are yours, please re-read this and try to form a clear thought process. For some of you I know it will be a new experience, but once you can see that the system is designed to make you into a good worker (slave)/consumer and nothing more, you should understand their need to keep you in the system, and how good it is to be out. Every part of the system is in existence because you agree to be a part of it, you agree to accept that it has power. Dont give it power by fighting against it. Our intention we believe that our intentions create our realities is to help you to extract yourself from being someone elses human resource and become your own resource.

"In many ways he â€“ the star of Him (ITV) â€“ is like any other 17-year-old boy: uncommunicative, misunderstood, angry, frequently stoned. He (we donâ€™t know his name) is also the product of his parentsâ€™ divorce, and now he bounces between two homes, an unwelcome pinball. He also has powers. You know, special ones. â€œYouâ€™ll need to keep an open mind over this, suspend your disbelief,â€ says the female narrator, whose identity we donâ€™t yet know. So, as a toddler, he could open his bedroom door by looking at it, after his dad shut him in the dark. Later, he mind-hurled a cricket ball through the patio doors to stop his parents fighting. Then it gets heavier: he opens the bonnet of his dadâ€™s BMW at speed on the motorway. Well, he â€“ Dad (itâ€™s not easy writing about Him when the boy hasnâ€™t got a name) â€“ was being a dick. But He (thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™ll uppercase Him) is in the car, too, also His mum and His baby half-brother; they would all have been killed in the accident that very nearly happens. He needs to get better at controlling the powers. Somehow, Dad swerves across three lanes of traffic and up the verge with no casualties ... this time. We havenâ€™t heard Him speak yet. Can He? Yes. â€œNo battery,â€ He grunts, as an excuse for not calling home. Heâ€™s now at His mumâ€™s, where she lives with her new fella, who is trying to play the discipline card â€“ which isnâ€™t going down well with Him. Suddenly a load of tools â€“ chisels, hammers, screwdrivers, anything dangerous â€“ extract themselves from their box and dance above stepdadâ€™s head. Ha! Itâ€™s more comic than scary, to be honest. He does manage to control the powers this time, and rebox the dancing chisels before they plunge themselves into stepdadâ€™s skull. It can be a force for good, too. On the way to school, He does magic tricks to amuse His mates. They call Him Dynamo, obviously (although I donâ€™t know why they donâ€™t get Him to do Dynamoâ€™s hanging off-the-side-of-the-bus trick, then, seeing as they are on a double-decker and He almost certainly could). Newly arrived stepsister is not impressed. She, it turns out, is the narrator. And at His grannyâ€™s old peepsâ€™ home, He mind-switches channels on the telly because the staff arenâ€™t paying attention, or theyâ€™re not paid enough to do the TV. Ginoâ€™s Italian Escape is what they want to watch, incidentally; I can see how Ginoâ€™s charm would appeal to an older lady. Granny is the only other person who knows about His powers; her husband had them, too, and that didnâ€™t end well. Itâ€™s genetic, then, and skips generations. Like red hair, only scarier. I donâ€™t think this is going to end well, either. Well, stepsister-narrator keeps hinting at it. And the episode doesnâ€™t end well. Not for His stepmother (who is very pregnant with twins), or for her house. Bloody hell! Again, more of an amused â€œbloody hellâ€ than a behind-the-sofa â€œbloody hellâ€. Go on, boy, sheâ€™s a dick, too. Although I do worry for the babies. Him descends too suddenly into full-on horror to be properly creepy. Thereâ€™s no buildup â€“ itâ€™s straight in with the dancing chisels. And some of the dialogue is a bit clunky: â€œWhen you moved up north with your mother, I know we didnâ€™t see as much [of each other],â€ stepdad says to his daughter, more because we need that information than because anyone would really say that. But itâ€™s a nice performance from newcomer Fionn Whitehead and, the supernatural aside, itâ€™s good on that difficult time between childhood and adulthood. Also on divorce, second families, what they can do to first ones and vice versa. And if I meet a teenager with a nosebleed (thatâ€™s what happens to Him, when things kick off), Iâ€™ll try not to make him cross. *** As if to disprove my buildup thing, Crazyhead (E4) is scary right from the off. A girl, Suzanne, is bound and gagged in the boot of a car, is driven at night to a deserted industrial area. The boot is opened by â€¦ SCARY CLOWNS! (Nice â€“ or lucky â€“ timing.) They drag her out and prepare to do whatever theyâ€™re going to do to her â€“ but she manages to get the gag off. â€œAmy, I know thatâ€™s you, thatâ€™s my jacket,â€ she says to one of the clowns, who is, indeed, her best friend. But right now Suzanne is possessed by demons and she needs to be exorcised. Step one: piss on her. And thatâ€™s how Crazyhead, the baby of Misfits creator Howard Overman, carries on: terrifying one minute, silly the next; behind the sofa, LOL, back behind the sofa. Which is the idea: itâ€™s comedy-horror â€“ silly, scary, smart, dark. Hey, it might even have something to do with mental health, too.",1

"5 Charts Which Show That The Next Economic Crash Is Dead AheadMichael Snyder Some people would have you believe that nobody can anticipate the next great economic downturn and that to try to do so is just an exercise in guesswork. But that is not the case at all. We can look back over history and see patterns that keep repeating. And a lot of the exact same patterns that happened just before previous stock market crashes are happening again right now. For example, lets talk about the price of oil. There are only two times in history when the price of oil has fallen by more than 50 dollars in a six-month time period. One was just before the financial crisis in 2008, and the other has just happened As a result of crashing oil prices, we are witnessing oil rigs shut down in the United States at a blistering pace. In fact, almost half of all oil rigs in the U.S. have already shut down. The following commentary and chart come from Wolf Richter For example, just check out the disturbing numberthat just came out of Texas Ouch. But this pain is going to be felt far beyond Texas. In recent years, Wall Street banks have made a massive amount of money packaging up energy industry loans, bonds, etc. and selling them off to investors. If that sounds similar to the kind of behavior that preceded the subprime mortgage meltdown, that is because it is. Now those loans, bonds, etc. are going bad as the fracking bust intensifies, and whoever is left holding all of this worthless paper at the end of the day is going to lose an extraordinary amount of money. Here is morefrom Wolf Richter At the same time, we are also witnessing a slowdown in global trade. This usually happens when economic conditions are about to turn sour, and that is why it is so alarming that the total volume of global trade in January was down 1.4 percent from December. According toTyler Durden of Zero Hedge, that was the largest drop since 2011 We are seeing some troubling signs in the U.S. as well. I shared the following chartin a previous article, but it bears repeating. It comes from Charles Hugh Smith, and it shows that new orders for consumer goods are falling at a rate not seen since the last recession Well, what about the stock market? It was up more than 200 points on Monday. Isnt that good news? Yes, but the euphoria on Wall Street will not last for long. When corporate earnings per share either start flattening out or start to decline, that is a huge red flag. We saw this just prior to the stock market crash of 2008, and it is happening again right now. The following commentary and chart comefrom Phoenix Capital Research And guess what? According to CNBC, a lot of the smart money is pulling their money out of the stock market right now while the getting is good It doesnt matter if you are a millionaire on paper today. What matters is if the money is going to be there when you really need it. At the moment, a whole lot of people have been lulled into a false sense of complacency by the soaring stock market and by the bubble of false economic stability that we have been enjoying. But under the surface, there is a whole lot of turmoil going on. Those that are looking for the signs are going to see the next crisis approaching well in advance. Those that are not are going to get absolutely blindsided by what is coming. Dont let that happen to you. This article first appeared here at the Economic Collapse Blog.

"U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has opened his fortified island headquarters to participants in his second no-holds-barred martial arts tournament, the enigmatic mastermind announced Monday. Donald Rumsfeld 'Warriors of the world, hear me,' said Rumsfeld, seated on the onyx throne overlooking the fighting arena at the island's central volcano, surrounded by a phalanx of exotic but murderous beauties and his seven-foot-tall guard Omarra. 'I declare the Eagle Fist all-styles, hand-to-hand combat world championship open once more. For the next 10 days, the world's mightiest fighters will come together here at Fang Island to compete for a prize of $1 million and the post of Associate Secretary Of Full-Contact Defense!' Rumsfeld then declared the tournament open by symbolically shattering a block of obsidian with his prosthetic dragon's clawthe powerful weapon grafted onto his right wrist after 2003 champion Li severed his hand with manji butterfly swords. 'Who can deny that conflict is a purifying flame which sears away cowardice, hesitation, sentimentall that which is unworthy in Man?' Rumsfeld said, stroking his albino cheetah. 'And my fighting arena is the crucible which concentrates that fire into the refined white heat of invincibility. The victor of my Eagle Fist Tournament shall be, by nature and definition, unsurpassed in the ways of the warrior. Such a fighter is fit to be the instrument of Rumsfeld.' The defense secretary then described the plan for the tournamenta single-elimination series of bouts in which two fighters, matched by drawn lots, will remain locked in combat until one is physically unable to continue. Once the round concludes, the victor will be given a night and day to rest before the next match. At no time will a fighter be free to roam Fang Island's sealed areas. Rumsfeld's Fang Island headquarters. 'I do not forget last year's incident with Li,' Rumsfeld said, fingering the jagged scar on his neck that he received in an ambush last year. 'He was an enemy of freedom, and he dishonored us with his treachery. I regret that I was only able to give him a scar to match mine, and not the death he so richly deserved. Though he escaped in cowardice, he cannot hide forever.' According to Rumsfeld, the finest students of every martial philosophy traveled from around the globe to take part in the tournament. While some come only to pursue the honor of the title of King Of Eagle Fist, others see the event as a chance to pursue shadowy motives of personal gain, ambition, and revenge. 'I'm six months worth of gambling debt in the hole with the L.A. Syndicate,'' said Steele Saxon, 33, a blond, powerfully built seventh-degree black belt from Los Angeles. 'Guy says to me, 'Hey, pal, it's the dough or we break something. Rumsfeld's got the dough if I've got the muscle. You just watch. Together, we've got the juice to put those Syndicate types in the rear-view mirror of history.' 'Man, they ain't seen unorthodox-but-effective until they seen me,' said the languid Jack 'Chocolate Lightning' Garrison, the two-time East Coast Freestyle Kung-Fu champion once described by SuckaPunch magazine as 'six feet of stone-cold brotha and 10 inches of afro barely contained in a fly lemon-yellow jumpsuit.' 'I won't waste my time with defeat,' Garrison added. 'I'll be too busy looking good.' The biggest X-factor in this year's Eagle Fist may be the mysterious masked and hooded Nameless One, a fighter of feline grace who practices 'the technique of no-technique.' Sun Chang (right) fights Ebony Avalanche for Rumsfeld's amusement. 'I do not thinkI feel,' the Nameless One said, a sliver of light illuminating only his smoldering eyes. 'The technique of your opponent is like a finger pointing at the moon. Concentrate on the finger, and you will miss all that heavenly glory. That is the secret, to fight without fighting. At the last, Rumsfeld shall know what I know. I will share my victory with this... Don.' The Eagle Fist Tournament has come under fire from critics in America who characterize the fortress, purchased at taxpayers' expense, as a grandstanding ploy to divert attention from Iraq and the stalled war on terrorism. 'What exactly is this meant to achieve?' reporter James Snyder asked, hours before he disappeared from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram building. 'Why does the Department of Defense need to determine who the world's premier open-hand fighter is and then retain his or her services for the next year? And why did Rumsfeld have the Guantnamo Bay prisoners chained and placed in the labyrinthine caverns below Fang Island? And how on earth does 'conflict sear away cowardice'? Patriot Act or no, we have a right to some answers.' Rumsfeld, wandering among his collection of antique torture implements and feeding candied figs to his golden langur, said he remains unmoved. 'See here,' Rumsfeld said, indicating a gold-encrusted Minoan iron maiden. 'It is difficult to associate horrors with the proud civilizations that created them: Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the Samurai. They worshipped strength, because strength is the fundament for all other values. I shall find the strongest of all, and together, we shall shake the world to its very foundations.' ",0
"Plans for a third runway at Heathrow have received a significant boost after the Scottish government announced its backing for the scheme, which it claimed would create up to 16,000 jobs across Scotland. Holyrood made the announcement amid mounting speculation that the Westminster government is to back a third runway in the coming weeks, ending years of arguments over airport expansion.   Related: Top anti-Heathrow Tories will miss vote on third runway   Environmental campaigners and Green politicians decried the move as â€œa disaster for climate changeâ€, and questioned whether the promised jobs stimulus would come to pass.  The cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work, Keith Brown, called on Theresa Mayâ€™s government to follow Scotlandâ€™s lead. â€œItâ€™s now time for the UK government to end its costly prevarication on airport expansion and support Heathrowâ€™s plans to ensure Scotland, and the United Kingdom as a whole, can begin to reap the rewards on offer,â€ he said. A series of commitments, including on jobs, investigating the use of Glasgow Prestwick airport as a potential site for a logistics hub for building the third runway, and a reduction of Â£10 per passenger on landing charges paid by airlines operating services from Heathrow to Scotland, will be included in a memorandum of understanding signed between London Heathrow airport and the SNP government on Monday. Announcing the memorandum, Brown said the Scottish government had engaged extensively with Gatwick and Heathrowâ€™s expansion proposals, and the latterâ€™s offered the best deal for Scotland.  â€œWe have been clear from the start of this process that we wanted the best deal for Scotland and building a third runway at Heathrow provides the most significant benefits to the countryâ€™s economy and connectivity,â€ he said. â€œGrowing the number of direct international air routes to and from Scotland remains a priority for this government, but the proposals from Heathrow offer all our airports a range of benefits that will help them grow passenger numbers and continue to build on their successes.â€    John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow CEO. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian   John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow, said the partnership demonstrated how the expansion could work â€œfor every region and nation of the UKâ€. He said an expanded Heathrow would create up to 16,000 jobs in Scotland.  â€œIt would facilitate more airlines flying routes to Scottish airports, meaning more flights, more competition and choice for families and businesses across the nation. That also means more visitors to Scotland, more destinations for Scottish tourists and more opportunity for Scottish businesses to reach new export markets,â€ Holland-Kaye said. Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, questioned the job creation figure, saying: â€œEvery time there is discussion about airport expansion of any kind, it is accompanied by ridiculous jobs figures, but it is difficult to see how 16,000 new jobs could materialise with just a bit more direct traffic.â€ Dixon said it was self-evident that any increase in flights would equally take people and money out of Scotland: â€œIf it is easier to fly somewhere else then people will do their business elsewhere so that takes business out of Scotland too, and balances out any increase.â€ He said his biggest concern was the impact on the environment. â€œThe biggest disappointment is that the Scottish government talks a good game about climate change and here they are backing the expansion of one of our biggest airports, which will result in 70% more traffic and emissions. If weâ€™re concerned about climate change we canâ€™t possibly expand aviation even more.â€  Throughout the Scottish National partyâ€™s conference, which begins in Glasgow on Thursday, Heathrow will operate a â€œprivate, airport-style loungeâ€ with a free bar to promote the benefits of the expansion to Scotland, as it did at last yearâ€™s event in Aberdeen.   There have been complaints that the SNP has priced non-corporate campaigners out of the event, with the cost of the cheapest, single stall for a charity this year rising to nearly Â£3,000. An alternative fringe, to run concurrently with the SNP conference at a nearby â€“ and more affordable â€“ venue, will include Friends of the Earth Scotland.   Related: Heathrow airport expansion plan may be put to free cabinet vote   The Scottish Greensâ€™ transport spokesman criticised the SNPâ€™s â€œflawed thinkingâ€. John Finnie said: â€œExpansion of hugely polluting aviation can only be a disaster for the climate, not to mention the impact on local communities. The Scottish government are flawed in thinking that more of everything is somehow sustainable.  â€œMaintaining air links between cities as far apart as Inverness and London makes sense, but at the same time we must invest in improvements to our rail network and make it easy to use technology to do business from anywhere in Scotland. Thatâ€™s where the Scottish governmentâ€™s efforts should be focused. The growth of airports is a last-century idea and thatâ€™s where it should stay.â€  May is believed to favour expansion at Heathrow, despite opposition from members of her cabinet including Boris Johnson and Justine Greening. Las week Zac Goldsmith, a longstanding opponent of the Heathrow plan, reiterated that he would quit as an MP if the government gave the green light to a third runway.",1
"Italian police on Wednesday claimed to have smashed an international Mafia drug ring that operated inside a convent in the center of Milan, without the knowledge of the nuns who live there. According to local media reports, after a three-year investigation, paramilitary Carabinieri police on Wednesday seized 30 kilograms of cocaine, arrested 33 people across northern Italy and placed another 80 under investigation. The convent's janitor, an unidentified South American with alleged links to the Colombian cartels and the 'Ndrangheta, the Mafia of Calabria region in southern Italy, was the suspected linchpin of the organization. The man was accused of arranging 'religious' journeys from South America to Italy, in which couriers posing as pilgrims hid the drug in their hand baggage. Once arrived in Milan, the cocaine was allegedly refined and cut before being redistributed in other northern cities. The police said that the nuns were completely unaware of what the convent's janitor was up to when he was arrested. In Wednesday's operation, code-named 'Hannibal,' two ' Ndrangheta drug- trafficking kingpins based in Milan were also taken into custody. They came from the small Calabrian town of San Luca, which burst onto the international crime scene in 2007 with a gangland slaying in Germany. The police said the drug runners also had a warehouse in Ghana which was allegedly set up using funds for African fisheries earmarked by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) . ",1
"1. Professional punters do not go near the Cup The 156th running of â€œthe race that stops a nationâ€, a national day of punting and good cheer, and one of the great fun days on the Australian punt-drinking calendar, is upon us. And just about every one of us will gamble upon the race, with estimates that upwards of $800m will be spent, which is rather a lot when you sit down to think about it.   Related: 'Short but good': no rain on Melbourne Cup's parade   And yet professional punters â€“ those gamblers who represent less than 1% of all gamblers because they actually â€œwinâ€ betting on horses â€“ wonâ€™t go near the Cup. There are too many horses (24) in the race, too many variables, too much â€œformâ€ both here and overseas which could mean anything. And too many of the horses are very good because they come from everywhere to run, in part down to the prestige of the race, but also due to the pot of $6.2m that is up for grabs.  2. Racing is not always romantic Jockey Michelle Payne won the race last year aboard the 100-1 outsider Prince of Penzance, the first woman in history to win the Melbourne Cup. And she was everywhere, the â€œyou-go-girlâ€ of Australian sport. Twelve months down the track, there is one woman riding in the 24-horse field, Katelyn Mallyon aboard a 50-1 shot, Assign. Payne doesnâ€™t have a ride this year for a variety of reasons, not all sexist though.  Last year Payne had barely hopped off her mount before she criticised some of the horseâ€™s owners because they didnâ€™t want to give her the ride. She sledged these people, effectively her employers, publicly, on national television, using the stage of Flemington on Cup day to vent her spleen. And whatever the merits of her argument â€“ and there were many â€“ Payne will watch from wherever she watches in part because of that. Nor will Prince of Penzance defend the title because he injured a leg early October. Itâ€™s not always a romantic game, thoroughbred horse racing.  3. The Sheikhâ€™s year? On the website of the all-powerful Godolphin Stables it says his highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum founded the company â€œas an expression of his lifelong passion for horses and racingâ€, which would be true. It certainly wouldnâ€™t be for money.  Heâ€™s the Emir of Dubai and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and would have more money than everyone combined at Flemington on Tuesday. And yet, despite his vast wealth, the Sheikh has never won the Melbourne Cup. He wants to so badly that he has five runners in this yearâ€™s race, all which will trot out in the famous royal blue of Godolphin. That elusive win may not be far away. Hartnell has one of Australiaâ€™s best jockeys in James McDonald, came second to super-horse Winx in the recent WS Cox Plate (a race turf experts say is a better marker to the Melbourne Cup than the likes of other â€œstayingâ€ races like the Caulfield Cup), and has won at the distance at Ascot in England where staying races are valued more than here. The Cupâ€™s second-favourite is Oceanographer who won the Lexus Stakes (over 2,500m) and placed third in the recent Geelong Cup (3,200m) which was won by Qewy, who is also owned, of course, by the Sheikh.  His other chances include Beautiful Romance (70-1) and Secret Number (33-1), both of whom have been fed the finest oats and pampered like horse-princelings, and could yet make this the Sheikhâ€™s year.   Related: Latest edition of Melbourne Cup set to build on last yearâ€™s publicity coup | Michael Hutak   4. Nobody really knows who will win Every tip from every â€œexpertâ€ in the land counts for nothing, and Prince of Penzance can win at 100-1 like he did last year with a form line and breeding that would put it in the category of â€œswamp donkeyâ€ against the elite blue-blooded horses bred by Godolphin.  But that doesnâ€™t usually happen. In fact 100-1 shots would win races far less than one in a hundred times. So if youâ€™re studying form and trying to pick a winner from your newspaperâ€™s form guide, try to fossick about and find horses that have been successful over the distance (3,200 metres) or thereabouts. Indeed any success from 2,000m to 3,200m and above is staying form.  Oceanographer is one that fits the bill. A last-start winner, super impressive in both the Geelong Cup and in winning the Lexus, heâ€™s low weight, which is a real bonus for Europeans, and the forecast of rain may also suit him. He should, however, be wary of Almandin, because in-form jockey Kerrin McEvoy hopped off Oceanographer to ride him. Clearly the best local chance is Hartnell. He has been set for the Melbourne Cup and the Cox Plate was just a warmup. Winx beat him soundly but that was Winxâ€™s grand final while Hartnell is set for a longer trip. He still beat a bunch of quality horses in the Cox Plate by some distance. He represents a bit of a risk at the 3,200m based on last yearâ€™s performance (in the same race) but heâ€™s in much better form now than last year â€“ and doesnâ€™t have to race Winx again. 5. Gambling is a mugâ€™s game Australians will bet an estimated $800m on this yearâ€™s Melbourne Cup, which represents 3.5% of the $23bn Australians spend on gambling per annum. Yes, $23bn, which works out at about $1,000 per man, woman and child. It seems quite a lot. And one might think that one day there may come a reckoning for the countryâ€™s greater social good given the flow of revenue from poor people (gamblers) to rich people (bookmakers), just as there is on a micro level for hundreds of thousands of families that lose houses, cars, each other, because of addiction to the punt. And therein lies a cautionary tale: if you â€œwinâ€ today you will feel euphoria. You will feel like Homer Simpson in his dream about life after robbing the Quik-E-Mart, with Marge in a bikini doing a go-go dance and Homer sucking on a cigar in a rocking chair on the steps of a giant white house. But there is one certainty about a life â€œon the puntâ€ and it is this: you will lose. Money will flow from your wallet or virtual account into whatever electronic contraption is owned by the corporate bookmaker, a super-smart computing machine running algorithms with one sole purpose in life: to fleece you of your money.

"Supreme Court Justice Slams Police For Shoot First, Think Later MentalityBy Carey Wedler The 2010 case involved Israel Leijas Jr., who had had been stopped by a Tulia, Texas, officer and informed he was wanted on a previously issued warrant. Leijas sped away, commencing a chase that reached speeds from 85 to over 100 miles per hour. As the chase began, the initial officer warned that Leijas might be intoxicated. Leijas reportedly called police multiple times from his cell phone during the chase to warn officers he had a gun and would fire at them if they attempted to capture him. Though officers planned to put spikes on the road at three different locations in an attempt to halt Leijas vehicle, Texas Department of Public Safety State Trooper Chad Mullenix wanted to shoot directly at the car to stop it. When he radioed his superior, Robert Byrd, to ask for permission, he was told to stand by until the car passed over spikes situated near an overpass where Mullenix was located. Byrd wanted to see if the spikes would effectively stop the vehicle before taking further action. Moments before the car reached the spikes, however, Mullenix began firing at the vehicle in direct defiance of Byrds orders. The car skidded into the spikes and flipped two and a half times. Though Leijas was killed in the vehicle, authorities determined he had not been killed by the crash, but by Mullenixs bullets. The officer shot six times, hitting Leijas in the upper body four times. Leijas family sued, arguing Mullenix used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Mullenix argued he was entitled to the qualified immunity often granted to public officials when they act in the line of duty. Though Mullenix initially prevailed after several court battles, in 2014, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the prior ruling. Instead, it decided Mullenix was not entitled to immunity because the immediacy of the risk Leija posed was disputable. On Monday, the Supreme Court overturned that decision, finding Mullenix entitled to immunity and therefore exonerated of his charges. In its unsigned per curiam ruling, the court said, The doctrine of police immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law, NBC reported, noting the court added its previous rulings have never said that the use of deadly force during a dangerous car chase is automatically a constitutional violation. That conclusion was likely all but decided before the case even reached the Supreme Court. The court ruled onMullenix v. Luna using only written briefings. It never heard verbal arguments or conducted a trial, which indicates a sign that a majority of the justices considered the issue so clear cut that further briefing and courtroom argument were unnecessary, NBC explained. Only one justice, Sonia Sotomayor, objected to the opinion and in doing so, indicted a philosophy that permeates police conduct in the United States. She first noted that Mullenix fired six rounds in the dark at a car traveling 85 miles per hour. He did so without any training in that tactic, against the wait order of his superior officers, and less than a second before the car hit spike strips deployed to stop it. She argued that had the majority on the court correctly interpreted the case, they would have been left with no choice but to conclude that Mullenix ignored the longstanding and well-settled Fourth Amendment rule that there must be a governmental interest not just in seizing a suspect, but in the level of force used to effectuate that seizure. Sotomayor concluded: By sanctioning a shoot first, think later approach to policing, the Court renders protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow. In spite of her captivating dissent, the Supreme Court ruling signals an ominous future for further police brutality cases brought before the nations highest court.

If he hadnt been ordered to stand down, I wouldnt have much issue with this, plus I dont think the cop is in any way prosecutable in the first place, how this one made it to the supreme court is beyond me. If Leijas hadnt called in to say he had a gun and he wasnt going 100, different story. Would prefer the officer had followed orders and not been an adrenaline charged violent maniac, but too late for that. Yes, just one more reason why EVERYBODY should derail the entire legal system by exposing the fraud that it is based upon! The next time someone goes into a courtroom, what would happen if they were to present the so-called judge with a legally binding affidavit that at no time at all would they commit nor allow others to commit any kind of fraud? You see, the entire legal system is nothing but a fraud, so they would have to just dismiss the case! What judge, if he or she was really honest and unbiased, would refuse to sign such a document?? ONLY the criminals running a scam will not guarantee you that youre not going to be cheated and back up that promise with some kind of iron clad proof or recourse for you. They will move on to easier pickings every time. Randy But Isnt that affidavit or contract also only enforceable thru that same legal system? See how it is Oh good friggin grief!! Of COURSE it wouldnt get even one inch in the criminal legal system!! But thats not the point at all, cant you see that? The whole point is to get them between the rock of do they make a promise in the courtroom that they cannot possibly keep because the ENTIRE legal system is nothing but a fraud, and the hard place of admitting that they DO intend to commit fraud upon you!! Its sort of like if someone asks you to answer yes or no to the question Do you still beat your wife?. If you say yes, then you are admitting to currently being a wife beater, and if you answer no, then you are admitting that you used to beat your wife. Either way, you will lose status in the eyes of many people for beating your wife. Unless you subscribe to certain religions where men are required to beat their wife into submission. So you have to say (if its true that is) I have never struck my wife at any time, or something like that. Randy Okay, A) I was being facetious with my reply because I didnt realize your idea was like some super serious plan, B) youre idea is f*cking retarded. The when did you stop beating your wife thing is called the loaded question fallacy. Youre presuming the person is guilty. So your master plan is to get them to sign a document BASED on a logical fallacy which apparently you dont even know to call it that. Really? Thats enough right there to just say forget it. Because thats stupid. But, since you decided to insult me Ill continue tearing down your absolutely ridiculous, non-starter of a terrible infantile idea to shreds. Just because. How about procedure. Have you researched this? At what point should you submit it? And so on. You cant just invent a document and force a judge to sign it or throw the case out. It just doesnt work that way. You have no power to do that. Doesnt matter what it says it asks, thats insane. I dont know how else to put it. You have zero power to force the judge to sign an autograph much less a document. Then, finally, theres the fact that every judge, and lawyer too, they ALREADY have to expressly promise that they wont commit fraud, or any crime, in the course of their duties. Like a witness swears an oath, they more or less take an oath to even attain their positions. I believe theres an extra layer of oaths for a judge. If they do commit fraud, they get disbarred. If its bad enough, and its proven, they go to jail. Think of the one in Pennsylvania, taking kickbacks from a private prison. Many many years. But wait, how does a criminal go to jail if the entire system is based on fraud? No, it may not work very well, in fact it barely works at all for us non-millionaires. But the system is BASED on being a neutral arbiter of facts- tacitly speaking, fraud-free. And if the other side or the judge DOES commit fraud, you have to prove it anyway, even IF they signed your dumb document. Making it irrelevant, on top of useless, on top of nonsensical, on top of duplicative. And as far as being in the matrix, wow- Im not defending the system, Im just aware of how it actually works. You, however, might want to get out of the fantasy world where you can overcome this system and all the power it has with a piece of paper and a loaded question. Yeah, well DUH!! Of course its a loaded question, thats the whole point of it. Its loaded because its easy for anyone who is willing to look, to see the facts for themselves, that the legal system operators are all criminals ripping people off! And they ARE all guilty of committing fraud upon the court! Ever heard of that legal phrase before? Look it up sometime. Youre either a lieyer, some kind of shill/troll or an apologist for the totally corrupted legal system. Maybe all four! You need to read my treatise The Scam of the Legal System sometime, or The Holes in the Legal System. WHERE is the logical fallacy? Have you ever read The Seven Elements of Jurisdiction? How about the definition of the words contract or fraud in a law dictionary? And if youre really in the mood for an education in law, read The Maxims of Law sometime. My deceased friend Kent told me several years ago about a lieyer he had known, who won every single case he ever took on by just getting them dismissed! How did he do it? All hed do is see which maxims of law were being violated, point them out to the so-called judge, and that would be that! But Im sure youll say thats impossible, without explaining why. Let me tell you this right now, the legal system CANNOT and MUST NOT be exposed as violating its own rules, regulations and procedures. If it does, then their fraud is exposed and it stands completely naked. From WHERE does our obligation to be defrauded come from?? If we have no obligation to endure someones fraud, then we are IMMUNE from it. Savvy? From where do you get that crap about the maggots in the legal system having already promised that they will not commit fraud? Talk about total delusions! Ever read section 14 of the Corpus Juris Secondum, where it talks about the relationship between the attorney and the client? Yeah, tell me that theres no fraud at all going on there, Bub. These so-called judges NEVER swear a proper oath of office, so theyre committing fraud before they hear even their very first case! The system is NOT based upon some noble, but false idea of being a neutral arbiter of facts! If it was, inconvenient evidence would never be suppressed at trial. Jury nullification would be a perfectly acceptable means for people to be found innocent, Mr. Perry Mason wannabe. I dont have to prove fraud was committed except by merely showing that it happened! Again, your ignorance of the meaning of the word fraud shows just how little you really do know about law. Think about this now; ANY alleged contract can be vacated for fraud, threat, duress, coercion, mistake, illegality, impossibility, insanity, immorality or minority of age. If even just ONE of the five essential elements of a contract are violated, to any degree at all, then the whole thing is void ab initio. Randy shoot first, think later (we should say nerver) is a US mentality. See what dummy Obombomb do! Dont get to excited. If it had been a fed shed have ruled the other way. ",0
"The perceived crises at the two Manchester clubs should give the EFL Cup tie at Old Trafford on Wednesday considerable edge. Even so, the game is unlikely to match the drama, intensity and noise of the previous League Cup meetings between the sides. All four, from 1969 to 2010, have gone into Manchester derby folklore. The first, a semi-final played in December 1969, was a meeting of the holy trinities: Colin Bell, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee for City, George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law for United. Five of the six scored in the two-leg tie and the other, Best, was heavily involved throughout. Both teams were 18 months past their triumphant peak, when City won the league and United the European Cup, but delved into the muscle memory bank to produce a pair of end-to-end epics.   Related: Manchester United 3-1 Manchester City (4-3 on agg) | Carling Cup semi   City won the first leg 2-1 at Maine Road, with Lee earning and scoring a late penalty. Even members of the clergy were captivated. â€œOne esteemed member of the cloth, who usually does not express his feelings in such worldly fashion, observed that it was â€˜a helluva gameâ€™,â€ wrote Eric Todd in his Guardian report. â€œNobody would argue with the revered gentlemanâ€™s assessment.â€ A few, all wearing red shirts, argued with the penalty decision. Best, who was also aggrieved at being booked, knocked the ball out of the referee Jack Taylorâ€™s hands after the final whistle. The gesture was either playful or petulant, depending on whose story you believe. Taylor included it in his report and Best was banned for four weeks. He was so affronted by the punishment that, when he returned against Northampton in the FA Cup, he scored six in an 8-2 win. Best was not banned until a couple of weeks after the second leg at Old Trafford. Unitedâ€™s 2-1 lead meant it was 3-3 on aggregate when, with eight minutes to go, City were awarded an indirect free-kick just outside the area. Lee took a shot at goal anyway, possibly hoping for a deflection, and the goalkeeper Alex Stepney palmed it out for Summerbee to score the decisive goal. It was only when he later saw the highlights of the match on TV that Stepney realised it was an indirect free-kick, and he should have let Leeâ€™s shot go straight into the net. City beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 in the final.    Manchester Cityâ€™s Mike Summerbee scores the winner on aggregate past Alex Stepney in the 1969 semi-final second leg at Old Trafford. Photograph: PA Archive   The derbies around that time were dominated by City â€“ particularly at Old Trafford, where they won six out of seven league matches between 1968 and 1974. The last of those was the famous match in which they symbolically â€“ if not actually â€“ relegated United, the Lawman beating up the wrong guys and all that. Almost six months later, City returned to Old Trafford in the League Cup as huge favourites. United were going well in the Second Division, which they would win comfortably, and Old Trafford bristled with the unique defiance that is evident when a superpower are underdogs on their own ground. Arthur Albiston, 17, made a famous debut at left-back and United won 1-0 through a disputed penalty from Gerry Daly, the underweight midfielder whose spot-kick record at United is better than those of Eric Cantona and Ruud van Nistelrooy. In The Red Army Years, Richard Kurtâ€™s majestic book about United in the 1970s, one United supporter says the noise compared with famous wins over Ajax in 1976 and Barcelona in 1984 â€œas the greatest, most unbelievably exciting atmosphere Iâ€™ve ever seen Old Trafford generateâ€. City fans get just as misty-eyed about the rematch a year later, for more than one reason. They trounced Tommy Dochertyâ€™s young side 4-0, with Dennis Tueart scoring the first goal after 35 seconds and Asa Hartford at the centre of some coruscating football. This paper said it was their â€œbest performance for yearsâ€. Yet the match is most remembered for the injury that effectively ended the career of the elegant Bell, one of the best and most popular players City have ever had, when his studs got stuck in the turf as he was tackled by Martin Buchan. â€œIt felt like my leg had been screwed into the ground,â€ said Bell in his autobiography, Reluctant Hero. â€œMy knee bent backwards, bursting blood vessels in the bottom of my thigh and in the top of my calf. All the ligaments in my knee were torn. Within seconds the knee was just a bag of blood.â€ Buchan has been demonised by City fans ever since but most neutrals felt he did little wrong. â€œI donâ€™t blame Martin Buchan for the injury,â€ Bell said. â€œThere were players in the game who set out to kick and injure you but I donâ€™t think Martin was that type.â€ As in 1969-70, City went on to win the League Cup after beating United. It was their last trophy until the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover in 2008. A year later, after a deranged 4-3 win at Old Trafford, a triumphant Sir Alex Ferguson said City were â€œnoisy neighboursâ€. United wanted to keep them quiet for as long as possible, and they just about did so in an immense semi-final later that season. City won the home leg 2-1, with Carlos Tevez scoring two goals against his old club and introducing a new word to the football lexicon: after a touchline dispute with the substitute Gary Neville, he called Neville a â€œsocksuckerâ€ in a radio interview. Tevez scored again at Old Trafford with a brilliant flick, and the score was 3-3 on aggregate when Wayne Rooney headed the winner in the second minute of stoppage time. Rooney was in the form of his life, at the start of a spell of 18 goals in 13 games before injury at Bayern Munich set his career on a different path. His goal was one of three injury-time winners for United against City that season, a spectacular way to delay the inevitable change in Manchesterâ€™s balance of power. City beat United a year later in the FA Cup semi-final, en route to their first trophy since 1976. That was one of the most significant matches in Manchester football history; but when it comes to knockout competitions, it is the League Cup that has provided most of the classics.",1
"The pound is worth less than â‚¬1 at airport bureaux de change, hitting holidaymakers hard, sending the cost of a skiing break into the stratosphere and shrinking pension incomes for expats in Spain, but making Britain a bargain basement destination for tourists. Bureaux de change At Southend airport on Friday morning, Moneycorp was offering holidaymakers â‚¬0.97 for each Â£1, while at Heathrow and Birmingham airport, the best on offer was just a smidgen over parity with the euro, at â‚¬1.004. In November 2015, the peak market rate for sterling was â‚¬1.425 to the pound; although holidaymakers would not have enjoyed such a rate, spending abroad is now costing Britons 15-20% more than before the Brexit vote. Pensioners abroad About one-third of the 300,000 British people living in Spain are in receipt of a UK state pension and have effectively had a large pay cut since the EU referendum. The Â£119.30 a week basic state pension was worth as much as â‚¬170 a week last year, but is now worth â‚¬133 a week.  John Hayward, a financial adviser for British residents on the Costa Blanca, based in JÃ¡vea, said: â€œItâ€™s not all doom and gloom. The pound is down a lot, but the value of their investments have gone up as the stock market has soared since Brexit. You are not hearing too much moaning down at the bowls club. Itâ€™s still much better than 2009, when both sterling and the stock market were down.â€ However, he said it was inevitable that sterlingâ€™s plunge would have derailed plans for some retirees, with the cost of buying a property in Spain jumping significantly in sterling terms since the Brexit vote. Skiing holidays Even before the flash crash on Friday, the price of skiing holidays, especially to the US, had become fantastically expensive. A weekâ€™s ski pass in the Rocky Mountains resort of Vail now costs British visitors Â£609, with ski hire another Â£200.  Diane Palumbo of holiday operator SkiWorld said there had been a remarkable surge in canny skiers buying their lift passes and package holidays for the 2016-17 season ahead of the EU referendum. Since the decline in the pound, there has been a rise in skiers opting for all-inclusive chalet holidays where costs are controlled, Palumbo said, although there is little evidence yet that British people are abandoning traditionally popular resorts such as Val dâ€™IsÃ¨re in favour of cheaper breaks in Bulgaria. â€œThe volumes are still there, but over the longer term, we will see people looking at prices and saying â€˜maybe we will stay away from skiing for a yearâ€™. But the truth is that the ski market dropped 25% in 2008 and hasnâ€™t recovered a lot since then, and what you have now are the people who really love skiing and wonâ€™t be put off by the currency,â€ she said. Tourists to Britain Prices on Oxford Street in London and Princes Street in Edinburgh are so low that foreigners, particularly wealthy Chinese shoppers, are flocking to the UK to pick up bargains.  This week is Chinaâ€™s â€œgolden weekâ€ holiday season, and online travel site Ctrip is predicting a 40-60% increase in trips to Britain. Goods in the UK are now about 20% cheaper for Chinese buyers than a year ago and more than half of Ctripâ€™s routes to the UK were booked up one month ahead of golden week.  Britain has become the number one destination for golden week travellers to western Europe and has even elbowed aside Australia, traditionally more popular because of its proximity.  Shares in luxury goods brands have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Brexit vote, with Burberry soaring from Â£10.40 a share just before the EU referendum on 23 June to nearly Â£15, adding about Â£2bn to the market value of the company.

"Genetically Modified Grass Kills Cattle By Producing Warfare Chemical CyanideAnthony Gucciardi Just east of Austin, the cows lived on an 80-acre ranch owned by Jerry Abel. Abel says that the fields were used for over 15 years for cattle grazing and hay, and that the genetically modified grass was tested previously and should have been perfect. The GM grass however, known as Tifton 85, appears have been producing toxic cyanide. The 18 cattle went off to enjoy some fresh new genetically modified grass, when Abel says they went into a fit of convulsions and shrieks. He explains: Within 15 hours of this incident, all of the cattle had died as a result of the grass suddenly producing cyanide and therefore throwing them into a lethal fit. According to USDA scientists, it may be the result of a mutation the same kind of mutation that has been seen in many of Monsantos Roundup-Ready crops. Whats more is the fact that many other farmers are now testing their grounds and also finding the presence of cyanide. While there is not yet a large number of reports concerning cattle deaths from cyanide, it was recently revealed that one large biotech company Syngenta had been covering up further animal deaths from genetically modified corn.

"In an effort to cater toward customers seeking a slightly less revolting bus-riding experience, transportation giant Greyhound announced Thursday it is now offering its passengers premium upgrades to marginally less disgusting seats. Officials from the bus carrier confirmed that all 1,200 active vehicles in the Greyhound fleet have been outfitted with a limited number of More Tolerable seats featuring considerably fewer sweat stains and troubling damp patches on the upholstery, as well as increased legroom due to a reduction in garbage piled on the floor. With our new More Tolerable premium option, customers will enjoy a level of comfort and luxury never before experienced on our bus lines, said Greyhound CEO David Leach, noting that the first four rows of each coach will now boast such amenities as seat backs with just a few cigarette burns and plastic armrests only partially coated with an unidentifiable brown tacky substance. Exclusive perks include window casings virtually clear of crusted bodily fluids and footwells with substantially fewer crumpled-up Wendys bags. Now, our riders can reach their preferred destination while experiencing the very best Greyhound has to offer, Leach added. According to company representatives, for an extra $12.50, customers will be able to enjoy wall panels with a maximum of three hardened patches of chewing gum containing several matted strands of human hair. The upgrade also reportedly guarantees that the netted pocket on the seat in front of a rider will not be entirely filled with used tissues and yellowed racing forms. In addition, sources confirmed, the More Tolerable seating on each of Greyhounds 122 regular and express routes will be treated with powerful industrial fragrances twice a year to mask the accumulated smells of thousands of cross-country passengers and the various food items and dipping sauces they have ground into the seat fabric. With the upgrade, a customer on an overnight trip from Fort Wayne to Little Rock can just kick back and relax to the sounds of the road and, at most, one Gatorade bottle full of expectorated chewing tobacco rolling up and down the aisle, said Leach, boasting that premium seats recline easily and only on occasion malfunction in such a way that a riders chair back falls into the lap of whomever is sitting behind them. Meanwhile, the brightness level on the shared TV screen will now be turned down just enough for passengers to make out most of the scenes from the movie Cop And A Half, assuming the monitor hasnt shorted out. Leach also stated that premium seat occupants will be the carriers first riders allowed to enjoy small breaths of fresh air, having access to windows that can be opened up to half an inch. At the same time, he said, the overhead air conditioner vent that cannot be closed will now be freely adjustable between high and medium-high settings. And in what is being touted as one of the most attractive features of the upgrade, those in More Tolerable rows will reportedly be granted early boarding privileges, allowing them to enter the bus without having to maneuver around any mentally ill, intoxicated, or morbidly obese passengers blocking the narrow aisle. When I heard the special seats would have only a few rusty upholstery tacks poking out from the seat cushion into the back of my legs, I reserved one immediately, said George Maynard, a Bismarck, ND resident planning a trip to Chicago. Sure, its a little more expensive, but I couldnt say no to a window seat where the curtain has just one or two streaks of what is either human blood or strawberry-kiwi MD 20/20. Itll be nice to travel in comfort, he added. I cant wait to treat myself to the 18-hour trip. ",0
"Boston Bombing Suspects Aunt IDs Naked/Alive Detainee as Slain Nephew - FBI LiesRussia warned FBI of suspects AGAIN just 6 MONTHS ago, after repeated visits to US-backed Chechen terrorists. Independent investigative journalist Dan Dicks of Press For Truth produced a video detailing his interview with the Boston bombing suspects aunt where she identifies a naked, cuffed, clearly alive and well detainee seen in video aired by CNN, as her nephew and Boston bombing suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev would later be announced dead, with injuries covering his body from head to toe. The aunt is reportedly in fear for her life. As an increasing number of inconsistencies and outright lies accumulate regarding the FBIs handling of the case, protection must be provided to the suspects family. Members of the alternative media with the resources and the ability to provide protective watch over family members, seems a prudent measure to both protect innocent lives and to further pursue the truth. The FBI Has Now Lied Big, TWICE The FBI originally feigned ignorance over the identity of the two Boston bombing suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as they appealed to an unwitting public to help them identify and find the suspects. The Tsarnaev brothers family, immediately after their identities were confirmed by Boston police and the FBI, claimed that the FBI had contacted the suspects years ago and had monitored their activity for years since. The mother of the suspects claimed to Russia Today that her sons were set up by the FBI. Russia Today, in an article titled, They were set up, FBI followed them for years- Tsarnaevs mother to RT, stated of the suspects mother: But her biggest suspicion surrounding the case was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over the years. She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire family, the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist act. They used to come [to our] home, they used to talk to methey were telling me that he [the older, 26-y/o Tamerlan] was really an extremist leader and that they were afraid of him. They told me whatever information he is getting, he gets from these extremist sites they were controlling him, they were controlling his every stepand now they say that this is a terrorist act! Never ever is this true, my sons are innocent! Additionally, the suspects uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, told NBC news in an article titled, Uncle: Mentors radicalized older Boston bombing suspect, that: I strongly believe they were just puppets and executors of something of bigger scale. There certainly were mentors. I was shocked when I heard his words, his phrases, when every other word he starts sticking in words of God. I question what hes doing for work, (and) he claimed he would just put everything in the will of God. It was a big concern to me. He called me confused when I started explaining to him, make yourself useful to yourself and to your family and maybe youll have extra to share with everybody else. It wasnt devotion, it was something, as its called, being radicalized. Not understanding what he is talking (about). He is just using words for the sake of the words and not understanding the meaning of it. CBS would report that the FBI would initially deny having any prior contact with the suspects. In their report, CBS News: FBI Interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev 2 Years Ago, CBS claimed: CBS News reports although the FBI initially denied contacting Tsarnaev, the brothers mother said they had in an interview with Russia Today. The FBI would then be forced to concede that indeed it had interviewed the suspects, in 2011, two years before the Boston bombings. Finally disclosed on April 19, 2013 in an official statement that can be found on FBI.gov the FBI would state: The two individuals believed to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings on Monday have been positively identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, now deceased, and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, now in custody. These individuals are brothers and residents of Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a legal permanent resident and Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Charges have not yet been filed against Dzhokar Tsarnaev and he is presumed innocent. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, age 26, was previously designated as Suspect 1, wearing a black hat. Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev, age 19, was designated as Suspect 2, wearing a white hat. Both were born in Kyrgyzstan. Once the FBI learned the identities of the two brothers today, the FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011, a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the countrys region to join unspecified underground groups. In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members. The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011. The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government. However, the case was not closed, as the FBI claims. It is now revealed that the foreign government that asked the FBI for information on Tamerlan Tsarnaev was Russia, and that Russia again contacted the FBI 6 months ago after the suspect traveled to Russias Caucasus region and was apparently in contact with terrorists, long-revealed to be supported, funded, and coddled by the US. The British Daily Mail in their article titled, Russia asked FBI to investigate bomber just 6 MONTHS ago after being spotted with a militant on trip to Dagestan: Was it this known terrorist who Boston killer liked on YouTube?, would state: Speculation is growing that one of the Boston bombers met a known Jihadist terrorist in 2011 as it emerged the FBI failed to follow up on a Russian tip that he was seen with an Islamic militant six times. The Daily Mail would also report that: The FBI has confirmed that Russia alerted the agency in 2011 that Tsarnaev had ties to radical Islam groups in his homeland. Homeland Security sources have also revealed the agency received tips in 2012 about his ties to extremists connected to a Boston mosque. The FBI is confirmed to be serial liars engaged in a coverup, revealing information about its long-standing relationship with the Boston bombing suspects only when cornered by a mounting body of evidence. Its inconceivable, then, that the US government and the American public have entrusted the investigation of the Boston bombings to the FBI who is clearly obstructing justice. Now more than ever, crowd-sourced investigation must be conducted into photographs and video that may reveal the true events that transpired before and after the Boston Marathon bombings. Journalists across the alternative media must interview and draw public attention to the suspects family in order to protect them and bring to light any information that may reveal the true nature of the increasingly suspicious relationship the FBI had with the suspects for years prior to the bombings. Saving the Ship Establishment Using Double Agents, Islamophobia to Seal Off Compromised Operation Already the establishment, like a ship striking an iceberg and taking on water, is racing around to compartmentalize and seal off each agency and political faction involved to keep the rest of the establishment afloat. The FBIs attempt to feign ignorance has failed, and it appears that at least Israeli sources are trying to prepare ahead of time for revelations that may indeed reveal the suspects were working directly for the FBI. Israels Debka proposes in their report, The Tsarnaev brothers were double agents who decoyed US into terror trap, that: The conclusion reached by debka files counterterrorism and intelligence sources is that the brothers were double agents, hired by US and Saudi intelligence to penetrate the Wahhabi jihadist networks which, helped by Saudi financial institutions, had spread across the restive Russian Caucasian. Instead, the two former Chechens betrayed their mission and went secretly over to the radical Islamist networks. A more likely explanation, however, is that the FBI led the suspects along in yet another manufactured terror attack that was allowed to go live. The FBI has an extensive history (see: NYT: FBI Hatches Terror Plots) of not only providing targets with weapons, explosives, vehicles and plans engineered from start to finish by undercover FBI agents, but has also allowed these operations to go live, as was seen in New York City in 1993 during the World Trade Center bombing. FBI agents, according to the New York Times, were indeed overseeing the bombers that detonated a device killing six and wounding many more at the World Trade Center. In their article, Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast, NYT reported: Law-enforcement officials were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an informer said after the blast. The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used, the informer said. The account, which is given in the transcript of hundreds of hours of tape recordings Mr. Salem secretly made of his talks with law-enforcement agents, portrays the authorities as in a far better position than previously known to foil the Feb. 26 bombing of New York Citys tallest towers. The explosion left six people dead, more than 1,000 injured and damages in excess of half a billion dollars. Debka is attempting to preempt what would essentially be the revealing of the US-Saudi-Israeli international false-flag/terror racket, used to perpetuate a global hegemonic war that has produced for all those involved trillions of dollars in profits and unprecedented geopolitical preeminence. Operations where this true axis of terror is currently running, such as the ongoing sectarian bloodbath in Syria, would be endangered, if not entirely foiled, should the Boston bombings be traced directly back to an FBI false-flag operation. Failing to spin the FBIs involvement as either an intelligence failure or explained away by double agents, the faux-right is preparing to pry off the the entire faux-left, using its Islamophobia-racket to play out the Obama the Muslim narrative (see: Obama the Muslim: Ploy to Cover-up Years of US-Al Qaeda Support). By doing so, at least half of the establishments ship will remain afloat in the wake of revelations the US killed and horribly maimed its own citizens in a false flag operation. While Americas political establishment appears to be divided neatly into left and right camps, in reality, a singular corporate-financier oligarchy runs a singular agenda, compartmentalized for just these sort of situations. Lies regarding weapons of mass destruction and a horrific 10-year war that left millions dead, maimed, displaced or otherwise affected, can be jettisoned with the Bush Administration. And while the arming and funding of Al Qaeda occurred throughout the Bush Administration, it appears that the establishment is preparing to jettison US support for Al Qaeda with the Obama Administration. It is essential to understand and identify the corporate-financier interests that rise above partisan politics and have profited from the continued War on Terror under both the Bush and Obama Administrations. It is then essential to understand the key to undermining and ultimately throwing off this insidious co-opt of America, its people, and its destiny, is to boycott and replace permanently with local alternatives, the corporate-financier interests behind it.

"The Coalition plans to introduce electronic voting to the House of Representatives.  Conservative MP Kevin Andrews raised the idea in the Coalition party room on Tuesday and Christopher Pyne, the leader of the house, will now bring a submission to cabinet. The plan follows a report from the procedures committee, released in May this year, called â€œDivision required? Electronic voting in the House of Representatives.â€ The report recommended Australiaâ€™s parliament should be brought into line with other parliaments, including the US Congress.    Related: Malcolm Turnbull says there is 'no chance' of Coalition watering down gun laws â€“ question time live   It said electronic voting would make divisions more transparent, particularly with some form of digital display panel within the chamber that would be visible from the galleries and instantly display how members voted. It said electronic voting would save time. Just 2% of the houseâ€™s time was spent on divisions in 2015, but the largest proportion of that time was spent counting the divisions (1.3% of the Houseâ€™s time). Counting divisions is where the most time could be saved. The committee said if electronic voting was adopted, the house should retain the following:  Members may vote only from within the chamber and all members must remain in the chamber until the result of the division is announced. The house must maintain the tradition of physically dividing to the left and right of the chair. It is important for members to display their vote to other members in the chamber, and to the public observing proceedings, and maintaining this traditional practice is the most immediate and transparent method of doing so. Members may sit anywhere on the side of the chamber corresponding to their vote. Tellers continue to be appointed to report proxy votes for nursing mothers, and to be ready to undertake a manual count in the event that the voting system malfunctioned.  The committee said electronic votes should only be taken after the bells had stopped ringing, the doors to the chamber had been locked, and the question before the house had been restated by the chair. The report said a portable voting method, or systems where several members could activate the same card reader to record a vote, were the more reasonable technology options. The committee received no negative feedback from members opposed to the introduction of electronic voting. Over coming months the government will investigate the best model to implement in the chamber.",1
"STEPANAKERT, Azerbaijan â€”  The old soldiers spilled out of buses into a square, fired up by a desire to fight, and to die if necessary, in a new war with an old enemy: the Azerbaijanis.The arrival on Monday of hundreds of Armenian volunteers in Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, was just one sign of old animosities blazing anew as the latest fighting entered its third day.â€œI think this is war,â€ Lev Gevorkyan, 67, a farmer and a veteran of the last conflict, said while stepping off a bus that brought the volunteers from Armenia to this city, Nagorno-Karabakhâ€™s capital.â€œThis land was never Azerbaijan,â€ he said. â€œAnd by the way, Azerbaijan is not even a country.â€In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, the defense minister, Zakir Gasanov, issued a statement threatening to begin a military assault on Stepanakert if Armenian forces continued what he characterized as shelling of residential areas.The statement, posted on the ministry website, said the defense minister had put all units of the army on alert and warned that they would inflict â€œcrushing blowsâ€ on this city.Amid this worrying spiral of escalation in a conflict many people outside this region had long ago forgotten, as it was overshadowed by conflicts in the Middle East and in other parts of the old Soviet Union, Russia announced an offer to mediate.The Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, will travel to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, on Thursday, while the foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, is expected in Baku the same day.â€œThe situation makes us deeply concerned,â€ Dmitri S. Peskov, the Russian presidential spokesman, told reporters on Monday, according to the Interfax news agency.Ethnic tensions have long divided predominantly Christian Armenia and mostly Muslim Azerbaijan, and war between them erupted as the Soviet Union fell. The dispute has continued to simmer since a 1994 cease-fire, with occasional flare-ups of violence. It is one of at least five so-called frozen conflicts in former Soviet lands, where wars ended with cease-fires but no final settlements, the most recent in eastern Ukraine. As is usual, each side here accused the other of starting the latest fighting, this time by unleashing heavy weapons.On Monday, Azerbaijan announced that three more soldiers had died, and the Nagorno Karabakh army raised its death toll by two, without specifying when the deaths occurred.Also on Monday, five Armenian volunteers were killed when their bus was hit by an Azerbaijani drone, a spokesman for the Karabakh military said.Including at least four civilian deaths and the volunteers, the death toll on both sides rose Monday to 44 after three days. In addition, a Karabakh military official said 26 Armenian soldiers were missing in action.The Kremlin has presented itself as a mediator between the two, while also selling arms to both. Russia also maintains a small base in Armenia.On Monday, David K. Babayan, a spokesman for the president of the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, directly accused the other regional power in the South Caucasus, Turkey, of stoking the violence. Mr. Babayan told journalists that â€œAzerbaijan could not have taken this decision on its own.â€The Turkish government had no direct comment on Monday, but over the weekend, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey issued a statement saying, â€œWe pray our Azerbaijani brothers will prevail in these clashes.â€Azerbaijan declared a unilateral cease-fire on Sunday, but the fighting continued and Armenia dismissed the declaration as a trick.Azerbaijan said it would consolidate control over some strategic heights captured over the weekend in northeastern Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh officials had said no truce could come before the return of these areas.",1
"Be Powerful! Support The Change You Want to See In The World!Award-winning journalist Ben Swann travels the globe on a quest to uncover personal stories of struggle and success from people who are working to advance the betterment of the human condition There are uprisings, demonstrations and public calls to action happening this very moment that are underreported or completely ignored by institutionalized media. In this series, Ben Swann and Jasmine Monroig give voice to activists from these movements and others, who are creating change in the NEW global protest movement. Protests are only a small part of the activist movement building across the globe. Activism involves art, culture, organization, information and education. Styled after embedded journalism, we take you through a process of understanding how and why movements across the world are demanding reform and change from banking, government, policing and political powers. We will reveal activist movements that are just beginning, others that have succeeded and still others that have failed. We delve into the background of these movements, the people who are organizing them and the protesters who are calling for change, as we explore what that change looks like. In the end bringing about positive change for the betterment of mankind means facing reality. The reality of the situation is that the human race has devolved to the point of no return.The vast majority are no longer capable of any positive growth or change. Yes it was others who initiated this grand scheme, their great work of ages which initiated the downfall. But the human race was all too willing to play along and do whatever it took to bring about their own demise. So in the end it will do no good to only remove the so called powers that be to put it simply. For as a whole humanity will only continue this vicious cycle all on its own and would rabbidly resist any change. It is only once ALL are removed who are beyond redemption that any positive change can be made. This means the zombies also known as the human race itself must be eradicated, all the deviants, all the reprobates. There are only a extremely rare few now capable of sane, logical, and productive existence and are even willing to give up that chance at life if that is what it cost to take out the trash and end this nonsense once and for all. If this statement offends you in the least it is because you are too cowardly to face reality, your self, and the fact you are the part of the problem. You sound less than optimistic that there will be change for the better. I see a slow and small (r)evolution taking place around the world. To use the current cliche: People are waking up. Just like the elite has been working to change society for the worse, those interested and alert to this CAN change it for the better: Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have found that when just 10 percent of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of the society. The scientists, who are members of the Social Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center (SCNARC) at Rensselaer, used computational and analytical methods to discover the tipping point where a minority belief becomes the majority opinion. The finding has implications for the study and influence of societal interactions ranging from the spread of innovations to the movement of political ideals. When the number of committed opinion holders is below 10 percent, there is no visible progress in the spread of ideas. It would literally take the amount of time comparable to the age of the universe for this size group to reach the majority, said SCNARC Director Boleslaw Szymanski, the Claire and Roland Schmitt Distinguished Professor at Rensselaer. Once that number grows above 10 percent, the idea spreads like flame. An important aspect of the finding is that the percent of committed opinion holders required to shift majority opinion does not change significantly regardless of the type of network in which the opinion holders are working. In other words, the percentage of committed opinion holders required to influence a society remains at approximately 10 percent, regardless of how or where that opinion starts and spreads in the society. http://phys.org/news/2011-07-minority-scientists-ideas.html Maybe you should read my comment again, especially the beginning. Regardless of how many may think they are awakening all but an extremely rare few are even capable of any meaningful comprehension which you just helped to make apparent. It would be nice if there was any where near 10 percent of the human species still capable of any progress in any manner but the fact is 99.999999999999999999999999999 percent of the human race is corrupt beyond repair. By the way there is actually great cause to be optimistic knowing the destruction of this failed species is very near. This planet called earth is no longer able to support human life as it is now and the situation is made worse by the day. You could take yourself out of the equation, make it easier on you and he folks trying to institute positive change. Lets not tip him over the edge, though. No, all this constant whining and avoidance of reality only confirms what Ive said and is actually amusing in its predictability. Have fun bringing yourselves down. I have done my part and will move on. Insisting things can get better isnt avoiding reality anymore than saying everythings hopeless is facing it. If you want to keep on following me around like a troll and try to criticize what I say you should at the very least try and actually understand what it is Ive said. The only thing I said is unable to make any progress is the human race itself. I referred to mankind as being hopeless, nothing else. The human race is certainly not everything. Of course most are unable to see past themselves to realize the bigger picture and realize that the human species is just a miniscule part of the greater whole. It goes without saying that such egocentric views only lead to ignorance. The human race has had more than enough time and every opportunity to make even the slightest progress but instead as a whole indisputedly chose to move backwards and devolve. So let me say it one more time, there is cause for hope and to be optimistic since the self induced destruction of the human species is quite near. For it is the human race itself that stands in the way of progress. Any who deny this obvious truth are unwilling and/or unable to face reality. If any wish to add to this conversation at least do so in a intelligent manner that is constructive. Showing that you didnt comprehend what youve read and trying to put words in ones mouth does noone any good and only helps to perpetuate ignorance. Ive replied to you on a total of one other article, hardly trolling. Also, I understood exactly what you were saying. Not agreeing isnt the same thing as not understanding. You see no way out, thats on you. Guess its a convenient means of absolving yourself from making any effort to improve things. As I suggested: You are pessimistic about the human race and about the ability of human society to change Im sad for you. My analysis was based on my full comprehension of your initial post. What if the reason were here, Oppression always employs fear. The question of our time is becoming; How about this for an activist moment: Jailed for redressing a grievance with our district court judge. A Place for ISIS in UNESO, Please! If Albanian Muslims can enter Kosovo in UNESCO, then ISIS can also become a member of UNESCO UNESCO in Paris received a demand from ISIS for recognition, following Kosovo example ! Why not let ISIS that is also a Muslim non-recognized state that destroys Christian heritage in UNESCO ? The demand is signed by Europeans For Serbian Kosovo and Serbian Radical Party (leader: Seselj who was liberated from The Hague) . Albanian Muslims kidnappers of Serbian Christian culture want a place in UNESCO! The point is I have made it clear in my view that the only way things can get better is when the human race itself is taken off the playing field to put it simply. Humanity has made it painfully obvious there will be no progress. Of all the life on just this planet humans only account for a small fraction of it and only for a very brief time. Yet the human race has wrought outright death and destruction to life on this planet and even the earth itself. Earth is no longer even capable of supporting human life as a result and the situation made worse every day. Any responsible and sane entity therefor knows what need be done. If any one feels this viewpoint is wrong then by all means present your viewpoint. Not nonsense but some viable argument. I would like nothing more than to be proven wrong because it doesnt get much sadder than to see an entire race heading toward oblivion. And again, I get your view. Its self-destructive, self-defeating, entirely counterproductive, and a great way of ensuring exactly what you lament will happen, happens. If everyone thought like you, I would agree, were doomed, for nothing can survive the tyranny of resignation. Since not everyone does, there is still hope. Again, youre masking your bleak and fatalistic pessimism under a veneer of smug intellectuality. As a human, you are incapable of the scope you claim to have. Youre a part of humanity, suck it up and get used to it. Our flaws are yours, and one of those flaws is an inability to perceive beyond yourself. Your view that we have rendered the earth uninhabitable is nonsense. The earth can recover from far more than what weve done to it, and has done so in the past. However, nothing will be fixed as long as people like you pretend theres nothing that can be done. You act as nothing but a cheerleader for annihilation. Also, insulting people shows nothing save that youre a whiny, smug pessimist incapable of objectively viewing criticism. Seriously, calling me retarded is a serious retort? Only people who believe humanity has no hope are smart, and everyone else is mentally retarded? Youre showing an inability to reason past your own nose. Guess youre more stuck in your own skin than you realize. Anyhow, cry on about how its hopeless while the rest of us try and improve things. Its your right to complain, as it is my right to not agree. Time will demonstrate who does the world a greater service, those who complain that nothing can be done, or those who do something to try and help. This debate has been fun, although I generally prefer to argue with people who dont just call me stupid and tell me to re-read their argument. ",0
"Taiwanese investment in the Philippines in 2009 more than doubled to hit over US$113 million, despite the global economic downturn, according to a report by the Taipei-based Manila Economic & Cultural Office (MEC0). Ancku Taichung Corp. topped the list with a US$60 million electric arc furnace project being built in Batangas Province, followed by a US$40 million investment plan by TECO Industrial Motors & Applications Group, which produces UMID cards -- multi-purpose identification cards used in the Philippines' social service system -- MECO reported. The two companies' combined investment has far surpassed the 2008 figure of all investment from Taiwan, which totaled US$45.7 million, MECO said. Dita Angara-Mathay, MECO's director of commercial affairs, said Ancku is planning further investment of another US$100 million to build a blast furnace in the Philippines. To lure greater investment from Taiwan, four delegations from the Philippines sponsored investment seminars and took part in trade fairs in Taiwan last year, in search of more trade and investment opportunities. Mathay predicted that Taiwanese investment will again double in 2010, with more than 50 percent going to the power sector. Other Taiwanese firms that have invested in the Philippines this year include China Bond International Services for iron-ore mining in Aparri, worth US$5 million, as well as a US$2 million coal mining project by Shyi Chien Co. Ltd. in Sorsogon Province and a US$2 million plywood manufacturing plant by Tian Yuan Co. Ltd. in Butuan Province. According to Mathay, a Taiwanese footwear group is scheduled to visit the Philippines in the first half of 2010 to study the feasibility of setting up an operation in Bataan Province. The Taiwanese footwear maker are considering Bataan because of the availability of huge tracts of property and its proximity to Subic and Clark free port zones, Mathay said, adding that there is still a big possibility that a footwear cluster will be set up by Taiwan businessmen in the Philippines, depending on the willingness of the Philippine government to provide subsidies for land leases.

" Representative RaÃºl M Grijalva: â€˜Middle-of-the-road thinking has overstayed its welcomeâ€™ The future of the Democratic party begins with cleaning house at the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Without a dynamic progressive committed to a year-round 50-state strategy leading our party â€“ and a DNC staff committed to humble outreach and genuine advocacy for peoplesâ€™ needs â€“ we are doomed to repeats of 8 November .   Related: Democrats once represented the working class. Not any more | Robert Reich   Hillary Clintonâ€™s platform may have been the most progressive in American history, but the American people felt it wasnâ€™t enough to have a good plan on paper. We now have the chance to build a DNC that truly, wholeheartedly supports that platform and turns it into our partyâ€™s guiding principles. Whoever our next leader is, the middle-of-the-road thinking and donâ€™t-rock-the-boat strategies that have defined the top levels of Democratic politics have overstayed their welcome, both with the party faithful and with the country as a whole. We cannot rely on the same tired, inside-the-Beltway social media messages and stale talking points that got us here. Nor can we fall for the dangerous notion that if only sheâ€™d talked more about privatizing social security, Hillary Clinton might have won over more moderate voters. There is no evidence that such triangulation has any credibility with the American people, and our party needs to recognize that once and for all. If Donald Trumpâ€™s unusual ideology has taught us anything, itâ€™s that many of the political fights ahead of us have nothing to do with the arguments of the past 20 years. Party leaders need to recruit candidates with a genuine understanding of the issues that matter today, from economic insecurity to the future of rural America to social justice to education affordability.  We need to work with grassroots organizations to build a fresh party for the future. Just putting fresh paint on the party that lost the White House is not an option. Bakari T Sellers: â€˜We have to make a positive case to voters of colorâ€™ The Democratic party was dealt a body blow in this election. Non-college educated and non-suburban white voters â€“ especially in places along the Rust Belt â€“ have fled the Democratic party. They voted for Donald Trump in record numbers. To make matters worse, 6 million Obama voters chose to stay home as Hillary Clinton underperformed with virtually every Obama coalition demographic. The Obama coalition, we learned, is not an easily transferrable block.    Demonstrators in New York City protest Donald Trumpâ€™s election victory. Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters   Now, the soul searching begins. Some will say the party must become more progressive. Others will say we must refocus on the white voters that drove the Clinton presidency in the 90s. And yet others will say we must continue to focus on engaging and mobilizing the Obama coalition.  We must reject the false choice of having to choose between being more progressive or cultivating a populist economic message or continuing to fight for the causes of our increasingly diverse base. We have to do all the three.  We have to make a positive case to every voter of color of what we intend to do to improve their lives because simply pointing to the intolerance and bigotry of the Republican party is not enough.   The Obama â€‹â€‹coalition, we learned, is not an easily transferrable block. Now, the soul searching begins   We must reject stale conventional political wisdom and outreach strategies and embrace non-traditional candidates and alliances to move the party forward. We must own a message of economic populism that embraces not just the white working class but all workers in the economy that have been left behind and who feel like the recovery from the Great Recession has not reached them.  We must do more than commit ourselves rhetorically to reforming our criminal justice system and our immigration system. Instead, we must more fully commit ourselves to reforming both systems. We must be responsive to the voices in the country that are fighting to ensure that every life in this country is valued.  Our party is old and stale. The greatest asset we had going for us was that we saw the demographic changes in this country and elected a candidate that reflected that change and he gave us an affirmative case for change. The partyâ€™s job is to mobilize its supporters to the polls, and we failed. Now, its time to change. Zephyr Teachout: â€˜We must stand up to those who have too much powerâ€™ I love this country and I am worried about it. Thatâ€™s why I think the question cannot be â€œwhat should Democrats do to win?â€ but rather, what must we all, regardless of party, do to secure good secure middle class jobs, safe drinking water and respect for all people, regardless of race or religion.  What we must do is take on what FDR called the â€œprivileged princes â€¦ thirsting for powerâ€ who, in the late 1920s, â€œtook control over government itself. They created a new despotism ... In its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property.â€ In my race, three of the privileged princes, hedge funder Robert Mercer and venture capitalist Paul Singer and Sheldon Adelson, spent millions of dollars using populist language in attack ads against me. As FDR said: â€œI welcome their hatred.â€   Related: Donald Trump presidency a 'disaster for the planet', warn climate scientists   Demagoguery thrives when everyone is lying about power, and as Democrats â€“ as citizens â€“ we must be more honest, we must name the names of the modern princes, from Peter Thiel to Dan Loeb to Paul Singer, who are using chump change to play with local elections and national fear. We must stand up for water and stand against abuse of eminent domain, where the worst kind of corporate power teams up with governmental power to take land for dangerous fossil fuel projects.  We must stand up for unions all the time, not just before an election, stand up for prevailing wage, speak up for project labor agreements, stand up against misclassification.  We must unapologetically oppose the AT&T merger as a reckless concentration of power, and push where we can for breaking up the stranglehold of big cable, big pharma and big agriculture.  In other words, we must be honest about power, and truly stand up for those who have too little against those who have too much.  Stephanie Taylor: â€˜We must follow the lead of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warrenâ€™ When you drive through the Rust Belt states that handed Donald Trump the presidency â€“ states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â€“ you see a people in profound economic crisis. The only jobs are low-paid retail jobs at Walmart or the Dollar Store, or if you are really lucky, a job at the local hospital. The costs of healthcare and childcare are skyrocketing. Credit cards are maxed out, and college is a pipe dream. The epidemic of drug addiction is destroying whole families. Meanwhile, no one pays.   Related: Democrats must look to Nevada for hope â€“Â and lessons on how to win | D Taylor   In the foreclosure crisis 10 years ago, the banks seized millions of homes, and no one ever went to jail for it. Corporations can break laws, move their plants to China, lay everyone off and get away with it. Of course people are angry. For years, the Democrats havenâ€™t offered a counter narrative. They havenâ€™t said: â€œThese are the villains â€“ the corporations like the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, big agribusiness and telecom. And here is what weâ€™re going to do about it.â€ Democrats, by and large, havenâ€™t been willing to take on corporate power in a real way. They havenâ€™t offered a systemic critique of the rigged economy and broken system, and shown that they are willing to fight it. There are a few notable exceptions, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Now Democrats need to follow their lead â€“ or Democrats will keep losing, over and over.    The Democrats should follow the lead of Bernie Sanders and his willingness to take on corporate power. Photograph: Andy Abeyta/AP   Donald Trump played to the worst xenophobic fears of Rust Belt voters, channeling their anger against immigrants, Muslims, anyone â€œdifferentâ€ from them. But he also offered a systemic critique that sounded a lot like Warren and Sanders. Even his closing TV ad bashed the â€œfailed and corrupt political establishment ... the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals â€¦ The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobsâ€. And so he won those key midwest states. And America is worse for it. This is a moment of reckoning for the Democratic party.  Ilya Sheyman: â€˜The Democratic party canâ€™t win if it smells like corporate influenceâ€™ In February 2016, the Democratic National Committee ended its ban on donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees â€“ a policy put in place by then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008.  At last, corporate money could flow in unchecked. The Democratic party would have the resources to win up and down the ballot. Right? Wrong.  In fact, the rule change symbolized a deeper disconnect between the Democratic party and the voters it relies upon. Millions of those voters made known their outrage at business as usual via the the Bernie Sanders insurgency, to no avail. In November, millions of once-Democratic voters stayed home. The result: a catastrophic electoral rout â€“ despite a hideously despised Republican nominee.   Millions of voters made known their outrage at business as usual via the the Bernie Sanders insurgency, to no avail   Voters donâ€™t want a Democratic party that smells like corporate influence. For the Democratic party to reclaim its greatness, it must be its best self: the party of the people.  The first step is to clean house. Itâ€™s time for a leader like Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Keith Ellison, and for a return to Howard Deanâ€™s winning 50-State Strategy. The inclusive, progressive and populist agenda that emerged from last summerâ€™s Democratic convention was a great one. Itâ€™s time to pair it with a surge of investment in on-the-ground organizing and an embrace of candidates who can bring new voters and energy to the party.  Meanwhile, Democrats must stiffen their spines. They won the popular vote, after all. They have a mandate to oppose Trumpâ€™s extremist, bigoted agenda at every turn â€“ and a passionate and growing mass progressive movement on the streets demanding they do everything in their power. The sharper the contrast between Democrats and the billionaire classâ€™s billionaire president, the greater the chance for a speedy Democratic resurrection.",1
"The Taliban on Tuesday rejected an olive branch extended by Hamid Karzai, ridiculing the Afghan president as a 'puppet' of the West after he was handed another five years in power. In his first public appearance since being declared president for a second term, Karzai reached out to the Islamist militia who have waged an increasingly virulent insurgency since being toppled from power in 2001. 'We call on our Taliban brothers to come home and embrace their land,' Karzai told a news conference a day after organisers declared him the winner of the country's second presidential election. But his offer was slapped down by the Taliban. They accused Karzai of being in hock to Western powers who helped sweep him to power eight years ago and are still struggling to defeat the movement on the battlefield. The president has repeatedly appealed to the Taliban, offering an amnesty to its fugitive leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, but has made little headway in dividing the shadowy movement's ranks. 'This is not the first time Karzai has made such statements,' Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, told selfnews by telephone from an undisclosed location. 'We do not attach any value to these offers of peace by Karzai as we know they are empty words. 'He is a puppet and his government is a puppet government. He is in no position to make such decisions or stand by them.' In a statement issued in their spiritual capital Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, the Taliban said the 10-week election saga, which ended with organisers scrapping a scheduled run-off, showed the West dictated policy. 'The cancellation of the second round of the election showed that decisions on Afghanistan are made in Washington and London, while the announcements are made in Kabul,' the Taliban statement said. 'What is astonishing is two weeks ago they were arguing that the puppet president Hamid Karzai was involved in electoral fraud... but now he is elected as president based on those same fraudulent votes, Washington and London immediately send their congratulations.' The Taliban had called for a boycott of the electoral process and carried out scores of attacks in the build-up to the first round and on election day. It had also threatened to intensify attacks ahead of the run-off, carrying out a deadly attack on a guesthouse for UN workers in Kabul last week. UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who congratulated Karzai, said the mission would not be forced out of Afghanistan by violence, after Taliban gunmen stormed into a UN- approved guest house killing at least five expatriate UN staff. 'We will not be deterred, cannot be deterred and must not be deterred and the work of the United Nations will continue,' he said on a visit to Kabul. But the Taliban said Karzai could not be considered legitimate as president without winning over 50 percent of votes in the first round. 'How and based on what principles will the United Nations consider this a legal administration now that the so-called 'war on terror' and 'democracy' have been shown to be empty slogans?,' said the militia.

"Labour will continue to back the renewal of the Trident weapons system despite Jeremy Corbynâ€™s longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons, the new shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, has said. The Llanelli MP used an interview with British Forces Broadcasting to confirm she would not â€œshilly-shallyâ€ by seeking to change a policy reaffirmed by the Labour conference in 2015. A spokesman confirmed that meant not revisiting the partyâ€™s position on the issue before 2020.  â€œI think we have to look where we are, we are already committed to trident going ahead and therefore we have to back that. We canâ€™t be shilly-shallying about, a decision has been taken, that decision was actually taken back in 2007 and as I say that is an issue which we as a party have consistently voted to keep as our policy,â€ she said. Griffith added that instead of seeking to block Trident, which the House of Commons overwhelmingly backed in July, she would focus her efforts on multilateral disarmament.    Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary Photograph: John Stilwell/PA   â€œWhat we do need to do now, and there is a very strong mood for this, both within the Labour party and in the broader public, is really push forward on the multilateral nuclear disarmament, on the multilateral approach of bringing people together across the globe to try to make our world a safer place,â€ she said. Labour split three ways on the recent Trident motion, with Corbyn voting against, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and then shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, abstaining, and many Labour MPs backing renewal. Griffith took the role after Lewis was moved sideways into the business brief, following an embarrassing incident at the Labour conference where he appeared to react angrily when the wording of his speech on Trident was altered at the last minute.   Related: Itâ€™s now clear thereâ€™s a schism among Jeremy Corbynâ€™s cheerleaders | Rafael Behr   Griffithâ€™s appointment was widely seen at the time as a signal that Corbyn, who has campaigned against nuclear weapons for decades, was uncomfortable with Lewisâ€™s pledge not to alter Labour policy before the 2020 general election. But she reaffirmed the commitment Lewis made not to revisit the issue. Meanwhile, Corbyn has announced more appointments to his frontbench, including the campaigning Dewsbury MP, Paula Sherriff, as the shadow member for women and equalities, and the MP for Birmingham Northfield, Richard Burden, who will be shadow transport secretary. Sherriff coordinated a letter from more than 40 of Labourâ€™s female MPs in July, calling on Corbyn to do more to tackle â€œescalating hostility and abuseâ€ within the party. Rosie Winterton, whose sacking as chief whip angered many Labour MPs, has accepted a job as Labour party envoy to sister parties across Europe in the run-up to Brexit, including acting as Labourâ€™s representative in the Party of European Socialists, which brings together left-of-centre groups across Europe. â€œRosie has a wealth of knowledge and experience and will be a real asset in helping the Labour party develop closer links with our sister parties around the world and I am absolutely delighted that she has agreed to serve in this important role for the Labour party,â€ Corbyn said, adding that he had asked her to accompany him on a trip to meet the Party of European Socialists next week. Asked whether the seven new appointments â€“ plus Wintertonâ€™s post â€“ meant Corbynâ€™s reshuffle was finally complete, a spokesman said there would be further announcements in the days ahead, including relieving of one of his two roles, as shadow Scotland and Northern Ireland secretaries. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, travelled to the giant BAE Systems shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria this month to see the first steel cut for the new Successor submarines, which will replace the ageing Vanguard fleet. The Labour MP for Barrow and Furness, John Woodcock, sometimes a vehement critic of Corbyn, welcomed Griffithâ€™s statement. â€œThis is very welcome and sensible from the new shadow defence secretary. Nia has taken over the brief in unusual and difficult times but she will generate much good will with this pragmatic recognition that the Trident decision has been taken,â€ he said.",1

"Year after year, as executive pay continues its inexorable climb, itâ€™s amusing to watch corporate directors try to justify the piles of shareholder money they throw at the hired help. Check out any proxy filing for these arguments, which usually center on how closely and carefully the executivesâ€™ incentive compensation is tied to the performance of company operations.But pay for performance is only as good as the metrics used to determine it. And as a recent study shows, some metrics â€” including the most popular â€” are downright ineffective at motivating executives to create shareholder value.The study was done by James F. Reda, a veteran compensation consultant, and his associate David M. Schmidt, both of whom are in the human resources and compensation consulting practice at Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. They analyzed pay metrics used by 195 large companies over the five years that ended in December 2012. By comparing those measurements with moves in these companiesâ€™ stock prices, the study identified the common pay metrics that corresponded with above- or below-average performance.Their analysis will come in handy for investors examining the executive-pay tallies for 2013. As usual, the numbers are staggering: The median compensation for C.E.O.s at the 100 largest companies that have filed so far was $13.9 million, according to the Equilar 100 C.E.O. Pay Study, conducted by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm. Thatâ€™s up 9 percent from 2012.But investigating the basis of these amounts takes some digging. Consider Oracle, whose chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, received $78.4 million, placing him atop our 2013 pay list. Only by reading the companyâ€™s proxy do you learn that Oracle determined its incentive compensation â€” meaning most everything but salary â€” based on growth in what it calls â€œnon-GAAP pretax profit.â€In Oracleâ€™s lexicon, that means the companyâ€™s earnings before income taxes and minus the costs of stock-based compensation, acquisitions, restructurings and other items. In other words, the Oracle number is not based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and that makes its numbers look better.Oracleâ€™s approach is just one of many benchmarks companies can choose. Some boards award incentive pay based on a companyâ€™s total shareholder return or earnings-per-share growth; others use return on invested capital or return on equity. Most companies use more than one measure. And all argue that their methods justify the incentive pay they award.But which measurements work and which donâ€™t?According to Mr. Reda and Mr. Schmidt, stocks of companies choosing the most popular gauge â€” total shareholder return â€” as a performance metric for at least one year out of the five in the study underperformed stocks of companies using other benchmarks. By contrast, stocks of companies that used earnings-per-share measures based on generally accepted accounting principles outperformed.The analysis also determined that companies making frequent changes to their pay metrics vastly underperformed those that stuck with their benchmarks.It is dismaying that companies using total shareholder return as a performance metric tended to underperform, given its rising popularity in pay practices. Among the 195 companies in the study, just over half â€” 53 percent â€” used total shareholder return as a metric. Those companiesâ€™ shares had an average loss of 0.18 percent, annualized, over the five-year period. That compares with an average gain of 1.15 percent among all 195 stocks, regardless of the benchmark they used.Even more striking, stocks of companies that did not use total shareholder return as a measure gained an annualized average of 2.67 percent.â€œWhat this says is companies should look for alternatives to the total shareholder return measure,â€ Mr. Reda said. â€œThey should look for growth drivers that management can control and not do the knee-jerk thing.â€ That knee-jerk thing, he said, is total shareholder return, and he said that using it routinely was a mistake.Interestingly, the study found that stocks of companies using a much less popular metric â€” earnings-per-share growth â€” were more likely to outperform. Only 37 percent of companies used that measure at least once from 2008 to 2012, the study found. Still, these shares generated a gain of 1.37 percent, annualized, during the five years, above the 1.15 percent average gain across all the companies.Neither Mr. Reda nor Mr. Schmidt could say with certainty why the benchmark of total shareholder return seemed so closely linked to lackluster corporate performance. But Mr. Reda was willing to speculate on why earnings-per-share measures were less popular in the boardroom. They are harder to manipulate than other measures that burnish results by removing costs from the equation, he said. (Of course, earnings can be enhanced by stock buybacks and other management machinations, but most of those tricks can be spotted fairly easily.)â€œEarnings per share seems to be the best measure, and lots of investors and shareholders think it is important,â€ Mr. Reda said. â€œBut companies hate it. They donâ€™t want to be held accountable for the costs of discontinuing product lines or closing factories.â€Another conclusion from the study is this: Shares of companies that chose a metric and stuck with it generally did better than those of companies that changed their measures. For example, the 24 companies that changed their performance measures three times over the five years generated an average loss of 2.65 percent, annualized. The 56 companies that maintained the same metrics over the period â€” it didnâ€™t matter which metric they used â€” showed gains of 5.09 percent.â€œStability of design has value,â€ Mr. Reda said.Perhaps the studyâ€™s clearest message is that one size does not fit all when measuring pay for performance. For instance, not all companiesâ€™ stocks underperformed when their managers were judged on total shareholder returns.Health care equipment and services companies are an example. The returns of those that used total shareholder return exceeded the average returns of their peers, the study found. Of the 11 companies studied in that industry, the stocks of the three using total shareholder return generated average annualized gains of 4.4 percent in the period. That compares with 1.9 percent for shares of companies that didnâ€™t use the metric.Similarly, the use of earnings per share didnâ€™t always translate to stock outperformance, the study found. This was the case in the energy, insurance, media and retailing industries.As a result, Mr. Reda said, boards must design their pay packages with goals that are specific to the companyâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, but that will also promote the kind of growth that shareholders want.â€œLarge companies can be unwieldy,â€ Mr. Reda said. â€œIf management is not really focused on what they need to do, they are unlikely to succeed in getting their houses in order. If you can focus management on things they can control, investors might be better off.â€",1
"Even the American Medical Association (AMA) May Back Labeling of GMOsAnthony Gucciardi In an attempt to accelerate the process towards the direct labeling of GMOs,the Indiana State Medical Association and Illinois State Medical Society have both introduced resolutions to the AMA on the subject. The resolutions, which stem from these prominent mainstream entities, urge the AMA to back labeling initiatives. The AMA will reportedly be considering the proposals on June 17th, during its annual meeting. Whats more, the long list of individuals and organizations behind the push for labeling does not stop there. The resolutions submitted to the AMA are backed by a multitude of researchers and physicians, including Dr. Martha Herbert, a pediatric neurologist and past vice-chair of the Council on Responsible Genetics. In response to the secretive nature of GMOs and the subsequent lack of real knowledge on their wide scale effects, Dr. Herbert stated: Tracking the millions of people with vulnerable immune systems and their reaction to novel proteins and virus fragments in genetically engineered food is impossible without food labeling. For example, a large incidence of cancer may have erupted as a result of GMO consumption, and it may be nearly impossible to isolate the incidents and conclusively link GMOs to the onset of the disease. This is one reason why it is extremely challenging to bring down Monsanto with a lawsuit, as the company could say due to the mislabeling and allowance of GMOs into the food supply that it is impossible to prove GMOs were directly responsible. What we do know, however, is that GMOs have been linked to a number of problems for both humans and the environment. Insects like rootworms are continually becoming more and more resistant to heavy pesticide usage on GMO crops, prompting farmers to douse the crops in even more brain damage-linked pesticides. Not only does this pose a serious threat to human health, but the environment as well. Through the creation of mutated bugs that threaten farmland, Monsantos creations are changing the very way that the insects respond to chemical pesticides. As a result, warnings by the EPA and scientific groups have begun surfacing. Even mainstream medical groups are coming out of the woodwork to lend support to the labeling of GMOs. Its time that the government began responding appropriately to the overwhelming amount of support towards the many labeling campaigns and initiatives currently being launched around the globe.

"Adani has been shielded from potential legal challenges that loom for other miners under Queenslandâ€™s water-licensing reforms after last-minute changes to legislation by the Palaszczuk government. Mining projects in development will be forced to obtain a water licence under a government bid to manage impacts on groundwater use, which its predecessor tried to deregulate.  But an amendment by the government on Wednesday has exempted projects that have already been dealt with by the land court, such as Adaniâ€™s Carmichael mine, from further legal challenges to a licence.    Related: Adani's Carmichael mine granted 'unprecedented' powers, says report   However, another controversial project â€“ the New Acland mine, which is subject to a pending land court ruling â€“ will not be spared further challenges. This is despite a push from the Liberal National opposition for an amendment specifically exempting the mine, whose parent company is a major federal Liberal party donor. The opposition accused Labor of an embarrassing backdown on Adani and hypocrisy on New Acland with laws that would â€œkill off close to 700 jobsâ€. The environment minister, Steven Miles, said Labor had removed a â€œticking time bomb [in the] reckless lawsâ€ passed by the former LNP government, which were to have made unlimited groundwater freely available to miners from December. Miles said that parliament had agreed there was no benefit in courts repeating scrutiny of ground water impacts if it had already delivered a judgment after â€œexhaustive cross-examinationâ€. Adani Australiaâ€™s chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, singled out premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for thanks in providing â€œtransitional relief for Adaniâ€™s projectsâ€. â€œThe relief is based on the companyâ€™s advanced approvals status and the rigorous science-based examinations including water management that have already been undertaken,â€ Janakaraj said. â€œBy recognising an area of concern in this bill that might have opened up a new line of activist delays and addressing it, the premier and her government have been true to their word.â€  He said the company was confident of beginning construction on a $21bn coal project in 2017. A Queensland Greens spokesman, Ben Pennings, said the amendment represented â€œa midnight coup by Adaniâ€. â€œWhile Queenslanders watched [US president-elect Donald] Trumpâ€™s victory in shock, horror or celebration, the state government amended its own bill to fast-track Adaniâ€™s Reef-destroying mega-mine,â€ he said. Miles criticised the LNP for moving amendments to exempt â€œspecific projects chosen by the LNP from having to apply for and qualify for a water licenceâ€.  â€œHow did they select those projects and what undertakings did they make to those companies?â€ Hearings in a land court challenge by local landholders to New Acland have been completed but the member is yet to hand down a judgment. The Environmental Defenders Office, which has acted in land court challenges to both the Carmichael and New Acland mines, said the amendment that would benefit Adani was a concerning twist on what had otherwise been a â€œgood initiativeâ€ by the government.   Related: We should be putting the brake on the Carmichael coalmine, not hitting the accelerator | Graham Readfearn   Its chief executive, Jo Bragg, said it was â€œgravely concerning that, on the most controversial proposed coalmine in Australia, the ALP government has now moved amendments so there will be no public submissions or appeals relating to groundwaterâ€. Bragg said it was â€œa mythâ€ that the governmentâ€™s legislation would cause unfair delays to miners as it continued the longstanding need for miners to gain licences â€œsubject to public appealâ€ to use groundwater under the Water Act. â€œAdani could have lodged its application years ago,â€ she said. Tim Seelig, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the passage of Laborâ€™s water legislation was â€œthe best outcome possibleâ€ given the difficulties of passing environmental laws through Queenslandâ€™s hung parliament. The laws would enable â€œsome level of policy and legal scrutinyâ€ of water licensing processes for major mining projects, he said. â€œWe look forward to a situation in a future parliament where new mining projects are brought back under a water licensing regime with full appeal rights. â€œWe urge the government to use the powers it now has to properly test the ecological sustainability of advanced mining proposals, and to ensure proper scrutiny and capacity to challenge decisions where environmental destruction is proposed.â€",1
"Zac Goldsmith stands down in Richmond Park to protest against the Heathrow decision, just as he said he would. A man of honour keeping his promise? Thatâ€™s not how he may emerge on byelection polling day. Yet again, this spoiled nonentity is cosseted by his party: though he stands as an â€œindependentâ€, the Conservatives will try to save his bacon by setting no candidate against him, to avoid splitting their vote. That makes it harder for the Liberal Democrats to snatch back this seat â€“ but by no means unlikely, after their strong showing in Witney. There have rarely been so many good reasons for expelling an MP â€“ and Richmond Park might just do it. Start with his character. In his ill-judged London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, Goldsmith hired toxic spin-master Lynton Crosby to help him descend to the lowest anti-Muslim racism. His lacklustre performance was only memorable for his repeated smears alleging Khan had â€œgiven platforms, oxygen and even cover â€“ over and over and over again â€“ to those who seek to do our police and capital harmâ€. He invented nonexistent â€œlinksâ€ to fanatics, claiming Khan â€œrepeatedly legitimised those with extremist viewsâ€, as he wrote in the Mail on Sunday.   Related: The Richmond Park byelection is a golden opportunity to fight Brexit | Hugo Dixon   His absurd claim that Khan would be Jeremy Corbynâ€™s â€œman in Londonâ€ as a leftist puppet of his partyâ€™s leader was the normal politics: after all, Corbyn is Labour leader, later claiming Khanâ€™s victory as his own success. What was shockingly abnormal was Goldsmithâ€™s attempt to split Londonâ€™s voters along hyper-sensitive racial and religious lines. His campaign literature, sent to Indians, Tamils and Sikhs, suggested that Khan, a Muslim of Pakistani descent, would not â€œstand upâ€ for them as mayor. Farcically offensive to all communities, he even suggested Khan would raise taxes on their family jewellery, assuming gold is what motivates non-Muslims. Goldsmith repeatedly used the word â€œradicalâ€ about Khan, with clear connotations of â€œradicalisedâ€.     Zac Goldsmith resigns after governmentâ€™s go-ahead to Heathrow third runway  But he lost. London rejected him and in electing its first Muslim mayor showed it had no truck with such filth. Now Richmond Park must do the same as a lesson to any politician tempted to lever themselves up through racism. That is the prime reason why Labour MP Lisa Nandy has called for her party not to put up a candidate, giving the Lib Dems a clear run to unite all those against Goldsmith. Clive Lewis, from the Corbyn wing of Labour, and Jonathan Reynolds, from the non-Corbyn wing, join her in calling on Labour to stand back. They are right. This byelection will not be about Heathrow: all candidates will be equally opposed. It will be about Goldsmithâ€™s bad character â€“ but it will also be about the great crisis facing the country. Goldsmith, following in the footsteps of his father, who started the rabid anti-EU referendum campaign, is for a hard Brexit, wrenching us away as brutally and damagingly as possible. As the risks become real, with the pound plunging, food and petrol prices set to rise next year and damaging consequences for industry and finance beginning to emerge, polls suggest opinion is already shifting. The good growth figures announced today are only for services, while manufacturing, industry, agriculture and construction all shrank again. Controlling immigration matters to most people, but not at any economic price. If the price turns out to be too high, staying in the single market will matter more. Richmond Park voted remain by 70%, so there is no better place to make that case and surely no better candidate to beat than hard Brexiteer Goldsmith. Will Labour stand back? Not a chance. There are good reasons why Labour detests the Lib Dems for what they did in the coalition. Old rivalries locally die hard: Lib Dems often fight dirty on the ground.   Related: Labour frontbenchers urge party not to contest Richmond Park byelection   But for a host of bad old tribal reasons, the Nandy, Lewis, Reynolds idea isnâ€™t supported even by Labour MPs who say they back electoral reform and the great cultural shift proportional representation implies. Ask why not and they say, â€œItâ€™d look like a back-room stitch-upâ€, â€œWe must give voters a chance to vote Labourâ€, â€œWeâ€™d look weak if we didnâ€™t standâ€, â€œThis would set a bad precedent for other seatsâ€, â€œOur local councillors in the area wouldnâ€™t agreeâ€, â€œThe NEC wonâ€™t have itâ€ and so on. The result will be yet another humiliating hammering for Labour in a seat it could never win, but hey, never mind. Imagine instead Corbyn saying something like this: â€œThere are times when politicians should put country above party, and this is one of them. First we must show the door to the cynical racism of people like Goldsmith. Second, we must protect Britain from the ideological fanatics who want to destroy our economy by taking us out of the single market, whatever damage that does. Third, we have a rotten electoral system, with an unjust first-past-the-post system that forces tactical voting on us. â€œLet this byelection be an expression too of the need to change a system that denies people the right to form and vote for parties of their choice. We donâ€™t forgive the Liberal Democrats for their collusion in cuts that impoverished the most vulnerable and devastated public services. But there are times when it is right for a party to stand back and raise our sights to Britainâ€™s future. We call on the voters of Richmond Park to make their mark, expel a dishonourable man from politics and vote against all extreme Brexiteers who risk irreparable damage to the country.â€ Donâ€™t hold your breath. Corbyn doesnâ€™t believe in electoral reform and nor does he cleave to the single market. Though no doubt he reviles Goldsmithâ€™s racism, he doesnâ€™t detest it quite enough to lend a hand to oust him. Gentler, kinder politics doesnâ€™t mean alliances, not even progressive ones.",1

"Brent Roske lives on a 45-foot yacht off the coast of Marina del Rey, which is technically on the Pacific Ocean, but for jurisdictional purposes is considered part of the city of Los Angeles and, more to the point, the 33rd Congressional District of California. In January, Henry Waxman, the liberal stalwart who has represented the district with little resistance since the year after Roske was born, announced that he would not seek re-election. Now Roske, who is 39, is part of a field of 18 candidates hoping to represent the heartland of Beverly Hills, Malibu and Bel-Air in the United States Congress.A former creative director at NBC Universal, Roske is not without assets. He is the producer of a web series called â€œChasing the Hill,â€ which chronicles the campaign of a fictional Democratic congresswoman. He also has support from the White House â€” or at least the soundstage White House of â€œThe West Wing.â€ Richard Schiff, who played Toby on the series, has a big role in â€œChasing the Hillâ€ and is a Roske friend. So is David Hasselhoff, who played the governor of California on the web series. Should Roske get elected, he already has some bold ideas. He plans, for instance, to hire a film crew to document his every move in office. â€œPeople have a right,â€ he says, â€œto know what their elected representatives are doing.â€Roske describes Waxman as â€œan honorable man,â€ but one whose extended status in D.C. has meant that he â€œno longer really represents the people.â€ This raises the question of what it means to represent â€œthe peopleâ€ in Americaâ€™s second-wealthiest congressional district. (It trails only the 12th District of New York, which includes parts of the East Side of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.) California 33 is, after all, home to what might be the highest per capita population of political dilettantes, â€œcreative activists,â€ foreign-policy hobbyists and flush Democratic donors in the nation, not to mention large numbers of people who like to tell you about their good friends Bill and Hillary. (And how they were just talking to Bill the other day, in fact, and stay tuned for who they think Hillaryâ€™s running mate will be.)News of Waxmanâ€™s departure unleashed a kind of political anarchy on the Botox Belt. â€œWhen you represent a district for 40 years, it does tend to produce pent-up demand,â€ Waxman told me. Initially, fantasies were spun about celebrity candidates jumping into the race and vying â€œSurvivorâ€-style for the privilege of serving in the Peopleâ€™s Chamber. Roll Call, the Capitol Hill publication, put out a call via Twitter for the likes of Courteney Cox, Danny DeVito and Betty White, as well as a roster of other A-through-C-listers. Ricki Lake and Richard Simmons replied â€” to say no. Lorenzo Lamas came back with a maybe.Even so, the existing field reflects the vibrant collection of humanity that resides in California 33. Some are serious candidates, some not â€” three Republicans, three Independents, one Green, one Libertarian, the rest Democrats. Youâ€™ve most likely not heard of any of them except Marianne Williamson, the self-help guru, who dislikes being called a â€œself-help guru.â€ (Her spokesman has suggested the term â€œthought leader.â€) Williamson has spoken of turning our political dialogue into â€œa conversation of the heart.â€ Katy Perry shows up at her events, as do multiple Kardashians. Kim officially endorsed her in a blog post just before press time. Williamson also received the support of Alanis Morissette, Nicole Richie and, for added sex appeal, Dennis Kucinich.The more conventional candidates include Matt Miller, a Clinton White House alumnus and author who co-hosts a popular talk show on the public-radio station KCRW (and had a cameo appearance as a D.C. pundit in the Denzel Washington movie â€œThe Siegeâ€); and Barbara Mulvaney, a former State Department official who was the senior prosecutor for the United NationsInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Republican Elan Carr is a prosecutor and an Iraq War veteran and the president â€” or â€œSupreme Masterâ€ â€” of the Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi. (If you want a congressman who led a Hanukkah service in Saddam Husseinâ€™s former palace, he is your man.) Then there are the favorites: the former Los Angeles controller Wendy Greuel, who was the runner-up in last yearâ€™s L.A. mayorâ€™s race and is backed by Emilyâ€™s List, the political-action committee, as well as by Ed Begley Jr. and Rob Reiner; and Ted Lieu, a California state senator and lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, who emigrated from Taiwan as a child, lived in a basement apartment in Cleveland and helped his parents hawk jewelry as a child.None of them, however, are enjoying themselves as much as Brent Roske. I met him last month at a diner in West Hollywood. He ordered a meatloaf sandwich, and after a few minutes, Richard Schiff showed up. I wanted to call him Toby â€” because he is Toby, basically, self-serious, intense and irritable. A group of about a dozen schoolchildren filed into the diner for milkshakes. One had a distinctive, shrieking laugh, which kept making Schiff jump slightly in his chair. â€œI almost shot that kid right in the head,â€ he said at one point. â€œThis is why we shouldnâ€™t have a gun culture, because I would have shot him.â€Schiff has many opinions about politics, which we were obligated to hear because he once worked in a TV White House. At one point he said that people from the Obama campaign told him how much â€œThe West Wingâ€ inspired them to get into politics. I donâ€™t doubt this, as Washington is filled with operatives who routinely quote lines from the show and have come to mimic the charactersâ€™ fast-talking mannerisms and heady sense that they are always shaping history. â€œI came to the conclusion that without â€˜The West Wingâ€™ â€” â€ Schiff said, then slightly changed gears. â€œI donâ€™t think Obama â€” â€ He seemed to be struggling for a way to credit the show he was on with the Obamaâ€™s election. By contrast, todayâ€™s political productions, like â€œHouse of Cards,â€ are darker shows for darker times. Schiff joked that people probably â€œgo up to Kevin Spacey and say, youâ€™re the reason I decided not toâ€ get into politics.The opinions of people in California 33 are, of course, more valuable than those of, say, Indiana 9. Or at least they have paid for that belief. â€œPoliticians come here from all over the country and use us as an A.T.M.,â€ Wendy Greuel told me, referring to the never-ending fund-raising bazaar â€” largely for Democrats â€” that is this district. We were eating lunch at Nate â€™n Alâ€™s, the Jewish deli in Beverly Hills that is favored by studio heads and agents and claims to have the best matzo-ball soup in Los Angeles. Greuel, who went with the chili, is a former executive at DreamWorks. Being home to such a creative, famous and rich population, she suggested, entitles California 33 to special care and attention. â€œWe need to make sure that our national leaders know that if weâ€™re going to support them, they need to support us,â€ Greuel said â€” by which she seemed to suggest that someone needed to give voice to the poor and exploited citizens of fantasy land. I later mentioned this notion to Representative George Miller, a longtime Democratic congressman from Northern California who is also retiring this year. Miller chuckled. â€œThese people have more voice than anybody in America,â€ he said.Miller was elected to Congress in 1974, the same year as Waxman, as part of a Democratic wave that followed Richard Nixonâ€™s resignation that summer. The so-called Watergate babies â€” 75 new Democrats, half of them under 40 â€” came to represent a generation of reform-minded policy makers, generally liberal and collectively determined to upend the ossified traditions and sensibilities of Congress. Miller and Waxman will be the last of the true Watergate litter to leave the House. (Rick Nolan, who represented the Sixth Congressional District of Minnesota from 1975 to 1981, was elected to the Eighth in 2012.) Patrick Leahy of Vermont remains in the Senate, along with Tom Harkin of Iowa, though he is retiring.I met with Waxman last month in the Rayburn House Office Building. His wall is clogged with copies of the landmark bills he played a big role in writing â€” the Clean Air Act, the Tobacco Control Act and the Affordable Care Act, among others. Waxman, who is 74, is known for using any means at his disposal to move an issue forward, writing letters he knows will be ignored, commissioning studies, demanding hearings and engaging in all manner of arduous maneuverings that will, little by little, add to the public record and build a case over years, even decades. He is thorough, tactical and relentless; â€œtougher than a boiled owl,â€ in the famous words of the former Republican senator Alan Simpson. When news of Waxmanâ€™s retirement reached a gathering of House Republicans at their annual retreat in January, it was reportedly met with a standing ovation.Though he insists he is not retiring in frustration, Waxman clearly feels some. â€œPeople here are genuinely unhappy,â€ he told me, â€œhereâ€ being the House of Representatives. â€œRepublicans are in the majority and yet act like an aggrieved minority. Democrats are not happy because of the stupid things Republicans make us do every day.â€ Congress has always been difficult, he said; politics comes with multiple headaches, and making legislation is not designed to be painless. But it was easier for Waxman to abide this over the years because the rewards, when they came, were immensely satisfying â€” and because he also enjoyed overwhelming support in his district, being re-elected with more than 60 percent of the vote every other year since he came to Congress.But that changed in 2012, when the district was redrawn to include less-reliable Democratic areas, and Waxman was opposed by a self-funded Independent, Bill Bloomfield, who spent nearly $8 million, compared with the $2.7 million Waxman spent on his campaign. The experience was wearying, perhaps even slightly traumatic, for Waxman, who wound up winning with 54 percent of the vote. Clearly, he did not relish another campaign like that one, just to earn the right to almost certainly serve once again in the minority and be forced to keep voting against the latest effort to repeal Obamacare, as he was headed to do on this afternoon.While dogged, Waxman is typically soft-spoken, polite and not prone to any of the cable-ready histrionics that many of his colleagues have been weaned on. But on the day I met with him, I found him unusually outspoken, even occasionally disdainful. He despises what he calls the â€œintentional ignoranceâ€ of so many of his Republican colleagues â€” the silliness of what passes for political dialogue, the shallowness of the media and the need of his fellow politicians to seek attention at any cost. He referred with obvious pride to â€œthe things on the wall behind me.â€ Surely, it rankles him to read actual headlines on the way out like â€œRichard Simmons Will Not Run for Waxmanâ€™s Seat.â€When he speaks of those who have lined up to succeed him, Waxman makes the requisite mention of â€œsome good, qualified candidates,â€ but he has no plans to endorse anyone before the primary election on June 3. And he is not sure he will endorse anyone after the primary either. He is amused by the naÃ¯vetÃ© of prospective members who â€œtalk like they can just wave a magic wandâ€ and make the problems of Washington go away. He reserves particular ridicule for Williamson and her claim that she wants to â€œjust get people talkingâ€ in order to â€œhealâ€ our politics. â€œShe says she is going to come in here and â€˜change the dialogue,â€™ â€ Waxman said, assuming a mocking tone. â€œShe says, â€˜Weâ€™re going to talk about helping kids and protecting the food supplyâ€™ and other things. Itâ€™s as if nobody has ever thought of this before.â€In recent weeks, Williamson has received an inordinate amount of press attention in national outlets. She is an exotic political animal and perfect media catnip. She also has raised more than $1 million (including $100,000 of her own), has high name recognition and enjoys an undeniable following that might just put her over the top in a low-turnout, off-year congressional election. Waxman first learned about Williamson when his colleague, Lois Capps, Democrat of Santa Barbara, was pushing her to be the House chaplain many years ago. â€œI even supported her,â€ Waxman said.I suggested to him that, had he not decided to retire, it might be kind of fun to run against the likes of Williamson. â€œYes, thatâ€™s all I need,â€ Waxman said, then muttered something under his breath in Yiddish.A few days later, I was sitting in Marianne Williamsonâ€™s home in Brentwood, a luxury apartment just off Wilshire Boulevard. It is a warm and vast space, filled with books, art and frantic activity. â€œCan someone hand me my glasses?â€ Williamson called out, and an aide quickly fetched them. She was sitting in her living room, Googling around for a quote from Thomas Jefferson that she wanted to share with me. â€œYou know the one,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s on the monument.â€ She said she would email it to me.Williamson, it should be noted, looks amazing for 61, in that well-moisturized-L.A.-famous-person kind of way. She is both self-assured and, it seems, hypersensitive to caricature. A Washington Post profile of her had come out a few days earlier, in which she was called â€œa spiritual sageâ€ and a â€œNew Age guru.â€ She called it â€œquite snarkyâ€ and has often complained, perhaps with some justification, of the snide perspective of many in the press. When I mentioned to Williamson that Henry Waxman appears to share that snarky view, however, she seemed genuinely hurt. She asked what heâ€™d been saying. When I told her, she paused, took a breath and gathered herself.Williamson said she would like to heal the public record of a few misconceptions:1) â€œI would never, ever in my life say I want to go to Washington to heal the soul of Washington.â€2) It is â€œcreepyâ€ to be referred to as a â€œspiritual teacher.â€3) â€œIâ€™m an author. When youâ€™ve written 10 books and have six on the New York Times best-seller list â€” and four have been No. 1 â€” I think you have a right to be a member of Congress.â€4) â€œI never called myself a spiritual guru.â€5) â€œI am not a woo-woo silly person.â€Williamson said that Waxman did many good things in Congress but has become part of a political system that has embraced the â€œentrenched, calcified thought-forms that maybe were relevant four decades ago.â€ Like Roske, she is running as an Independent and entered the race well before Waxman announced he was retiring. Williamson also emphasized that she embraces her role as an â€œoutside the boxâ€ candidate because â€œthe box is toxic.â€ Then the phone rang, and she apologized, but she couldnâ€™t be late for the next thing: it was live. She added one more thought before getting on the line: â€œThere is a cancer that is eating our democracy.â€That cancer is the influence of money on politics, which if you can get beyond the caricature is the legitimate centerpiece of Williamsonâ€™s campaign. She pounds the theme in house parties throughout the district. The parties are filled with devoted readers and acolytes â€” Eva Longorias and Grammy winners and a woman from â€œGleeâ€ â€” who make up her political base. Heads bob when Williamson discusses money. â€œThe House of Representatives was supposed to be where the shopkeeper could come in and the candlemaker could come in,â€ she says, but now it is a servant of only the mega-financed. And where else but here, in this fertile crescent of American possibility, could a very wealthy spiritual guru who does not like to be called a spiritual guru go on to become a 21st-century version of the iconic candlemaker-leader that the founders envisioned?â€œWhen I started my career, 20 years ago, my conversation seemed fringe,â€ Williamson said. â€œToday that fringe is baked into the cake. You are fringe if you donâ€™t know what it is. Youâ€™re the one who looks silly today if you donâ€™t have some understanding of some integrated holistic perspective on life.â€Williamson is a clear departure from California 33â€™s more mainstream candidates, and while I have no polling to support this inkling, I get a vague feeling that in the current environment, there might be nothing more powerful than an authentic voice, whether or not Henry Waxman thinks it belongs to a flake. Whether Williamson represents an â€œoutside the boxâ€ diversion or a welcome departure remains to be seen, but if your candidacy rests on that question, there are worse places to be running for office than California 33.â€œThis is not just a political issue but a spiritual one,â€ Williamson told me, and I believed that she believed that. If a society factors an issue only through economics, she went on, â€œrather than â€˜How are the kids?â€™ â€˜Am I harmful to anyone or anything?â€™ â€˜Am I an instrument of good, of higher purpose?â€™ â€ we could end up, in her words, becoming members of some sociopathic new world order. â€œAnd a sociopath has no conscience,â€ she said. â€œA sociopath has no remorse.â€Later that day, I went to see Matt Miller, a Pacific Palisades resident, who was struggling to define himself among the other â€œoutside the boxâ€ candidates. Like many of his fellow contenders, Miller has never run for office, and part of his shtick is to convey a sense of faux-wide-eyed discovery over his journey into the fetid campaign world. â€œIâ€™ve become a telemarketer,â€ Miller told a crowd gathered at a small fund-raiser at the offices of the talent agency William Morris Endeavor in downtown Beverly Hills. He marveled at the many hours he spends each day on the phone begging people for money. â€œBut I am a telemarketer with a vision for America!â€Miller is running as a Democrat, but he speaks the language of the serious-minded Independent. He worked at McKinsey & Company and at the Office of Management and Budget of the Clinton White House and publicly boasts of having read every line of the federal budget. His radio show, â€œLeft, Right and Center,â€ has a loyal following among the highly educated listeners who make up much of this highly educated district. The show features three hosts â€” someone on the left, someone on the right and Miller, who occupies the â€œcenter.â€ Even when progressives are in power, as they now are in the White House, â€œvirtually every measure of a good society that progressives care about will be going in the wrong direction,â€ he said. Meanwhile, he also said, â€œthe G.O.P. is off on some Neanderthal track.â€ Forty or so supporters, sipping white wine and eating peppered tuna and shrimp on sticks, nodded in affirmation. â€œThere are lawyers and career politicians in this race,â€ Miller said. â€œThereâ€™s even a spiritual guru!â€ A waiter in the back cheered. His name was Steve, and he identified himself as a â€œlongtime devotee of Marianne Williamson.â€I saw Miller again a few weeks later at a Democratic forum in Pacific Palisades, a self-styled â€œMayberry by the Sea.â€ (As a local favorite, he quoted the T-shirt: â€œIf youâ€™re rich, you live in Beverly Hills. If youâ€™re famous, you live in Malibu. If youâ€™re lucky, you live in Pacific Palisades.â€ Appreciative chuckles all around.) Miller was joined onstage by Greuel and Lieu, and â€” typical of the random out-of-nowhere nature of this race â€” some other guy Iâ€™d never heard of named David Kanuth. But as it turns out, Kanuth, a handsome 37-year-old public defender, managed to raise $800,000 last quarter with the help of supporters like Chris Oâ€™Donnell, Gwyneth Paltrow and L L Cool J. He immediately signaled his out-of-the-boxness. Kanuth entered the race, he said from the stage, â€œbecause I am frustrated by what I see in Washingtonâ€; the country, he said, â€œneeds to come together and get things done.â€ I imagined Waxman muttering in Yiddish about whether anyone had ever thought of this before.Between applause lines about how great Henry Waxman is, the candidates generally yammered on about their own relative out-of-the-boxness. Miller noted that he had written a book â€œthat presidents have read and praised.â€ He also said something about wanting to create â€œmarket incentives to incentivize.â€ Greuel said she was â€œa fighter,â€ â€œa doerâ€ and â€œa warrior,â€ and she wanted to make sure her children and grandchildren have the same opportunities she did. (Another excellent idea.) Then she said something about â€œa war going on in their country against womenâ€ and â€œa war on gay marriageâ€ and â€œa war against L.G.B.T.â€ But the best moment came near the end, when a high-school student asked Greuel what she planned to do about congressional redistricting and gerrymandering. Greuel, who until recently lived outside of the district boundaries of California 33, responded with a stemwinder about the necessity of civic involvement and how her late father taught her the importance of voting. As she spoke, I was reminded that even in this, a supposedly eclectic and creative district, Waxman succeeded, in part, because he came to embody a familiar and nonexotic figure. Liberal and effective, he was entirely palatable, perhaps even more so because of the unglamorous yin he represented to the districtâ€™s showbiz yang. He fought hard but played by the rules and occupied a reliable space, even if it was well inside the box.Greuel wound down by asking the high-school student â€” a senior named Leland Meade-Miller, from Pacific Palisades â€” if he was going to be 18 by June 3, the date of the runoff.â€œYes,â€ he said, â€œand the question was about redistricting. . . .â€The Palisades debate may have been closed to Independent candidates, but Roske used the weekend to host the inaugural â€œRoske for Congress Regatta,â€ a race from near his home dock at the Pacific Mariners Yacht Club to Washington Pier and back. I arrived at his yacht, the Rob Roy, to find about 35 people there on the dock, friends and yacht people and actors, sipping Champagne and holding little plastic American flags. The winner of the race, a British man named Richard Norman, seemed barely aware that Roske was even running for Congress. When I asked if he would vote for him, Norman said sure, why not? â€œThey all start out with such good intentions,â€ he said, sighing.Melissa Fitzgerald, another friend from the fake White House â€” she played the assistant to President Bartletâ€™s press secretary C. J. Cregg â€” walked by as Roske, in sunglasses and a navy â€œRoske for Congressâ€ polo shirt, gleefully led a camera crew around the dock. This crew was separate from the hypothetical one that would accompany him to Washington after his election. â€œThey wanted to make a documentary about how a quote unquote â€˜ordinary personâ€™ runs for Congress,â€ he said, a perma-grin returning to his wind-burned face. Louis Armstrongâ€™s â€œItâ€™s a Wonderful Worldâ€ played over a speaker. â€œBrent,â€ one guest called out, â€œyou look like you could be in a Cialis commercial!â€The Rob Roy, which is named for the 18th-century folk hero known as the Scottish Robin Hood, seemed to reflect the winking, mildly subversive nature of Roskeâ€™s campaign. He has pledged, after all, to spend no more than $5,000 on the race, or multiple zeros shy of whatâ€™s typically needed to run for a congressional seat in the Los Angeles media market. As Roske looked over the boats, arrayed along what he called a â€œblue-collar yacht club,â€ he went into a spiel about how sailing is an aspirational exercise. Politics and entertainment are similar in that regard, he said. You envision things, and then you try to make them so, whether theyâ€™re reality or fiction. But politics, and the entire business of Washington, is ultimately for keeps: Real lives are affected and not just projected for our amusement, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. Being a serious candidate entails a great deal of caution, and it explains why so many candidates stay boring, predictable and box-bound. In passing, Schiff told me that â€œThe West Wingâ€ was â€œa bunch of good-looking people who cry every once in a while.â€ But the real appeal of the show was its ability to depict why the C. J. Creggs of the world â€” and, by extension, the Wendy Greuels â€” stay on message in public.As guests filed off the dock, Roske gathered everyone who remained and laid out some of his ideas, like giving weekly speeches on the steps of the Capitol. Later he called out to a photographer and the assembled guests. â€œCâ€™mon everyone,â€ Roske said, standing up on the deck, making lots of hand gestures. â€œWeâ€™re going to do a fake little photo shoot. One, two, three, now everyone laugh like I just said something funny.â€",1
"America Shocked After Barron Trump Spotted For The First Time Since Rosie ODonnell Incident [WATCH] Rosie ODonnell received major backlash after sinking so low she went after 10-year-old Barron Trump to get back at his father.

"NY Residents Test Off The Charts For Dangerous Drinking Water ToxinBy Brandon Turbeville While this may seem like a problem more specific to Harold and Marion, the average reading for residents in Hoosick Falls is 23.5. The average person up there is about 11 times the national average, said Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, a village representative. The reasons why the tests were conducted in the first place is because residents of Hoosick Falls launched their own effort to determine whether or not something toxic was in the water after several of them died of rare cancers. These residents suspected a nearby plastics manufacturing site as being the most likely culprit. The chemical they found in their water supply and the residents themselves PFOA has been linked to both kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disease and ulcerative colitis as well as many other illnesses. But what is even more concerning than the presence of PFOA in the water supply is that both state and local officials knew about the situation a full year before the federal Environmental Protection Agency warned residents to stop drinking their water November 2015. All the while, these officials did nothing. In fact, despite the warnings from the EPA and high levels of PFOA found in recent tests, Rensselaer County officials and the state government continued to assure residents their water was safe. Assemblyman McLaughlin, however, is demanding the U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara investigate. The Cuomo administartion took affirmative steps to deny the public information, McLaughlin said. They pushed back against the EPA. The Cuomo administration claimed they were following the EPA guidelines when they were not. In my mind, thats a crime. Cuomo administration officials claim that the state Health Department was helping filter and test the water and that it followed EPA guidelines. Admittedly, this claim is hard to believe after the state hid information about the toxicity levels of the water supply for a full year and even then continued to assure residents that their water is safe when it is not. Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, pledged in February that he would hold hearings about the situation but has since backed down on his promise. PFOA contamination was also found in the water supply of Petersburgh, another town of Rensselaer County in February of this year. Rensselaer County is only tens of miles northeast of Albany and serves as proof that situations like Flint, Michigans water crisis, now a well known humanitarian crisis, are unfortunately not uncommon.

"Even before Mahmoud Abbas announced that he would not seek re-election as the Palestinian president, throwing the Palestinian Authority into chaos, America's closest Arab allies, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, had begun to despair over Washington's Middle East missteps, government officials and political experts said. With Israel having rebuffed American calls to freeze settlement-building, and with the prospects for substantive peace talks fading, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are increasingly viewed in the region as diminished actors whose influence is on the wane, political experts say. They have been challenged by Iran, opposed by much smaller Arab neighbors, mocked by Syria and defied by influential nonstate groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Even while Iran has been focused on its domestic political crisis, and Syria has struggled with an economic and water crisis, their continued support for Hamas and Hezbollah has preserved for them a strong hand in matters like the formation of a new government in Lebanon and efforts to reconcile Palestinian factions, officials and analysts said. Officials in Saudi Arabia and Egypt acknowledge all this; they admit that they are no longer masters of their universe. What they do not agree upon is how to respond. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has decided that Arab unity is the only way to re-establish the kingdom's leading role and to blunt Iran's growing influence. The king has begun a diplomatic drive to smooth relations with two Arab leaders who have insulted and admonished him in the past, Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and, more recently, President Bashar Assad of Syria. Egyptian officials say they wish the king well but have declined to participate in his reconciliation initiative because they think it will fail as long as Syria determines that the advantages of playing the spoiler outweigh the gains of pushing for peace. 'If there is no peace, then all those who bet against peace are winning,' said an Egyptian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid increasing tensions with the United States or Saudi Arabia. 'And all those who act and bet there will be peace are losing, like us. We are losing because we are putting this bet.' The great promise of President Barack Obama's June speech in Cairo, officials and political commentators said, was severely damaged when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, on her recent trip to the Middle East, praised as 'unprecedented' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to slow the building of settlements. That left the leadership of Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- the two regional American allies most committed to negotiating with Israel -- exposed, embarrassed and weakened, political analysts and government officials. 'Egypt's role is receding regionally, and its cards are limited,' said Emad Gad, an expert in international relations at the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. 'Their main card, which is reconciliation and peace, is receding.' Egypt says these efforts will come to nothing until there is progress in the peace process, an approach the Saudis have not accepted. Even as its vast reserves of oil money have expanded its global influence, Saudi Arabia finds itself unable to exert its will even on its own border, where it blames Iran for stoking an uprising against the government in Yemen; or in Lebanon, where its chief source of influence, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated. Even its goal of leading the Persian Gulf states, under the umbrella of the Gulf Cooperation Council, has faltered. 'Saudi's role in the last 10 years has declined,' said Abdulkarim H. al-Dekhayel, a political science professor at King Saud University in Riyadh. 'The leadership now feels it has to try to reset the agenda.' The Saudis have decided that the key to re-establishing a strong hand in the region rests broadly in Arab unity and specifically in Syria. Syria has close economic and political ties with Iran. It hosts the political leadership of the militant group Hamas. It shares a border with Iraq and has been accused of allowing militants and weapons to cross over. It has a close alliance with Hezbollah. All of these are excellent tools for undermining Saudi efforts to blunt Iran and push for peace with Israel. 'The relations between the Arab countries, if they are solid, if the understanding is there, if the cohesiveness of their policy exists, then there is no worry,' said Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's longtime foreign minister. 'It is only when there is division, and looking for other alternatives between the Arab countries, that creates problems.' But Saudi Arabia's challenge is also one of leverage, political analysts and Saudi officials said. How does Saudi Arabia convince Syria to switch from the anti-peace camp to the pro-peace camp? The Saudis have hinted at two strategies. One involves giving Syria much-needed economic assistance. The other, though not stated directly, involves Lebanon. Syria has made it clear that it views events in Lebanon as central to its national security, as well as its pride. Saudi Arabia has tried in recent years to keep Lebanon in its orbit through proxies and cash infusions. But lately it has suggested that it might not object to Syria reasserting political control there. 'What is recognized is that Lebanon is more important to Syria than any other Arab country,' said a Saudi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize officials in either country. 'It's in its backyard. We understand that. But what we are looking for is some kind of Arab unity to stop foreign intervention in our Arab affairs.' Egyptian officials, for their part, have been trying to reconcile the Palestinian factions, which have been at odds since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. While that is looking ever more remote, the Egyptians believe that a deal between Hamas and Fatah would already have been reached as a result of their mediation efforts if not for intervention by Syria, officials said. Egyptian officials say they would be delighted if Saudi Arabia succeeded, not only in mending relations with Syria, but also in convincing the Syrians to sever ties with Iran, stop supporting Hamas and actually support the Arab initiative, which offers Israel peace in return for withdrawal to 1967 border lines, establishment of an independent Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital and a 'just solution' to the refugee problem. But the Egyptians said they simply did not believe that would happen. 'Does the West give any support to those moderates on the Palestinian front, on the Arab side, that advocate peace, that say, 'It is not about resistance anymore, but what we want can be achieved through negotiations'?' said the Saudi government official. 'The answer is, 'No.' Do we have an empty hand? The answer is, 'Yes.' ' ",1
"Citing a desire to finally make a difference in Iraq, in the past two weeks, more than 800,000 young people from upper-middle- and upper-class families have put aside their education, careers, and physical well-being to enlist in the military, new data from the Department Of Defense shows. Young Manhattanites line up outside the Times Square recruitment office. 'I don't know if it was the safety and comfort of the holidays or what, but I realized that my affluence and ease of living comes at a cost,' said Private Jonathan Grace, 18, who was to commence studies at Dartmouth College next fall, but will instead attend 12 weeks of basic training before being deployed to Fallujah with the 1st Army Battalion. 'I just looked at my parents in their cashmere sweaters and thought, 'Who am I to go to an elite liberal arts college and spend all my time reading while, in the real world, thousands of kids my age are sacrificing their lives for our country?' It's not right.' Added Grace: 'Whether I agree with the war or not, our president needs us, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let our least advantaged citizens bear the brunt of this awesome burden.' At the on-campus temporary recruitment table at Reed College in Portland, OR, the line of students eager to sign up for active duty stretched around the block Monday. Recruiters across the country reported a similar trend, with scores of young people asking how soon they could be ready to go to battle in Iraq. 'They don't have these recruitment centers where I live,' said Daniel Feldman, 26, who resides in the affluent neighborhood of Brookline, MA and recently passed his bar exam. 'I didn't realize you could just sign up, but now that I do, all of my friends from law school, yoga class, and temple are going to join, too. And not the Reserves either. We're talking down and dirty, right on the front lines.' Drill sergeants at boot camps in South Carolina and San Diego, though at first skeptical of the recent crop of potential Marines, said they have been impressed by their work ethic, claiming the wealthy youngsters' desire to 'do their part' is undeniable. 'They haven't complained once since getting here,' Sergeant Greg Forenczek said of the new upper-crust recruits. 'Usually, after the first two hours, you know who's going to get dismissed early, but not with these kids. There's a fire in their eyesa fearless passion to become U.S. soldiers' 'They inspire me,' Forenczek added. New Marine Sierra Pettingill, a 22-year-old sociology major who left Duke University before her final semester, said she felt compelled to serve after realizing she did not have a single acquaintance who had died, or even served, in Iraq. 'I was sending out invitations to my champagne-brunch birthday get-together when I heard that U.S. military casualties in Iraq had reached 2,900,' Pettingill said. 'I decided then and there that I would not allow this inherently unequal system to perpetuate any longer, no matter how much I want to go have martini night at the Oak Room.' Though most of the privileged enlistee youths said they were motivated by a newfound concern that America's reputation could be permanently damaged with a loss in Iraq, others have cited the examples set by their relatives as instrumental in their decision to join. 'My great-great-great-great grandfather would not have been able to make a fortune in the fur trade and real-estate business had it not been for the brave people who fought in the Revolutionary War,' said 24-year-old John Jacob Astor VIII, who has put all of his business ventures on hold indefinitely. 'My children are going to know the importance of stepping up to the plate when their nation needs them.' 'From this day forth, the Astor name will be synonymous with sacrifice,' he added. U.S. Gen. John Abizaid, who has in the past argued against a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, now says that with the influx of nearly a million troops expected to be on the ground Feb. 1, the region should be stabilized within six weeks.

"A week is a long time in running. Or, to be more precise, a week is long time if you are planning to run pretty much continually throughout it. After a few rash decisions and some naive optimism, I am now in the Gobi desert in China, about to face this exciting, if somewhat daunting, prospect. The Ultra Trail of the Gobi (UTG) describes itself as a 400km (250-mile) single-stage, self-navigated, self-supported race. Loosely based on the journey of a seventh-century Buddhist monk Xuanzang (he took several years), the route passes some truly inhospitable terrain in Gansu Province. In his records, Xuanzang describes it as a place that contains â€œnothing but barren sand and dry river bedsâ€, where â€œwhen it is hot, the heat sears you like a flame; when it is cold, the wind cuts your flesh like a knifeâ€. Based on information from someone who has checked out the course, it doesnâ€™t sound as if much has changed in the past 1,400 years. During this race, the 49 other competitors and I will have to battle with temperatures ranging from -20C to 30C, avoid underfed wild dogs and wolves and face a 3000-metre mountain thrown in for good measure. The cut-off time is 150 hours â€“ and the clock runs continuously.   Related: Marathon des Sables: toenails gone, friends made and a race complete   The UTG is part of a growing trend among runners to experiment with just how far they can physically go. Twenty years ago, people might have been impressed with a marathon, but since then, distance inflation has been rampant. Much as most long-distance runners hate to admit it, impressing others canâ€™t be ignored as a motivation and, when a slightly overweight, middle-aged standup comedian ran 27 marathons in 27 days, they ceased to produce the requisite awe. Itâ€™s perhaps unsurprising therefore that ultramarathons (technically anything more than 26.2 miles) have been rising in popularity over the past decade. In the US, the number of runners completing races of more than 50km (31 miles) rose from roughly 11,000 in 2000, to more than 72,000 last year. In the UK, there has also been an explosion in the number of â€œultrasâ€, with many selling out at the speed of Glastonbury tickets. With a growing middle class, China has also seen the racesâ€™ popularity rising fast in recent years; it seems life has to be quite comfortable before one voluntarily choses to make it uncomfortable. The UTG is in its own league of â€œsuper ultraâ€ races. To put the distance into perspective, the worldâ€™s most famous desert race, the Marathon des Sables, which I trudged my way through in 2014, is 250km and is broken into six stages over six days. Add in the navigation, the extremes of temperature and the need to develop a â€œsleep strategyâ€ and the Gobi ultra becomes a logistically complex form of self-flagellation.   Related: The Gobi March ultra: a 155-mile, seven-day antidote to modern life   Signing up for the UTG in June didnâ€™t leave a great deal of time for training. The advice I received from others who had done similar events was simply to run as much as possible. With an 11km plod to and from work and a couple of long runs on the weekend, I was able to build up to 120-150km a week quite quickly but, between work and travelling, I struggled to go much beyond that. Food, both the eating of it and the planning of it, was the other priority. While training, I discovered a new appreciation of all-you-can-eat restaurants. For the actual race, the rules require competitors to bring 25,000 calories, most of which can be placed in drop bags along the course. In the past Iâ€™ve found most energy bars too sweet and synthetic, but recently Iâ€™ve been fortunate to discover some people in London making sports food out of beetroot, goji berries and just about every other â€œsuperfoodâ€ you can imagine. My medical certification for the UTG wasnâ€™t without complications. In February, I visited a doctor in Kathmandu for a routine checkup. Much to my, and I think his, surprise, he found a large hole in my heart. One open-heart surgery, a week in hospital and three months of impatient recovery later, and I was back to running again, a little out of shape, but now with the advantage of a fully functional heart. Joining me in the Gobi will be an impressive bunch of experienced masochists. The international field includes Pavel Paloncy, multiple winner of the brutal Spine race; Harvey Lewis and Marshall Ulrich, both multiple winners of the famously gruelling 135-mile Badwater race in Death Valley; and Jenny Davis, professional ultra-runner and campaigner for womenâ€™s participation in sport. The Chinese competitors, including some who have already run the course, are known to be formidable. If Iâ€™m able to keep up for more than a few hundred yards, I might even be able to find out more about them. Signal and sanity permitting, I will be updating the Guardian running blog with my progress across the Gobi from 28 September. You can also follow my deterioration on Instagram @jogonalfie ",1
"The Illusion of Choice ... 90% of American Media Controlled by 6 CorporationsBy Vic Bishop The conglomerates are: General Electric, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. All are corporations that have their own shady histories, dealings and suspicious actors. Disney being widely regarded as an occult enterprise aimed at warping the minds of children with disturbing subliminal imagery. One of these companies is also the 12th largest US military defense contractor, so its no surprise that so much of our entertainment centers around the glorification of war and violence. By surveying what is available for consumption in the mass media, it is easy to see what type of society these 6 corporations are helping to construct. They have the power to warp reality by calling staged shows reality shows. Ideas which dont support mainstream narratives and the consumer agenda are omitted, and stories about independent people overcoming strife without dependence on government are seldom if ever elevated. READ: 11 Tactics Used by the Mainstream Media to Manufacture Consent for the Oligarchy The promotion of shallow, materialistic, ego-centric values, and the obvious dumbing down of the American population is coming from these 6 corporations. Think about that. These are the companies that glorify consumption, obedience, ignorance, the hyper-sexualization of youth, the glorification of war and government surveillance, and so on. The advertisers that support these media companies have tremendous sway over what makes it on the airwaves. They help to control public perception. The bottom line is that corporate media is a behemoth of special interests and mind controllers. So much of the human story is omitted in this capitalistic, for-profit environment scheme like this, which is why now more than ever the independent, alternative media is such a gem for human kind. The info-graphic below was produced in 2011 by FrugalDad.com, and although there have been some changes to the information since then, the landscape of American media is well represented here. Compare today to 1983 when the industry was occupied by some 50 independent media companies. Some changes to the graphic noted by Business Insider: NOTE: This infographic is from last year and is missing some key transactions. GE does not own NBC (or Comcast or any media) anymore. So that 6th company is now Comcast. And Time Warner doesnt own AOL, so Huffington Post isnt affiliated with them. With such tremendous global reach in all forms of media communication, these corporations help to shape our world by providing coverage of our lives, analyses of our world, entertainment to pass our time and inspire our minds, and even distraction and occupation for our children. Vic Bishop is a staff writer for Waking Times. Sources: And today, speaking of the news, I wonder whats going on that the powers that be dont want us to know about or be aware of with all the headlines and hubbub concerning Katrina AGAIN? Even ol Bushy has his mug in the news connected with Katrina. I feel badly for the people who have been overlooked all this time, I surely do, but I still am curious about whats happening today in the background somewhere! Then again . . . Watch the news on RT or Aljazzeera. They are no bastion. Your suggestion please. Whats your suggestion then? Im always open to alternative sources for news the more the better. This is half the story. List the stock owners of the six, the banks that control and the pigs there that make life miserable for the rest of us. Corporations are not people. Corporations are modern day slave owners. Guess who the slaves are? were. no theyre not people. theyre satanist. No choice: a child born to American parents is forced to be a U.S. citizen at birth so their labor can be used to acquire tax money to fight wars for the elite. The child is enslaved at birth without choice. The mother cannot take the child from the hospital until the child is a registered slave of the United States. If this is true then we should be glad there are so many Anchor Babies being squirted out as soon as their mothers cross our southern border. All those anchor babies are the property of the state. If, I only say if to be nice, the draft for duty in our military services is reinstated, and it will be reinstated some time, we will have a never ending supply of cannon fodder to draw down on. ",0
"Was Hillary Clinton Involved in Benghazi Attack to Provoke More Bloodshed?Susanne Posel Except, there was no US Embassy in Benghazi. There was a diplomatic office or CIA-compound which was burned to the ground. The nearest US Embassy to the area is in Tripoli. Stevens, hardly being a US Ambassador, but rather a gunrunner for the behind the scenes terroristic attacks by the Saudi Arabian nation on the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia adheres to Salafism, an extremist form of Islam that want all other forms of the religion wiped off the map. Stevens was ultimately killed by the same group he had provided guns and other armory for when they were employed by the US to commit the false flag attack on the CIA-compound in Benghazi. The Government Accountability Office has threatened in a recent report to evaluate Clintons role in the attack. Diplomatic Security, which is the responsibility of the US State Department, is compromised if Clinton will allow coerced attacks using US-operatives masquerading as Islamic terrorists for the purpose of committing a flase flag to instigate war with Middle Eastern nations. Clinton, trying to appear to be concerned about the event, vowed publicly to find those responsible for the attack. She said: There are continuing questions about what exactly happened in Benghazi on that night three weeks ago. We will not rest until we answer those questions and until we track down the terrorists who killed our people. Coinciding with Stevens death multiple waves of manufactured Muslim uprisings seemed to validate the terrorist attack. A US-funded film was created with the assistance of an FBI-informant who just happened to be an Israeli citizen. Over 100 Jewish donors gave money to have this wag the dog trailer produced so that the Islamic riots would have a purpose. Creating spin to further convolute the issue, Clinton remarked: We have a lot of work to do to give complete and accurate responses to all the questions and statements that are swirling out there. Lets establish all the facts before we jump to any conclusions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was deployed to Tripoli, where the actual US Embassy is located. The crime scene in Benghazi was left to be destroyed by CIA-operatives dressed up as rioters to contaminate the evidence. The State Department claims that cryptic warnings of an impending attack on Benghazi was relayed, yet devoid of a time frame and therefore ignored. In response, Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and Jason Chaffetz, House Representative of Utah are demanding an investigation and that Clinton explain the actions of the State Department in the time up and until the coordinated attack. According to the letter from Issa to Clinton: Based on information provided to the Committee by individuals with direct knowledge of events in Libya, the attack that claimed the ambassadors life was the latest in a long line of attacks on Western diplomats and officials in Libya in the months leading up to September 11, 2012. It was clearly never, as Administration officials once insisted, the result of a popular protest, the committees chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and subcommittee chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, write. In addition, multiple U.S. federal government officials have confirmed to the Committee that, prior to the September 11 attack, the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi. The mission in Libya, however, was denied these resources by officials in Washington. Stevens, having no idea that he was about to be sacrificed by the US government for the sake of a false flag attack, was not concerned about utilizing security in the days before the bombing. In fact, Clinton authorized the security to be lessened in Benghazi and the US Marines guarding the US Embassy in Tripoli to be disarmed. Clinton wrote back to Issa, saying: I appreciate that you and your committee are deeply interested in finding out what happened leading up to and during the attacks in Benghazi, and are looking for ways to prevent it from happening again. I share that commitment. She asked Issa to allow that any summations of the event at Benghazi be held off until November, after the elections, or perhaps into 2013 because witnesses were being questioned at the State Departments Office of Legislative Affairs. This must be a request to defer the issue until Clinton and their lackeys can get their stories straight. To keep the truth that the attack on Benghazi was a US-backed false flag, documents at the compound were destroyed just prior to the attack. This act mirrors the sudden shredding of documents at the US Embassy in Beirut that destroyed classified information. These documents showed the names of Libyans who were working with the US as well as oil contracts and information regarding the coordinated attack. Clinton was in contact with the al-Qaeda operatives who attacked the compound in Benghazi and murdered Stevens just 48 hours before the event was enacted. Publicly, the US State Department denies this fact by refusing to comment. The compound in Benghazi that was burned by al-Qaeda operatives was looted to make sure all evidence was removed before the press, residents of Libya or any official could gain access to the buildings. The compound in Benghazi was a safe-house that Stevens would have fled to during an emergency situation. Knowing this, Clinton combined fake revolutionaries with CIA-operatives to create a situation that could be spun to serve the purpose of the US and Israel in destroying the sovereign nations in the Middle East. Last month Clinton admitted that al-Qaeda was used in the attack in Benghazi. Speaking to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Clinton stated that al-Qaeda was employed to facilitate a manufactured threat of Islamic extremism in the region. Clinton explains: Now with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to maneuver, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions. And they are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi. In line with the US version of the story, Israeli intelligence reported that This attack , along with the one in Egypt, is a reminder of the Iranian invasion of a U.S. embassy in Tehran that led to a lengthy hostage crisis which brought down the [President Jimmy] Carter administration.

"Kuwait Mandates DNA Database For All ResidentsBy Brandon Turbeville This is because the small nation recently announced the passage of a law that mandates every person residing in Kuwait must submit to a DNA sample that will be stored in a massive database upon penalty of fines and jail time. Kuwait has 1.3 million citizens that will be subject to the law but its 2.9 million foreign residents are subject as well. Any person who refuses to submit to the DNA tests and data mining operation will be subject to $33,000 in fines and up to one year in prison. Any person who provides a fake sample will face up to seven years. Kuwait passed this law conveniently after an Islamic State (and thus NATO-directed) bombing of a Shiite mosque on June 26. The law is being justified as a way to make it easier for law enforcement to track down criminals and terrorists after the attacks have been committed. Thus, the incident stands as another Problem-Reaction-Solution-style terrorist attack justifying an even more totalitarian police state response. We have approved the DNA testing law and approved the additional funding. We are prepared to approve anything needed to boost security measures in the country, independent MP Jamal Al Omar said. Kuwait now stands as the only country in the world that makes DNA tests and participation in a DNA database compulsory. But is it just the first? After all, many countries including England, Australia, Sweden, and the United States maintain stored databases of the DNA of convicted criminals with the United States maintaining a database of the DNA of even those who have merely been arrested but not convicted. In addition, the U.S. database also maintains the DNA of missing persons and their families. Now, with the exception of Kuwait, the United States maintains the worlds largest DNA database. The growing number of countries building, maintaining, and subsequently mandating various forms of biometric identification and biometric databases is not only concerning, it is becoming the norm. In 2012, India launched a nationwide program involving the allocation of a Unique Identification Number (UID) to every single one of its 1.2 billion residents. Each of the numbers are tied to the biometric data of the recipient using three different forms of information fingerprints, iris scans, and pictures of the face. All ten digits of the hand will be recorded, and both eyes are scanned. The Japanese have had a mandatory national UID system in place since 2002, under the Basic Resident Register (BRR) program. Under the BRR, each individual must provide their name, birthdate, gender, and physical address to municipal governments who, in turn, issue the citizen a UID. However, an update to the initiative, called My Number Bill, was introduced in February 2012 that streamlined the information sharing process between government tax, social security, and emergency mitigation agencies. This was merely the next phase toward the goal of the Japanese government to centralize already-collected information about each one of its citizens and to expand this program to contain even more data. The information collected on Japanese citizens under their current system is fed into a nationwide computer database known as the Juki-net, which is made up of 3,200 municipal governments. The Juki-net serves as the common data sharing database between the municipal governments and, to some extent, the central government. Israel also has a mandatory biometrics program. As Justin Lee writes for BiometricUpdate.com, Initially passed by the Knesset in December 2009, the Biometric Database Law mandates the collection of fingerprints and facial images from all Israeli residents, as well as integrating these biometric details in domestic ID cards and national passports. The legislation also called for the creation of a biometric government database for the purpose of managing access control, identification of individuals and to help law enforcement officials locate criminal suspects. The law is intended to curb identity theft, as well as the loss, theft and destruction of the current blue ID cards issued by the Interior Ministry. In a report submitted to the Prime Ministers Office and to the Knesset Chairman, Erdan emphasized the importance of implementing the biometric system and said the transition would be gradual. Smart biometric records that cannot be faked [] will lead to the full protection of the identity of Israeli citizens, Erdan told Channel 10. It will provide a balance between our duty to ensure the security of citizens and our duty to protect their privacy. We will promote a gradual transition to mandatory biometric documentation. The first phase of the biometric identification system was implemented in June 2013, and since then, some 640,000 people have volunteered to submit their biometric details to the database, said Erdan. While most of the data collection and database storage via biometrics in the United States is rolled out under the auspices of greater convenience, concepts such as biometric programs for food stamp recipients, and employee tagging are gaining traction, indicating that the push for the eventual mandating of participation in such programs is clearly not far off. Kuwait may be the first in terms of mandating DNA database participation in the world, but it is only first. Kuwait simply stands as the latest country to make a step forward in the international game of leap frog toward a global surveillance state, technological control grid, and total prison planet.

"Waking Dreams End UnpleasantlyBrandon Smith When the depression is mentioned, they begin to grasp the gravity of our fiscal disaster, or at least what I am trying to convey. However, those slow on the draw almost always sneer at the validity of the threat. After all, during the Great Depression, there were bank runs, endless soup kitchen lines, roving masses of dirty homeless drifters looking for employment, shanty towns, and desperation everywhere. Weve all seen the old stock black-and-white photos, and the America of today looks nothing similar. We have shopping malls and imported fineries. We have sports cars and HDTV and video games and iPads and Disneyland and pharmaceuticals in every color of the rainbow! We have tract homes and gated communities and condos and beach houses and summer vacations and first-class flights and texting and nightclubs and lattes and credit cards! When we turn on cable news, what do we see? Progress! Glorious progress! All is in recovery. All is as it was yesterday. All is well. For the average unaware citizen, as long as the commercials and the fast food continue, there is nothing to be concerned about. What they have overlooked is that in this country we have had for at least the past decade the illusion of prosperity, and nothing more. Our modern citizenry looks back at the Great Depression and sees a deteriorating exterior that matched the true state of the interior crisis. They look at today, and see a fresh, glimmering, glossy exterior that cleverly hides the rotting financial sinew underneath. In recent articles I discussed the black magic of the stock market, and summarized a position I have held for a very long time: That the Federal Reserve has been injecting a very large percentage of its QE, or fiat stimulus, into the Dow in order to keep the market propped and seemingly prosperous. That this has been done by fueling international banks with capital and then allowing the institutions to flood stocks with purchase orders as well as direct interventions by the Fed itself. What seemed obvious to those of us in independent economic analysis has been called conspiracy theory for the past few years. Finally, the cat has been let out of the bag by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (the same man who admitted that the Federal Reserve is an independent entity that answers to no one, not even Congress, ending decades of misinformation). In the following interview, Greenspan states quite nonchalantly that only the stock market matters, meaning, that the market is no longer a reflector of legitimate economic health or decrepitude; rather, it has become a primary psychological driver. For Greenspan and the Fed, fundamental indicators like true supply and demand are of no importance. The market must be kept inflated at all costs, because its success, no matter how artificial, is the only thing keeping our system from breaking apart:http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000148510play=1 Richard Fisher of the Dallas Federal Reserve, clearly in response to Greenspans comments, openly admitted in a recent interview that the central bank has artificially sustained markets: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-21/least-they-are-finally-honest This is, of course, dangerously backwards. Strong data and legitimate profits are supposed to drive market psychology, which in turn is supposed to increase stock performance. Instead, the market is being manipulated in order to maintain a false sense of economic optimism and keep ignorant investors and consumers spending in the hopes that tomorrow will bring better tidings! Interestingly, the latest minutes from the Fed indicate a push for tapering on bond market purchases, and a diminishment of QE, which is currently pumping over $85 billion per month into our fiscal structure. Part of this effort has been led by Fisher, who owns over $1 million in personal gold holdings (meaning it is doubtful the banker believes that the Fed will actually stop printing, or that the dollar is going to hold its value for much longer). I believe this is a bit of theater designed to remind the country how addicted to fiat we now are, as well as set the stage for the government alone (instead of the government in collusion with central bankers) to be blamed as the scapegoat for an inevitable collapse. Both Greenspan and Fisher in their latest interviews subtly introduce the meme that government indecision and partisan bickering are the ultimate culprits behind the continuing dysfunction of the economy. Both parties do indeed play a role in the crisis, but not in the manner that central bankers assert. The governments greatest crime was allowing the private Federal Reserve to operate with impunity and create the mortgage and derivatives bubble in the first place, while aiding it in policies of inflation and manipulation. The government is a danger to our fiscal system not because of indecision, but because it takes its marching orders from the Federal Reserve and colludes in now openly admitted market manipulation. Will the Fed cut off the flow of stimulus? Possibly. It is important to note that talk of a QE reduction has surfaced right as the Federal Government is set to make a decision on spending cuts and the raising of the national debt ceiling. The first cuts, now called the sequester (a nicer word for austerity), will be administered in early March, and will apparently affect everything from school teaching positions to employment at the Department of Defense. The White House claims that such cuts will damage the U.S. recovery and send the nation hurtling back into recession. Obama is, in a sense, correct. However, I would point out that the federal cuts alone will not be the catalyst for collapse. The Federal Reserves move to reduce QE in conjunction with cuts would be the true trigger of fiscal calamitya controlled calamity with a purpose. Americas financial and social systems only function today because of one thing government spending. The government is officially indebted in the amount of $16 trillion. Unofficially, the number is closer to $120 trillion. These massive liabilities have been accrued mainly through entitlement programs and state welfare. Foreign investment in U.S. Treasury bonds does not produce anywhere near the capital needed to maintain such programs, which is why the Federal Reserve is now the world largest holder of U.S. debt (surpassing even China). Without the Feds endless printing and bond buying schemes, the government cannot continue entitlement programs, and, it cannot feed money to dependent states. These programs are the only thing keeping the illusion of a normal economy alive. To give you a sense of what I mean (keep in mind that real numbers are likely much worse than reported statistics) Despite talk of recovery, U.S. poverty levels have hit all time highs. Over 50 million Americans are below the official poverty line. (Source) In 2009, food stamp enrollment stood at around 32 million Americans. Today that number has grown to around 48 million; a 50% increase in only 5 years. (Source) The number of citizens on federal disability is at record highs, climbing to almost 9 million people, and has expanded every month for the past 192 months. (Source) Requests for emergency food assistance are on the rise in most cities across the country, and homeless numbers continue to climb. (Source) Now ask yourself this: How many people in this country rely on government money for most if not all of their survival needs? Without government funding, and without the fiat printing press at the Federal Reserve to feed that funding, the veil of financial recovery fades away, not just in the stock market, but everywhere. All the poverty that has remained hidden for the past five years will suddenly be visible on our streets and doorsteps. Welfare programs to individuals and to states ARE the modern day soup lines. When they go, those reliant on them have nowhere to turn. Already, homeless shelters in numerous states are suffering from funding shortfalls and many are closing their doors: http://bangordailynews.com/2012/12/10/news/midcoast/midcoasts-only-homeless-shelter-abruptly-closes-no-reason-given/ http://www.khou.com/news/Woman-seeks-help-as-her-southwest-Houston-homeless-shelter-faces-closure177795891.html Food Banks are stricken with heavy demand and a dwindling supply. Interestingly, government cuts to food bank spending are being blamed on high food prices due to the latest drought. No mention of inflation caused by dollar devaluation, of course: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/21/us-usa-hunger-holiday-idUSBRE8AK08Q20121121 The lesson here is that no one, not even the government, has the ability to spend their way out of debt. And no one, including central bankers, has the ability to cure economic collapse by printing money out of thin air. But the bankers already know this. The Fed is discussing QE reductions in the face of a burgeoning recovery, but they know as well as you and I that the fundamentals show no economic improvement whatsoever. Why else would they manipulate the stock market with fiat stimulus? Why else would they manipulate bond markets with fiat stimulus? Why else would they keep interest rates at near zero and throw essentially free money at international banks? Because this is their only means of hiding the reality they know to be true. Why would they suddenly decide to reduce QE when they KNOW that the result will be the fast moving exposure of true instability with the U.S.? There are two reasons that I would make such a move if I were them: First, they have done this song and dance before; allowing markets to dive in the face of a prospective end to stimulus, and then jumping in to save the day with even larger fiat injections. The Feds decision to spread the rumor of QE cuts just before the government is to decide on austerity measures and the debt ceiling is no accident. The combination of Fed cuts and government cuts may be a deliberate effort to create a shock event that leads to the next stage of U.S. implosion. Government cuts and party conflict (fake party conflict) will provide cover for the real cause of destabilization; the Feds shut down of the fiat life support machine. The masses blame the lack of government compromise, and the Fed moves back in later with even more overwhelming QE measures, slowing the crisis slightly. Second, the Fed and the globalists at the seat of our government may very well be preparing the populace for a default scenario. Central banks around the world have been purchasing record amounts of gold, and establishing bilateral trade agreements that remove the dollar as the world reserve currency. They are undoubtedly getting ready for extreme devaluation in the U.S. dollar. If QE is cut, or restricted to the point where debt obligations cannot be maintained, then this is exactly what will happen. Again, government indecision and partisan debate will be blamed for the disaster while the Fed remains the innocent bystander who tried to warn us all of what would happen The propaganda message sent to the public is: Government decentralization is going to destroy you. Politics must be centralized and streamlined and checks and balances must be removed if you are to survive. Politicians are unqualified to handle economic policy because they care too much about the opinions of citizens, who are too stupid to understand economic policy. All fiscal decisions should be handled by the banking elite without interference so that they can remain objective. The American economy is in need of a complete overhaul, and the American people need to hand over their economic sovereignty if they wish to continue any semblance of a comfortable living standard.

"Privacy Groups to Present Oral Argument in NSA Spying Case on Nov. 4Court Should Rule That Mass Telephone Records Collection Is Unconstitutional in Klayman v. Obama The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will appear before a federal appeals court next week to argue the National Security Agency (NSA) should be barred from its mass collection of telephone records of million of Americans. The hearing in Klayman v. Obama is set for 9:30 am on Tuesday, Nov. 4 in Washington, D.C. Appearing as an amicus, EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn will present oral argument at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on behalf of EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which submitted a joint brief in the case. Conservative activist and lawyer Larry Klayman filed the suit in the aftermath of the first Edward Snowden disclosure, in which The Guardian revealed how the NSA was collecting telephone records on a massive scale from the telecommunications company Verizon. In December, District Court Judge Richard Leon issued a preliminary injunction in the case, declaring that the mass surveillance program was likely unconstitutional. EFF argues that the call-records collection, which the NSA conducts with claimed authority under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, violates the Fourth Amendment rights of millions of Americans. Separately, EFF is counsel in two other lawsuits against the programJewel v. NSA and First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSAand is co-counsel with the ACLU in a third, Smith v. Obama.

"Calling the practice a proven method for keeping players engaged, several Nevada casinos confirmed this week they often tell patrons that the rest of civilization has been obliterated in a worldwide catastrophic event and that the gambling facilities contain the last vestiges of humanity left on earth. Whenever our security cameras spot someone empty their last cup of quarters or walk away from a gaming table, we send an employee over to inform them that society as we know it no longer exists and that the world beyond our lobby is an uninhabitable wasteland, Luxor general manager Paul Milton said, adding that they typically soften the blow by offering customers a complimentary drink or free tickets to see Criss Angel. Its surprising how quickly most people will return to the casino floor once theyve been told that everyone theyve ever cared about has been vaporized in an inescapable cataclysm and that our walls are their only shield against deadly radiation. In fact, for the slots players, you can barely get two words out about humankinds downfall before theyve turned around and started hurrying back to the machines. For less compliant patrons, Milton added that the casino will typically throw in a free night in its hotel while they decide if they want to stay and gamble or venture out and take their chances with The Horde.

"In a nationally televised speech Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama altered his vision of a unified America to exclude Dayton, OH loser Nate Walsh. According to Obama, the 32-year-old Walsh, who has lived with his parents intermittently since receiving his associate's degree in 2001 and still does not have a credit card in his own name, no longer figures into the senator's long-term plan of rallying Americans from all walks of life around a common, higher purpose. 'People of South Carolina, people of the world, this is our time, this is our moment,' Obama said before 72,000 supporters at the University of South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium. 'That is, unless you live in apartment 3L at 1254 Holden St., you watched Money Train on TBS last night at 3 a.m., and your name is Nate Walsh.' An excerpt from Obama's speech draws on his message of unity-minus-one. 'I have always said that the change we seek will not come easy, that it will not come without its share of sacrifice and struggle,' Obama continued. 'And the last thing we need is dead weight like Nate Walsh adding another 20 or 30 years to the process.' The speech, entitled 'A More Perfect Union Minus Nate Walsh,' was 26 minutes long and contained the words 'change' 12 times, 'hope' 16 times, and 'Nate,' in conjunction with the phrase 'with the exception of,' 34 times. Although Obama remained vague on issues such as health care and foreign policy, the Illinois senator was praised for finally publicly addressing the issue of Nate Walsh. Obama took a hard-line stance on Walsh, calling the part-time driving-range employee the lone aspect of America he doesn't believe in, a citizen who can languish in the past for all he cares, and 'on top of everything else, kind of a jerk.' 'When I began this campaign, my mission was to help this nation share my vision for one Americanot a black America, or a white America, or a Latino or Asian America,' Obama said. 'But now what I see, what I envision, is a Nate-free America. And once we get rid of that guy, there is nothing we can't accomplish. Nothing we can't achieve.' According to campaign strategist David Axelrod, Walsh's failure to remember his mother's birthday five years in a row, along with the fact that for the entire month of July he washed his hair with a bar of soap because he was too lazy to purchase shampoo, are examples of the kind of hopelessness Obama is trying to avoid. 'I am reminded of an instance early last year when Nate told his sister, Elizabeth, that he was going to start going to the gym three times a week after work,' Obama said. 'I was rooting for Nate. I thought that this time things would be different. That this time Nate would be capable of change. But it was just like 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2002 all over again. He went to the gym twice and quit.' 'What a loser,' Obama added. In the hours following the speech, members of the McCain camp scrambled to respond to Obama's views on Walsh. In a statement last night, McCain applauded Obama's position on the loser, but criticized him for not offering any real solutions to the Nate Walsh problem. McCain went on to promise that, if elected, he would rid the world of Walsh within his first 48 hours in office without raising taxes. Perhaps the most stirring moment of Obama's speech came at its conclusion, when he reasserted his call for change on the part of everyone except Walsh, whom he urged to just change the channel to the Golden Girls marathon on Lifetime like he knows he wants to. 'People of America, not Nate, we have the ability to heal this nation,' Obama said. 'Yes we can, Nate excluded, seize our future. Yes we can, with the exception of Nate and his stupid cargo shorts that he never washes, turn the page to a new tomorrow. I am confident that where weand by 'we' I mean everyone but Nateare met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we can't, weagain, not Natewill respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the American people in six simple words: Yes we can, except Nate Walsh.' Added Obama: 'God bless the people of South Carolina, God bless America, and fuck you, Nate.' ",0
"Reflections on Standing Rock -- Who is the Perpetrator, Who is the Protester?By Janet Phelan The orchid reserve is close to a busy highway. The silence observed worldwide as an hour of solidarity with the Standing Rock water protectors was punctuated with the noise of cars and motorcycles less than fifty yards away. That would be petroleum fueled cars and motorbikes, like those which transported us to the meditation session. And the small group, ten or eleven Mexicans and Americans, also brought food and water to share. That would be water in plastic bottles, a petroleum product. So while we sat and chanted and sang in communion with the brave and imperiled community in Standing Rock, we also participated in the very sorts of behaviors which have fueled (no pun intended) the dependence on petroleum and its byproducts. You cant call us hypocrites. The reality is more complex than that. Every person who attended the meditation in San Cristobal has deep and abiding ties to both worlds the world of concern and activism and the world of consumerism which relies so heavily on the very oil that Standing Rock does not want piped through its land. We drive. We leave the market with plastic bags laden with food. One of the women attending the convocation has a husband who works on a pipeline in Alaska. And I suspect that many of those in Standing Rock also maintain a level of relationship with petroleum. We could have been doing penance. Couldnt we? In the guise of heartfelt support for the protesters at Standing Rock we could actually have been in a kind of confessional, where our own complicity first breaks into awareness. We could actually have been taking the first steps toward purification. Not in hair shirts, not with self flagellation, but by dipping into a global hour of prayer and support, we could possibly have begun the necessary steps toward reflection on how we too have fed a mechanized monster which only demands more more fuel, more energy, more stuff. I was not the only one in the San Cristobal group who was struck by this paradox. As we were gathering our things to leave the orchid garden, another woman commented on this subtext to the event. A worldwide movement towards understanding and confronting how we have unknowingly and unthinkingly colluded in creating this omnivorous need for More may have sparked in other groups, as well. If other communities, in other nations and cities and states, who gathered to support the protesters at Standing Rock, were also struck with their own complicity then maybe the planetary hour of solidarity might have had an unexpected outcome. Coming to terms with our own engagement with that which we profess to abhor is the very first step towards overcoming it. Nothing that takes place after the breakthrough into awareness will be easy. But nothing can ever change before that breakthrough occurs.

"New 3D Printing Tech Lowers Cost of Producing Items at HomeBy Kevin Samson But for 3D printing to transform the lives of everyday individuals, the cost of high-quality 3D printers that can produce useful items still needs to drop dramatically. While this has steadily been happening, the cost is still greatly prohibitive for most people. A new technique is being studied at the University of Bristol, UK that takes us one step closer to producing useful items right from our homes while making a quantum leap in providing low-cost access to many more people. Researchers have uncovered a way to harness ultrasonic waves to form a microstructure that adds strength and range to the items that can be produced. The study published in Smart Materials and Structures creates and demonstrates a novel method in which ultrasonic waves are used to carefully position millions of tiny reinforcement fibres as part of the 3D printing process. The fibres are formed into a microscopic reinforcement framework that gives the material strength. This microstructure is then set in place using a focused laser beam, which locally cures the epoxy resin and then prints the object. Best of all, this technology is housed in a small module that can be mounted on a standard, low-cost 3D printer, turning it into a much more complex composite printer that is currently seen only at much higher price points at the industrial scale. Tom Llewellyn-Jones, a PhD student in advanced composites who developed the system, said: We have demonstrated that our ultrasonic system can be added cheaply to an off-the-shelf 3D printer, which then turns it into a composite printer. . This approach allows the realisation of complex fibrous architectures within a 3D printed object. The versatile nature of the ultrasonic manipulation technique also enables a wide-range of particle materials, shapes and sizes to be assembled, leading to the creation of a new generation of fibrous reinforced composites that can be 3D printed. Researchers note that this technique will enable people at home to print high-performance products, rather than the current novelty items that are more project-based for those inclined to tinkering. Think sporting equipment and replacement parts for a range of electronics though they also cite airplanes as an illustration of the true complexity that can be generated by using this new technology. The key to understanding the significance of 3D printing is that it offers the power of creativity to more individuals. When this happens, we can begin decentralizing industries that have monopolized technology and imposed high prices through lack of competition. Imagine how healthcare alone could be self-directed instead of being the imposed financial burden that it has become. The barriers that could be broken down in housing, manufacturing and education will be limited only by our imagination. If enough people gain the knowledge about the level of freedom that new technologies are offering, a much more positive future appears to be easily within our reach.

"The Dome brought you the first look at the new rules for basketball, designed by Heat superstars Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade and LeBron James who were reportedly 'sick of playing basketball the stupid way.' But while they've gotten a lot of buzz for replacing shot clocks with strobe lights, putting lions in luxury boxes and making every team eat a whole pizza at halftime, the new rules go further than that. The selfnews Sports Network obtained the original proposal sent to the NBA and immediately ratified by commissioner David Stern who still has not bothered to read them. Check out more of the new rules, written by Bosh, Wade and James, and illustrated by Bosh. Bosh came up with Rule 8, which allows for the use of ziplines players can ride right to the basket, after learning that rocket shoes were not feasible. For the handful of teams that weren't disbanded because they sucked or had a stupid logo Lebron didn't like, their best chance of making the postseason is to find the buried treasure chest on Slam Dunk Island that's worth 20 wins and an automatic playoff bid.

"West Spreads Lies of Syrian WMDs to Justify Another War of AggressionTony Cartalucci, Contributor Despite this, the Western media has begun the all too familiar WMD-mantra, heard in the lead up to Iraq, where bald-faced lies and fabrications based on knowingly dubious intelligence sources, were picked specifically to tell the narrative the West sought to sell the public. The culmination of this propaganda campaign versus the government and people of Iraq, of whom over 2 million died between sanctions leading up to the war and the Wests invasion and occupation, was the Wests primary intelligence source, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed Curveball, admitting that I had the chance to fabricate something to topple the regime. In other words, as the Guardian puts it in the title of their article, Defector admits to WMD lies that triggered Iraq war. Now in Syria, we have another defector, the discredited, former-Syrian ambassador to Iraq, Nawaf Fares. Fares is clearly fabricating fantastical tales to both undermine the Syrian government, and give the West the impetus it needs for wider military intervention especially since NATOs proxy Free Syrian Army has suffered catastrophic defeats in both Damascus, and now Aleppo. Fares claimed that he knew Syrias weapons were being mobilized, and that the government planned on using them. It is believed that NATO and the Gulf States FSA terrorist proxies have reached the very limit of their ability to destabilize Syria and the West recognizes the necessity of limited strikes to cripple a Syrian government that remains intact, coherent, and far from crumbling as the Western media has tried, but failed to portray. Veteran Indian diplomat, M K Bhadrakumar, wrote as much in his most recent analysis titled, The rise and fall of Turkeys Erdogan. However, a pretext for such strikes must be fabricated and there have been stark warnings from analysts and international press from around the world of a possible false-flag chemical weapons attack staged by NATO and its proxies to be then blamed on the Syrian government, and give NATO, Israel, and the Gulf States the impetus theyve sought for a wider military intervention. The hysterical rhetoric coming from the West is directly proportional to the failing fortunes of their terrorist proxies on the ground across Syria. After a year and a half of trying to undermine the Syrian government and its people, only but a collection of towns sheltered by the Turkish military along the border lie in FSA hands, with their attacks repeatedly fended off across the country and the tide of public opinion worldwide turning against them. The West is still paying the price for its lies leading up to the condemned invasion and occupation of Iraq, but seems prepared to reach further yet into the depths of its own depravity. Spread the word and remind the public of the outcome when last the West told tales of WMDs, real or imagined, to justify a war of aggression.

"Following a discussion of the Detroit Lions with a potential customer Monday, Kwik-Kool Heating & Air Conditioning sales representative Kevin Resnick mentioned that he played a little football back in college. Sales rep Kevin Resnick, 36, admits to having 'tossed the pigskin around a bit.' 'Speaking of football, I used to toss the pigskin around a bit myself,' the 36-year-old told Little Red Barn Plush Toys CEO Grant Nussbaum, who was looking into a Kwik-Kool heat and air system for his new factory. 'Yup, played two full seasons at Central Michigan. I was a walk-on as a freshman, but by sophomore year, I practically had a full ride.' During the one-hour meeting at Little Red Barn's Livonia headquarters, Nussbaum learned that Resnick played defensive back at CMU for two years, but blew out his right knee in May 1983. 'It was the annual spring intrasquad game, between my sophomore and junior year, and on the very first play from scrimmage I tore my ACL,' Resnick told the toy manufacturer. 'And that pretty much ended that.' 'I still remember those practices,' said Resnick, unfolding a glossy Kwik-Kool brochure. 'Coach Meijer would put us through hell, pardon my French. The first week of training camp, we'd run 10 miles in full pads every morning and then cool down with something easy, like, oh, 25 windsprints. And even us guys who weren't starters had to do the full thing. It was insane.' 'But it was a good experience,' Resnick added. 'Meijer was a tough bastard, but he taught me a lot about life.' Mark Meijer, retired but still living in Mt. Pleasant near the CMU campus, said he could not recall Resnick specifically, but noted that 'all of [his] players were good, solid boys.' 'I've put on a few pounds since then, of course,' said Resnick, patting his growing paunch. 'But I do try to get out and shoot some hoops now and then, and I play in the company's volleyball league every summer.' According to Resnick, 'keeping physically active is the key to staying mentally active.' Throughout his 11 years at Kwik-Kool, he has had the opportunity to share such bits of wisdom with coworkers, heating-and-cooling-industry suppliers, and Kwik-Kool clients, whom he frequently treats to expenses-paid lunches at local taverns. 'Those were some of the best years of my life,' Resnick said during one such three-hour meeting at J.T. McBleacher's Sports Pub with Denkinger Lanes owner Russ Denkinger, who was considering a new air-conditioning system for his bowling alley. 'Being out there under the lights during a big game, everyone cheeringwhat a high. Of course, I only saw a few minutes of game timeit was a very seasoned team. But you should have seen that locker room after a win. Man, that was brotherhood.' Denkinger ultimately decided not to purchase a system from Resnick. Despite his reminiscing, Resnick is anything but living in the past, and is 'extremely excited' about his future with Kwik-Kool, a fast-growing company that has doubled its revenues over the last decade and has plans to branch out with offices as far away as Fort Wayne, IN, in the next 18 months. 'I've got a great lifea beautiful wife, two great kids, and a new 21-foot Sea Ray,' said Resnick, pulling a picture of the motorboat from his wallet. 'I'm pretty much right on track in terms of the goals I've set and where I wanted to see myself at 35.' Though he has not yet been tapped for any management positions at the company, Resnick did sell the most units in the third quarter of 1995, an achievement that earned him Kwik-Kool 'Sales Star Of The Month' honors for September of that year. 'Kevin may not be our star player, but he's a very important member of the Kwik-Kool team,' said Dale Rindfleisch, Kwik-Kool regional manager and starting third baseman for George Mason University from 1983 to 1985. 'To succeed in business, as in sports, you need more than great startersyou also need a solid bench.' ",0
"For people who choose educating others over enriching themselves, college debt can seem insurmountable â€” because it is insurmountable. To cultivate a well-educated, globally competitive American work force, we must make college affordable.The American Federation of Teachers recently started a series of student debt clinics to help our members mitigate the crippling college debt incurred by millions of American students and their families. In 90-minute sessions, these clinics provide information on how to enroll in income-based student loan repayment programs and to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. For some participants, the clinics have been life-changing.The A.F.T. is fighting on the front lines â€” warning students and their families about the risks of predatory behaviors by servicers, lenders and for-profit educational providers, educating them on repayment options and cultivating a new generation of activists who have the potential to halt this national student debt epidemic.In October, a young adjunct professor from Miami attended a two-part A.F.T. debt clinic. Crushed by more than $168,000 in student loan debt and monthly payments exceeding $2,000, this professor, a single mother, was desperate. On the first day of the training, she kept to herself. That night, she applied for income-based repayment and was able to reduce her monthly payment to $700. On the second day of the training, she told the group that it was the first good nightâ€™s sleep sheâ€™d had in three years. She is now a trainer herself, helping others better understand how to relieve their debt.The economic and professional advantages of earning a college degree are well established. And a highly educated work force is essential to the nationâ€™s economic future. But many people simply canâ€™t afford to seek higher education, or they pay dearly when they do. Forty-seven states are spending less per student than they did at the start of the recession, after adjusting for inflation. As a result, tuition costs have skyrocketed, putting more of the burden on students and their families.These debt clinics help alleviate the costs of attending college, but the clinics alone do not make college accessible to all Americans. When our country realized the value of educating all students through high school, we made high school universally free. The same should be done for college today.Our country needs a comprehensive plan â€” one like Hillary Clintonâ€™s New College Compact â€” that addresses all the flaws in this broken system. (Bernie Sanders has also called for free tuition). Mrs. Clintonâ€™s plan ensures that students can attend a four-year public college without loans for tuition, books or fees, and can attend community college completely tuition-free. It gives states incentives to reinvest in higher education to reduce costs for students. It cuts interest rates on student loans, and it makes income-based repayment simple and broadly available.The men and women who teach in our public schools, colleges and universities have invested in their own education so that they can, in turn, invest in the students in their classrooms. They know they wonâ€™t be rewarded with huge paychecks, but neither should they be punished with crushing college debt.",1
"Artificial Intelligence Takes the Battlefield: Who Is Really Running Jade Helm 15?By Aaron and Melissa Dykes There is more to the story than just training for martial law in states designated as hostile states already a chilling pretext with overtones of greater federal power that could spiral out of control. But it seems that it is actually A.I. artificial intelligence that is at the helm of an enormous and unprecedented military drill. A scary thought for sure but what does it really mean? If analysts are correct, it seems that JADE is an acronym for a DARPA-developed A.I.quantum computing technology that produces holographic battlefield simulations and will be in charge of the drill in order to master the human domain and predict human response. Level 9 News, who appeared in the above interview with John B. Wells, gave a 38-minute YouTube presented about what exactly she has uncovered concerning JADE Helm as an artificial intelligence exercise talk about adding layers of meaning to the 2015 Bilderberg discussion of A.I! Read more: Bilderberg Wields Artificial Intelligence: A Tool to Massively Amplify Our Ability to Control the World Level 9 News wrote under the header Rise of the Machine that: RISE OF THE MACHINE JADE is an A.I. quantum computing technology that produces holographic battlefield simulations and has the ability to use vast amounts of data being collected on the human domain to generate human terrain systems in geographic population centric locations to identify and eliminate targets, insurgents, rebels or whatever labels that can be flagged as targets in a Global Information Grid for Network Centric Warfare environments. The JADE II battle field system is cognitive and intuitive. It can examine prior executed battle plans and and devise new and better strategies to increase the kill chain. The II generation of JADE has the capability for two way communication with drones through the OCCOM technology which is one of the next generation integrations to this system. In short, JADE HELM will not be battles directed by Generals and Military Commanders, but by a computer. It is a cognitive software program based on a Network Centric Warfare System at the HELM. The rapid weaponization of drones with thousands now taking over skies was just the beginning. Along with coordinated efforts with human military teams, the A.I. computers are already being rolled out for the battlefield. In a short time, weaponized robots will join them, and autonomous, learning, thinking computers will thereafter put humans out of the loop of decision making and take lives into their own hands. This document (PDF) describes a military A.I. strategy that fits this view of JADE Helm including an AI program named JADE II. Whatever the full scope, these future trends for conflict and population control should be closely monitored. Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton Dykes created TruthstreamMedia.com, where this article first appeared, as an outlet to examine the news, uncover the deceptions, pierce through the fabric of illusions, know the real enemy, unshackle from the system, and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives, one step at a time, so that one day we might truly be free I admit, I AM concerned, but I must always step back from info like this and remember that good ALWAYS wins and not be afraid. If everybody gets one of them if they attack our homes or whatever, they will stop. I am planning to do just that. No death camp for me. I choose vaporization over prison/slavery/torture. Hacked through the smart meter twice and one time there was no storm, Maybe there is water inside of the electric meter from the many storms we recently had so called OG@eE TO come and check for a short. on suggestion of the phone company as we get our Internet through them and both are right together on the same outside wall. and all it takes is the lights to flicker and we lose internet connection and have to reset things. Once for 4 hours. in sunshine. I had called the phone company asking if there was some form of shield to put between the two boxes on the house so that the signals would not cross each other if that was what was going on. ON THE OTHER HAND MAYBE WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING JADE 15 EXERCISES AS WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF SOME AREAS. BUT WILL CHECK OUT RAIN WATER FIRST. Linda Joy Adams So they want to predict human response? No need for a gigantic battlefield simulation to learn that, just watch this video: https://youtu.be/meiU6TxysCg We dont like being jerked around and cheated, so were throwing our cucumbers just like the capuchin monkeys in the experiment. Transferring control of the military response to legitimate human anger at how were being treated is the psychopaths way of getting around compassion and empathy in the normal humans hired to maintain control in an unfair system. In other words, there arent enough psychopaths to maintain control for the psychopaths. That should tell you something about who holds the real power. ",0
"EU regulators: Google privacy policy has legal irregularities and may not be in compliance with lawMadison Ruppert, Contributor U.S. Senator Charles Schumer previously called for an investigation into this privacy policy to be carried out by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) although any such investigation would be questionable at best. Seeing as Google has such a tight relationship with the United States government and was cleared of wrongdoing by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) related to their spying on Americans, any investigation carried out by an American government entity would likely be laughable. However, the European Unions data protection and privacy regulators have stepped up to the plate, challenging the legality of the new integrated Google privacy policy. The French Commission Nationale de lInformatique et des Libertes (CNIL) was tasked with the investigation. Representatives of CNIL noted in a press conference that users are forced to agree to Googles new privacy policy while users should be given the choice to opt-out of the policy. Of course Googles response to such challenges is, essentially, that users can simply opt out of using their services entirely if they have a problem with their new policies. The CNIL representatives said that the new Google privacy policy has legal irregularities and indeed may not actually be in compliance with EU law. Furthermore, they argue that the scope of Googles policy is too wide and that the company should give users more control over their personal data. Among other recommendations, the CNIL suggested Google should strengthen the consent sought for combining data for the purposes of service improvement and advertising; provide a centralized opt-out solution; and adapt the combination rules to distinguish between security and advertising, according to CNET. They also pointed out that Google does not make it clear how long they retain user data for. None of this is surprising and honestly I think most of the recommendations will not be implemented because Googles business is, in fact, data mining. Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, CNIL president, stated that Google has not demonstrated its commitment to the European Data Protection Directives principles. The European Data Protection Directive governs data transfer and storage laws in all 27 states that are members of the European Union. In anticipation of what will likely be a common objection to the CNILs recommendations, she pointed out that it is not the goal to declare war on Google and stifle innovation, but they are still dedicated to reminding Google of its responsibilities. Unfortunately, the CNIL stopped far short of demanding what some sources claimed they would. On October 15, 2012 the British Guardian reported that Google would be told by EU to unravel data policy according to their sources, but that obviously did not happen. Not only did they fall far short of actually calling on Google to unravel their privacy policy, they also said that they will give Google three to four months to follow their recommendations. We have received the report and are reviewing it now, said Peter Fleischer, Googles global privacy counsel. Our new privacy policy demonstrates our long-standing commitment to protecting our users information and creating great products. We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law. Interestingly, EU regulators actually brought up similar concerns about Googles new privacy policy before it actually became active on March 1 of this year. At the time, Google called the EUs concerns a surprise and went ahead with the implementation of their privacy policy anyway. The regulars are calling on Google to seek explicit consent from users when combining their data across the various Google services, which is the exact opposite of what Google did previously. Google simply implemented the policy and told users that they either would agree or close their account. It will be quite interesting to see if and how Google complies with the EU regulators recommendations.

"Do We Have a Right to Internet Privacy or an Obligation to Disclosure?S. Paul Forrest Though these actions do stir the mind of anyone wishing our nation was more just and our freedoms werent being ripped apart one by one by nationalistic paranoia and religious revivalism, if one spends a moment to consider the issue in full, a few questions arise that beg to be answered: Do we actually have a right to privacy in a public forum and should we fight to protect said freedom, or should we be willingly allowing and supporting the efforts of our government to watch us for the sake of National Security? These questions came to mind after reading a post on my own Facebook page concerning a petition drive entitled, Tell the ITU: The Internet Belongs to Us. The petition asks that we all stand against the International Telecommunications Unions plan to control the Internet. These plans reportedly include giving countries full control over the information and communication infrastructure within their state and license to inspect private e-mail. Fees have also been suggested which would limit our ability to access sites like Google and Facebook. The site asks readers to sign the petition to stop the Union from controlling our avenues of communication. Whether it would help in any way to sign said petition is a matter for conjecture, but the issue is disturbing nonetheless. The first reaction most freedom-loving people have to this reality is one of frustration. They are not terrorists so why are they being watched and why is information being controlled or kept from them? To members of a nation concerned about their government leaning toward an ever-increasing Police State, any move to control and contain our increasing dissatisfaction with their form of representation, causes great concern. After all, we are supposed to be a free nation, right? We are supposed to be a Democratic Republic, represented by a government for the people; not against them. In places like Syria or North Korea, one would expect a certain amount of censorship, but now that America is adopting the same intrusive policies, the reality of our devolving into a lesser system of rule has become apparent. The sad truth is, any paranoid government which fears backlash from its own actions would monitor its people to keep them from protesting said action. Given Americas military policies of the past eleven years, expecting our government to not embrace the policy of monitoring We the People for the protection and proliferation of their militaristic rule, is nave at best. Welcome to Reality Try as you might to convince yourself that the Internet is ours, the reality isquite the opposite. The Internet is wholly owned by corporations through which our ability to search topics, interact with each other electronically and perform our jobs, is channeled. It is not a private entity where if our messages are read we have somehow become victims of intrusion into our private lives. Comments and activities within this corporate arena are essentially owned, and therefore are open to sharing and censorship by those who control the site. Though it is upsetting to think postings are being used to profile users, the reality is that we have no right to privacy within a public forum. Posting words or articles on social media and expecting them to stay private is akin to standing in a public square, yelling out obscenities but thinking only your friends across the way can hear you. It would seem that We the People may have lost our perspective in the areas of privacy and information disclosure. After all, never before in the history of mankind has the global community been so interconnected or informed of governmental and societal goings on as we are now, nor have we ever had such diversity of media sources to gather information from. Not until the technological revolution of the 1990s did we even have widespread access to the Internet, e-mail or 290 channels on the television. When the Internet became popular, we gained a new perspective; a new freedom of information. Before that time, our news was isolated to papers, radio and a few news channels. The information revolution via the Internet and an ever-expanding news media has changed that, quite significantly. With violence raging across the globe, maybe we should be accepting and welcoming the monitoring of our sites and e-mails to assist our government and help them find those who would commit acts of hate here in America. If stronger monitoring had been in place, Representative Gabriel Gifford and others may not have been shot in Arizona. Her assailant posted his planned actions days before he committed his crime. The Columbine teens did the same, and one could argue that if stronger monitoring had been in place, 9/11 would have been foiled (maybe wink, wink). Given copycat criminals and media serving as idea wells for them to follow in the footsteps of the truly violent, maybe we should be supporting Internet spying and censorship instead of fighting it. For the sake of argument, just imagine what would happen if there was complete secrecy on the net as so many insist should exist: If a bomb went off in a downtown somewhere in America and your children were in the blast zone, would you not be among the first to shout out as so many did post-9/11, insisting that the government should have been aware it was going to happen and acted to stop it? But then again, there is the question of whether we should have some form of privacy or even, protection from unconstitutional laws like indefinite detention where words spoken in frustration could be used to wrongly accuse a person of plotting against the State and without charges, be held as the title suggests; indefinitely. Power Corrupts As seen of late, the U.S. government does not operate as We the People think it should or wished it did. The concept of Big Brother watching us in an Orwellian fashion has become all too real, but the truth is that Law Makers and those in the Pentagon, CIA and FBI who operate outside of the Law, are afraid of our connectedness. They say they are imposing these intrusive laws only to protect our nation from terrorism (which more correctly should be called retaliation) when the truth of the matter is that they are afraid of uprisings right here in America by those of us who are aware of the broken economic and legislative system which they created. As has been said, Power corrupts and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely. With the institution of the PATRIOT Act and National Security Act, SOPA, CISPA, CIA special operations and a Police State intended to dissuade any movement against the in-place oligarchy; our freedom has become a matter of perspective which is swiftly becoming myopic in the dusk of global, governmental control over our nation. In an ideal world ruled by the just, some monitoring would be acceptable to preserve our nations against those who would do us harm; but anytime one gives a corrupt system power to pry into their lives, those entrenched within the bowels of its offices will always want more and more until all fundamental freedoms of privacy become a distant memory, and corruption takes the place of representation. We the People have always had the wonderful ideal of freedom in the past. Now, though, we are living in an increasingly dense collective. Given the inherent characteristics of population growth, violence and moral degradation, in conjunction with overcrowding and resource stresses, it would follow that an increased police force to control the violence in this crowded population would grow in conjunction with it. As evidenced of late, it has certainly done that. Sadly, in order to protect against threats to our national security, we are being asked to commit something of ourselves to the cause; something dear to our very national being. Our government created the problem of the terrorist attacks in New York and continues to further endanger us all with drone attacks against those who are only protecting their homelands overseas, but since we cannot control their brutality and obvious lack of consideration for blowback, we must do what we can here to protect our families from terrorism. The reality is, though, that these so called terrorists are the effects of an immoral system that no longer represents anything save for the Military-Industrial Complex and greed. We must, unfortunately, go along with the paranoid state of our nation if only to protect ourselves from our governments international reign of terror of which we no longer have control, right? An international cabal wanting to tax the Internet overseas which inevitably cuts off global connectedness, increasing paranoia by governments operating against their people and a global awakening to the realities of our planet being destroyed by greed have all combined to form a wave of desperate action by governments everywhere in order to maintain power over the people they are misrepresenting. The Internet has made all of this possible. It has brought us to a sense of power; a power the global corporacrats want to take away at any cost. We the Global People have for far too long been disparaged by the few and we are gaining strength toward a global revolution. They who stand against us know this all too well. If they didnt, there would not be such efforts being taken by them to rein us back in. This article first appeared at AmericaRevealed.com Read other articles by S. Paul Forrest HERE.

"The line to get in stretched around the block and deep into a hotel parking lot. Thousands of people had turned up to an election campaign event in Medicine Hat, a small Albertan city in Canadaâ€™s conservative heartland, hoping to catch a glimpse of Justin Trudeau.    Related: Think Canada is a progressive paradise? Thatâ€™s mooseshit   About 800 of them made it inside, cheering wildly as Trudeau spoke of first visiting the city with his father when he was just seven months old. Later, the Liberal party leader waded into the crowd outside, shaking hands and snapping selfies with admirers among the 1,600 or so people who had teemed around loudspeakers to hear his speech. The boisterous welcome came not during the election campaign which swept Trudeau to power, nor during the heady days after he assumed office 12 months ago â€“ it took place during a local byelection last month, and offers a snapshot of an extraordinary political honeymoon that has come to define Trudeauâ€™s first year in office. â€œThis is really uncharted territory,â€ said Nik Nanos of Nanos Research. â€œIn my 20 years of experience, no one has had a one-year honeymoon.â€     Justin Trudeau speaking in Montreal. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images   Others question whether honeymoon is the appropriate word to capture what exactly is going on. â€œHoneymoons last maybe a month or two, maybe three â€“ but not a year. This is something else,â€ said Frank Graves of EKOS Research Associates. â€œCertainly in the time Iâ€™ve been polling â€“ which is a pretty long time â€“ Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this.â€  Friday marks one year since Trudeau took power in Canada. The 44-year-old former high school teacher and snowboarding instructor swept into parliament at the helm of a majority government, after campaigning on an ambitious manifesto which promised to take bold action on climate change, revive the countryâ€™s sluggish economy and reset the countryâ€™s relationship with indigenous peoples.   This is really uncharted territory. In my 20 years of experience, no one has had a one-year honeymoon  Nik Nanos, public opinion researcher    During the election campaign, his team racked up 219 promises that seemingly offered something for everyone. So far, 34 of these promises have been fulfilled and 64 are in progress. In their first year, the government has unmuzzled government scientists, ended Canadaâ€™s airstrikes against Isis and brought in 33,239 Syrian refugees, among other actions. It hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing; Trudeau and his government have been disparaged by indigenous people who continue to feel sidelined from decision making and Green voters who wonder why the government has adopted the carbon cutting targets of its predecessors. Revelations of fundraisers offering access to cabinet ministers for up to $1,500 a ticket have sparked questions about government transparency while at a youth labour forum last week, dozens of delegates turned their backs to Trudeau , heckling him to honour his promises on pipelines and tackling youth unemployment.     Justin Trudeau in a ceremonial headdress while visiting the Tsuutâ€™ina First Nation near Calgary, Alberta. Photograph: Jeff McIntosh/AP   But most see these as small knocks for a government that has political capital to spare. Polls routinely suggest that were an election to be held today, Trudeau and his party would earn an even greater number of seats than the 184 won last year in Canadaâ€™s 338-seat House of Commons. â€œThe reality is that they are very different from the previous government,â€ said Nanos. The Trudeau governmentâ€™s popularity is hard to untangle from the divisiveness that dogged his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, whose government shunned climate change obligations, slashed funding to federal efforts on gender equality and sought to ban women wearing the niqab from participating in citizenship ceremonies.  At the outset of last yearâ€™s election campaign, it was clear voters were looking for change. Many of Trudeauâ€™s actions so far â€“ from launching a long-awaited inquiry into the thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women to implementing gender parity in his cabinet â€“ have sought to demonstrate they are enacting the change they promised. Some of Trudeauâ€™s strength can also be explained by the weakness of the countryâ€™s major opposition parties, said Nanos. The Conservatives and the New Democratic Party are currently both lacking a permanent leader, leaving them struggling to offer a meaningful counterpoint on the right or left.  â€œThe Liberals shouldnâ€™t be too smug with the very strong numbers because theyâ€™re the only game in town right now,â€ said Nanos. Trudeauâ€™s political honeymoon, he said, could stretch well into 2017 until the two opposition parties choose new leaders.    Justin Trudeau, who once worked as a snowboarding instructor, boxes at a gym in Toronto.  Photograph: Mark Blinch/Reuters   Trudeauâ€™s popularity has endured even as his first nine months in office rank among the House of Commonsâ€™ least productive in more than two decades, according to data compiled by the library of parliament.  His government points to the myriad of consultations underway to explain the slow pace, but Canadians arenâ€™t necessarily looking for substance at this point, said Darrell Bricker of Ipsos Public Affairs. â€œWhen we ask people directly: is it more style than substance, they say â€˜yes, it is more style than substance,â€™ but theyâ€™re enjoying the style.â€ Canadians across the country regularly gather to snap selfies with the prime minister while social media gleefully shares photos of a shirtless Trudeau or as he shares an intimate moment with his wife, former television presenter Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau.  â€œHeâ€™s prime minister selfie, right?â€ Bricker said, referring to the name given to him by his critics. â€œAll of that stuff you wouldnâ€™t see Harper do â€“ for good or for bad. Itâ€™s very symbolic of the change.â€     Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie, a former television presenter. Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters   What emerges is an image of a young, dynamic and transparent government. â€œThere is just generally a lightness associated with this government as opposed to what came before it,â€ said Bricker. â€œSo if you wanted to change this is a 180-degree change from what existed before.â€    Weâ€™re consultingâ€™ will work for a while â€“ but at some point you've got to come up with some very concrete answers  Frank Graves, political analyst    The hard work starts now, he said. Details must be hashed out on the governmentâ€™s plans to legalise recreational marijuana, reform the countryâ€™s electoral system and meet its emission targets. After a year of vague promises to strike a balance between environmental protection, a limping economy and a fraught relationship with Indigenous peoples, Trudeauâ€™s government will be forced to put these pledges to the test in imminent decisions on several massive energy projects. â€œItâ€™s the first time theyâ€™re going to actually have to pick a side,â€ said Bricker.  Itâ€™s a challenge that may get a boost from an unexpected source: international media. In a country long wary of being overshadowed by its southern neighbour, Trudeau has been wholeheartedly embraced by global media who delight in his feminist views or his take on quantum physics. The international attention has helped propel his popularity at home, said Graves of EKOS Research Associates. â€œI do believe that Canadians, one of the reasons theyâ€™re so happy with the government is that they really like the way weâ€™re being seen on the world stage.â€ Itâ€™s a sharp contrast to the previous government, he said. â€œFrankly I had data showing that Canadians were ashamed and embarrassed about our image with our performance on things like climate change or our policies on Israel or moving to towards militarism.â€    Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama at the White House state dinner reception. The pair are seen as in step on key issues. Photograph: Olivier Douliery/EPA   The governmentâ€™s approval rating has persisted even as stagnation and rising inequality has given rise to Canadaâ€™s worst economic outlook in two decades, said Graves. â€œIn some respects heâ€™s sort of tapped into the same sentiment that drove Brexit and Trump but with a very different type of message â€“ instead of take back control and close the borders and build walls, letâ€™s talk about sunny ways, letâ€™s talk about a more optimistic approach.â€  The government has vowed to counter the slumping economy by pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure. Vowing to restore middle-class progress, theyâ€™ve raised taxes on the top 1% to help pay for a middle-class tax cut, as well as handed out a means tested universal child benefit. Itâ€™s an approach that will have to start delivering growth and shared prosperity soon, said Graves, or risk jeopardising the governmentâ€™s unprecedented popularity.  He likened it to the other challenges facing the government as they move into their second year, from democratic renewal to climate change.  â€œThese are really daunting challenges. So yeah, â€˜weâ€™re consultingâ€™ will work for a while â€“ but at some point youâ€™ve really got to come up with some very concrete and solid answers about how to deal with those tough problems.â€",1

"Leonardo DiCaprio is to produce and star in a film about Sam Phillips, the Memphis music producer famous for launching the careers of Elvis Presley, Ike Turner, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Paramount Pictures has acquired rights to adapt Peter Guralnickâ€™s book Sam Phillips: the Man Who Invented Rockâ€™nâ€™Roll, and has enlisted DiCaprio to co-develop it as a star vehicle for himself, according to Deadline.   Related: Before the Flood: Leonardo DiCaprio hopes his new film will inspire climate action   Mick Jagger will reportedly co-produce alongside DiCaprio. He last produced HBOâ€™s rock series Vinyl that was canceled after one season. DiCaprio has yet to lock down a writer and director for the project.  Phillips â€“ who worked as a record executive, music producer and disc jockey â€“ is credited for playing a vital role in the emergence of rockâ€™nâ€™roll in the 1950s, largely by discovering Presley.  Fridayâ€™s announcement caps off a busy week for the actor. Monday saw him reveal plans to produce a film adaptation of the 1990s childrenâ€™s cartoon show Captain Planet, about a superhero who fights pollution. On Thursday, it was reported heâ€™s nearing a deal to produce and star in an adaptation of Beth Macyâ€™s non-fiction book Truevine, about two young black brothers in the racially segregated southern US who were kidnapped and displayed as circus freaks. DiCaprio recently won his first Oscar for The Revenant. His latest project, the climate change documentary Before the Flood, which he features in and produced, just opened in US cinemas. ",1
"Is It Time To Acknowledge Roundup Herbicide As A Contraceptive?How much longer will we deny the growing body of research linking Roundup to infertility before calling this chemical a contraceptive? Following closely on the heels of the EPAs decision to allow Roundup herbicide residues in your food at concentrations a million times higher than shown carcinogenic, a concerning new study published in the journal Free Radical Medicine Biology implicates the herbicide, and its main ingredient glyphosate, in male infertility, at concentration ranges well within the EPAs safe level for food.[1] Performed by Brazilian researchers, the study found acute Roundup exposure at low doses (36ppm, 0.036g/L) for 30 minutes induced cell death in Sertoli cells in prepubertal rat testis. Sertoli cells are known as mother or nurse cells within the testicles, as they are responsible for maintaining the health of sperm cells, and are required for normal male sexual development. Roundup herbicide exposure was found to induce oxidative stress and to activate multiple-stress response pathways within affected cells, and was associated with an increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration leading to Ca2+ overload, and cell death. Thirty-minute incubation tests with glyphosate alone (36 ppm) also increased Ca2+ uptake, and both Roundup and glyphosate were observe to downregulate reduced glutathione levels. As glutathione is an antioxidant (electron donor) found within every cell in the human body, protecting it against oxidative stress, as well as maintaining a wide range of biochemical reactions such as DNA and protein synthesis and repair, amino acid transport, prostaglandin synthesis, amino acid and enzyme activation, a dysregulation of glutathione can result in a wide range of adverse effects. The researchers noted Glyphosate has been described as an endocrine disruptor affecting the male reproductive system; however, the molecular basis of its toxicity remains to be clarified. We could propose that Roundup toxicity, implicating in Ca2+ overload, cell signaling misregulation, stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or depleted antioxidant defenses could contribute to Sertoli cell disruption of spermatogenesis that could impact male fertility. A more recent 2013 study in male rats published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Reproductive Safety found glyphosate (in combination with another pesticide) provoked severe oxidative stress in male testes, resulting in inhibited testosterone production and disrupted gonadotropin levels.[5] Given the growing body of research clearly revealing Roundups toxicity to the germline of animal species, the argument can be made that this chemical has contraceptive properties and therefore genocidal consequences. By directly affecting the biologically immortal cells within the testes, whose DNA contains over 3 billion years worth of information essential for there being a future for our species as a whole, Roundup should be considered an instrument of mass destruction. At the very least, the precautionary principle should be applied, and any chemical that signals the potential to disrupt or destroy our species germline cells, should be banned unless the manufacturer can prove beyond a reasonable doubt its safety to exposed populations.

"Average Obamacare insurance rates really are going up by 22 percent.Last week, the Obama administration shared prices for Obamacare health insurance plans in most states. Now that markets in every state have published prices, we have a complete picture and, on average, the price increases are substantial. In 2015, the comparable rate was 4 percent; this year it was 8 percent.Our map shows the price change for the most inexpensive midlevel plan everywhere in the country, thanks to data collected by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform. We looked at that kind of plan because it tends to be the most popular among Obamacare customers. The administration study looked at a more expensive type of plan, known as the benchmark. Prices for those plans are also going up by an average of 22 percent nationwide.Premiums are rising a lot in many parts of the country, but not everywhere. Despite big increases, like a near-doubling of premiums in parts of Arizona, there are also places where premiums are going down.Percentage changes get a lot of attention, in part because they can shock the household budgets of people who have become accustomed to last yearâ€™s prices. But the data show that not all of the places with big price increases look that expensive compared with nearby communities.The numbers below show the monthly price of insurance for a 40-year-old nonsmoker next year. Kansas will have big increases, but still has reasonable premiums, compared with its neighbors. Vermont will have modest increases, but remains expensive. Arizona is the real outlier: as my colleague Abby Goodnough wrote recently, the parts of Arizona that experienced the large increases had been among the cheapest places in the country to buy insurance last year. Now, with near-doubling of premiums, itâ€™s becoming one of the most expensive.Most people who buy Obamacare plans wonâ€™t feel the full brunt of these prices â€” or price increases. More than 80 percent of Obamacare marketplace customers get a form of federal subsidy that is tied to their income. Because of the complexities of the subsidy formula, many people in these markets may even see their share of the premiums go down. But people paying the full price of premiums will feel the sting of these increases, and millions of subsidized people will need to at least switch health plans to keep their premium from going up.If you buy your own insurance, donâ€™t assume that the numbers on these maps mean your costs are going way up. You need to look at your state marketplace website and see what insurance will cost for you. If you need advice picking the best plan for your needs, we created some flow charts that may help. If you get insurance from your job or from a government program, like Medicare, these rates donâ€™t apply to you at all. Premiums for those kinds of insurance are rising at a much slower pace.A crucial question for government officials, insurers and consumers is whether the increases this year are a one-time market correction or a sign that the Obamacare markets have become unstable. There are several good reasons to think 2017 is an unusual year for these markets.But one worrisome sign for the future can be seen in our last map. Obamacare relies on competition among insurance companies to keep prices reasonable, and there are a growing number of places where there is no real competition. According to the McKinsey analysis, about 18 percent of people eligible for Obamacare plans live in places where there is only one choice of insurer.",1
"6 Ways Too Much Screen Time May Be Bad for Your KidsBy Jeffrey Green Some countries consider childhood screen addiction to be a clinical disorder and have rehab facilities in which to treat the afflicted children. Too much screen time is bad for your kids health on many different levels and must be treated like any other addiction so the damage can be stopped, and hopefully reversed. Without question the electronic screens of many devices are causing a crisis of sleep deprivation for all age groups. However, the loss of sleep is most detrimental to children. Kids need more sleep than adults due to their developing body and mind. The average child needs 10-12 hours of sleep each night in order for them to grow and develop properly, but screen time is shaving off hours of that much-needed sleep time. The average child is constantly sleep deprived and trying to learn, grow and develop on 6-8 hours of sleep per night at the most. Children who sleep with electronic devices in the their bedroom get less sleep than those who leave the devices in another room of the home at night. Not only are the children playing games and texting when they should be asleep, but the blue light emitted from the devices hinders sleep even after the device is shut off. All electronics, including cell phones, tablets, iPads and TVs, emit a blue light from the screen. The body interprets that blue light as daylight and the brain sends out the signal to wake up. Instead of being sleepy at bedtime, the child is now wide awake even when the electronic screen is shut off. A kid who is suffering from sleep deprivation will typically be cranky, have an increased risk of obesity, have a short attention span, lack decision-making skills, have increased health problems, be lethargic and do poorly in school. And all of this can be traced back to too much screen time. The use of any device with an electronic screen seems to require the need to sit down, or at least be still, while using. The sedentary nature, combined with ads for high-calorie junk food, often leads to childhood obesity. Children are naturally full of energy and have an inborn need to run, jump and otherwise be active. When that normal desire to be active is curtailed and they sit on their haunches for hours on end, they will become overweight. Obesity leads to a variety of health problems, including diabetes, joint problems and heart disease. Childhood obesity is an epidemic in most countries, too much screen time is the biggest contributing factor to the epidemic. There used to be a 20/20/20 rule for those who had to spend long hours working in front of their computer screens every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. That 20/20/20 rule was implemented to help prevent eye strain and potential vision problems in the future. Kids wont take their eyes off the electronic screen for 20 seconds, even if they have heard of the 20/20/20 rule. Immediate eye strain and pain can occur from staring at the screen too long; and its too soon to know what type of vision problems the future may hold for those kids who have too much screen time now. Phone neck, text thumb and several other new medical terms had to be coined in order to describe the various aches and pains which are developing from too much screen time. The head, neck and wrists are often held at odd angles, and thumbs are used in ways they were never meant to be used just to accommodate an electronic device. It all adds up to childhood aches and pains which will worsen as the child becomes an adult. Back pain, arthritis, repetitive motion syndrome and migraines are just some of the chronic and often debilitating health problems a kid who has too much screen time today may develop in the future. Kids who spend too much time with electronics lack in normal social skills that are needed to help them develop into a well-rounded adult. While kids know their way around keypads, they dont know how to talk one-on-one to another person. Social skills, people skills and the ability to interact with others of all ages is lacking in kids who spend too much interacting with an electronic device and have limited face time with people. By not developing the ability to interact with others face-to-face, future adult relationships for the child will be impeded. Employment, romance, friendships and simple social etiquette will be limited and awkward if a child never develops normal social skills. Ask any child what their favorite video game is and in all probability it will involve violence. Even very young kids are drawn to games that use weapons to kill. The more violent and bloody, the more popular the video game typically becomes. That translates into aggression as the child becomes a teenager. Studies show that teens who spend a lot of time watching violent TV shows and/or playing violent video games are far more likely to be aggressive both in the home and at school. These aggressive teens fight with their siblings and peers, argue with teachers and parents and just always seems to be an outburst waiting to happen.

They do this to distract you from the real issues. Its 10 oclock.do you know what your government is up to?? Cannot be confirmed or validated? Why do you think they have developed laws against texting while driving? In my final note, I want to show the irony of your statement about people not knowing what their government is doing. If you cannot stop the PHONE from leading you around by the nose, how are you going to address a more serious problem? the comment wasnt meant for you. you do not have enough information to know what point i;m trying to makebecause its meant for activistpost. AP is just another gov operation. They have been censoring my comments over and over again. Ill try posting it again in another comment below. My point to them is that they enjoy censoring those who know what is going on this maniacal world. Thats because AP is part of the matrix. Most of them are. Get a clue, and stop slobbering retorts to those you know nothing about. Im not a fellow addict in denial. Im on the same side that you are choosing, I;m just a little bit smarter than you. Explains why your representatives are the way they are. Stupid is as stupid does. Seasonal greeting from your government: Have a scary christmas and a crappy new year. This is the elephant in the room that the typical american will scoff at and minimalize because they are one of the gadget addicts themselves. Einstein said, Finding the problem is more important than the solution We are still in denial. Have you seen the text speak on comment boards? We are losing our ability to spell and type correctly. Think how easy your kids will be to control with this kind of behavior and addiction. Mmmm well the little mind control gadgets are working quite well. Those who can not see this are themselves addicted and controlled by the T V, cell phone, and other various electronic gadgets like computers and so on. People are entertaining themselves to death and they are not aware of what is happening. Unfortunately those who are trapped in this are no longer aware that they are caught in the matrix. Being unaware they will follow the pied piper right off into oblivion. Those left behind will have a brave new world which will again have to evolve from a new beginning. It is possibly a de- evolution or inevitable result of the electronic lobotomy that has happened. There are those who will see this however they are a minority and most likely spiritually advanced enough to resist the temptation. The zombie apocalypse is before us right there in front of us and few see this methinks. Blessings from the serene mind ",0
"copyright 2009, The Washington Post CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Creating an original organism required no bolt of lightning for a team of University of Virginia students. But it did take buckets of ice, vials of bacteria and a FedEx delivery. Nestled in the package were bits of DNA, whipped up in California and ordered online. When they arrived at a lab crowded with flasks, pipettes and aging equipment held together with pieces of red tape, the students plunged vials of E. coli bacteria into the ice-filled buckets. Then they heated the vials up and cooled them down again. During that process, the tiny bacterial cells cracked open just enough to let the DNA inside, and a new life form was born: an army of tiny arsenic-absorbers, offering the possibility of cheaper, easier ways to clean up contaminated water.

"Perhaps it is hard to make anyone too alarmed about the free-speech rights of lawyers -- even when the people you want to alarm are the lawyers on the Supreme Court. A small Minnesota law firm was at the court Tuesday, asking the justices to declare unconstitutional a 2005 federal law that was meant to prevent bankruptcy abuse. One of its provisions forbids lawyers from advising clients to 'incur more debt' if the clients are contemplating filing for bankruptcy. For one thing, the firm's lawyer G. Eric Brunstad Jr. told the justices, that might sometimes be a legitimate thing to do. But more important, he said, the law interferes with the First Amendment and a lawyer's responsibility to give 'unfettered, candid advice.' The law 'proscribes truthful information about entirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys who are trying to apply it, it creates an impossible situation for them, and it harms the client,' said Brunstad, who is representing protesting lawyers in the Edina, Minn., firm of Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz. To which Justice Antonin Scalia replied: So? 'That's why it's a stupid law,' Scalia said. But before Brunstad could make another point, he added: 'Now, where is the prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?' As Justice John Paul Stevens reminded, the court tries to avoid constitutional questions about Congress's actions when there are other ways to judge a statute. So the justices peppered Brunstad with questions and hypotheticals, although some seemed more devil's-advocate than hostile. Perhaps the law only reinforces rules prohibiting lawyers from giving their clients unethical advice, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. 'What in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right?' she asked Brunstad. Brunstad said Congress didn't have First Amendment concerns in mind when it passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, but lawyers Robert Milavetz and Barbara Nevin challenged the law right away. The heart of their four-year legal battle has been over the 'incur more debt' provision. They argue that there are times when those in dire financial situations should take on more debt -- to refinance a mortgage for a lower interest rate, for instance, or to buy a car necessary for work. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit agreed that the provision violates the First Amendment. But government lawyers defending the law said the restriction should be read as applying only when the lawyer and client are conspiring to abuse the bankruptcy system by running up large debts in hopes that they will never have to be fully repaid. The government says the statute's phrase 'in contemplation of bankruptcy' is a term of art that denotes 'an action taken with intent to abuse the protections of bankruptcy laws.' Assistant Solicitor General William Jay said the intent was not to prohibit lawful advice but to protect clients from 'improper, unethical, abusive or even ... criminally fraudulent advice by the attorney.' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was Jay's chief antagonist. He walked him through an extended hypothetical about a client thinking of bankruptcy while also contemplating a trip to Tahiti. A lawyer might have trouble advising whether such spending would be proper, Roberts said, without risking that something he said could be interpreted as guidance on how to abuse the system. 'A lawyer sort of has to stop and think at every turn: Well, could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is this just construed as telling clients what they can and can't do?' Roberts said. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wondered if the law would prohibit a lawyer from advising a client facing bankruptcy that she could incur more debt to pay for medical care for a life-threatening situation. Jay said the lawyer could advise the woman to incur the debt, if her intent was not to abuse the system or defraud creditors. But Brunstad disagreed. 'The lawyer would be prohibited from advising her to incur debt to get needed medical attention, and the government, in trying to articulate a way around that during the course of the argument, articulated no less than five different standards,' Brunstad said. None of them are in the statute, he added. ",1
"Fukushima: Your Days of Eating Pacific Ocean Fish Are OverJoe Martino Gary Stamper, a writer for Falling into Consciousness, has put together a great resource of information that tracks what has been developing over time in Fukushima as it relates to the nuclear incident. Here is an excerpt from his research, be sure to check out the link below to get access to all of his tireless research. The heart-breaking news from Fukushima continues to get worse -a lot worse. It is, quite simply, an out-of-control flow of death and destruction. TEPCO is finally admitting that radiation has been leaking to the Pacific Ocean all along and its not showing signs of stopping just yet. It now appears that anywhere from 300 to possibly over 450 tons of contaminated water that contains radioactive iodine, cesium, and strontium-89 and 90, is flooding into the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima Daiichi site everyday. To give you an idea of how bad that actually is, Japanese experts estimate Fukushimas fallout at 20-30 times as high as as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings in 1945. Theres a lot youre not being told. Oh, the information is out there, but you have to dig pretty deep to find it, and you wont find it on the corporate-owned evening news.

"The Plundering of South SudanTony Cartalucci The SPLM has received support from the US and Israel throughout the duration of the civil war fought between southern rebels and Khartoum, which has historically had unfriendly relations with the West and has moved very closely to China in recent times to jointly develop the countrys oil wealth prior to the separation. Romantic notions for self-determination did not motivate the West to support southern secession; the objective was to partition Sudan and deprive Khartoum of economically relevant territory in the south where most of the oil fields lie. In exchange for the financial, material, political, and diplomatic support received from the West, the new government in Juba endorsed a Faustian pact with its sponsors to open its economy to international finance capital and multinational interests. The government in Juba even applied for IMF membership before it had even officially gained independence from Sudan. The piece would continue by laying out the current dilemma for the West: Despite supporting the Souths independence with diplomatic muscle and military aid, the United States has been unable to gain a foothold in the countrys oil sector; Jubas crippled economy remains dominated by Asian companies, primarily from China. South Sudan must rely on pipelines that run through Khartoum to export its oil, and the two countries produced around 115,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012, less than half the volume produced in the years before South Sudans independence. Both sides have nearly gone to war over disputed oil fields that straddle a poorly demarcated border. Judging from the poor economic performance of both countries since the partition and the dramatic loss of the life in the ongoing crisis, the experiment of South Sudanese independence is failing. Image: Violence predictably is centered around currently Chinese-controlled oil infrastructure. The goal is to have violence drive the Chinese out just as was done by NATO in Libya. The piece would go on to note that peace deals reached leaving Sudan intact could have avoided the deadly conflict now raging and that of course is correct. However, peace is not and never was the goal of the West and its involvement in Africa economic gain is. Precisely because China still maintains extensive holdings in Sudan and South Sudans oil infrastructure, the conflict will be brought to a fever pitch and unsurprisingly the conflicts epicenter corresponds with South Sudans primary oil producing regions. If and when the Chinese are pushed out of South Sudan, the West will continue either across the border to establish routes for exporting their newly gained oil wealth from the landlocked country, or proceed through Kenya with or without the current government in Nairobis backing. The BBC would report in their article, Chinas oil fears over South Sudan fighting, that (emphasis added): The stakes could not be higher for China, the largest investor in South Sudans oil sector, as fierce fighting continues between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and those of his former deputy. Some of the largest oil fields China operates are in areas controlled by fighters backing Riek Machar, the countrys vice-president until he was sacked in July. Oil production has already dropped by 20% since the onset of the conflict three weeks ago and more than 300 Chinese workers have been evacuated. The spectre of their Libyan experience also weighs heavily on the Chinese minds project after project now lies deserted because of heavy fighting during the Arab Spring uprising of 2011, inflicting huge losses on China. Most telling of all is the BBCs reference to Libya another nation destroyed by Western military aggression that saw both Russian and Chinese interests crumble overnight and replaced by Western corporations. While South Sudans chaos is being orchestrated more covertly by the West, the final goal of pushing out the Chinese and taking over is the same. Similar covert destabilization can be seen all across what the 2006 Strategic Studies Institutes report String of Pearls: Meeting the Challenge of Chinas Rising Power across the Asian Littoral calls Chinas String of Perals. This includes US-backed militants attempting to carve off the province of Baluchistan from Pakistanwhere China has established a port at Gwadar and at another Chinese port in the state of Rakhine, Myanmar that has been the scene of brutal, genocidal violence carried out by democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyis saffron monks against Rohingya refugees. Setting Up Shop in South Sudan There is no doubt that the US and its accomplices Israel and Uganda have decided to stay in South Sudan. TheUS corporate foundation-funded Enough Project provided the rhetorical justification for an enduring presence in the war-torn African state in its Al Jazeera op-ed titled, Al Jazeera America Op-ed: South Sudans Salva Kiir needs to put his black hat back on, which stated: To be sure, growing pains are common in societies working to secure their independence after years of marginalization and authoritarian rule. Building a cohesive national identity among South Sudans 81 ethnic groups will take generations. Still, the looming specters of mass intercommunal violence means we cannot afford to be complacent. The United States committed itself to the South Sudanese peoples long march toward independence decades ago. It would be a shame if America allowed a return to war when the South Sudanese are so close to securing their future. With that humanitarian/freedom-promoting foot-in-the-door, the West has the pretext it needs to meddle for decades to come. To begin with, Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI) signed what it called a water infrastructure and technology development deal with South Sudans government in 2012. The deal allegedly covers desalination, irrigation, water transport and purification, but a visit to Israel Military Industries Ltd. website indicates they are military contractors and arms manufacturers, not engineers and certainly not specialists in water infrastructure. Other sources claim IMI will serve as a conduit for actual Israeli water firms but in light of US, Israeli, Saudi, and Qatari joint operations elsewhere, IMI will most likely serve as a conduit for weapons, cash, and conflict as well (or instead). In 2013, Israel and South Sudan would begin forging oil deals. In UPIs report, South Sudan signs oil deal with Israel, it was stated: South Sudan says it has signed an agreement with several Israeli oil companies, a potentially significant strategic move that will consolidate the Jewish states relations with the fledgling, oil-rich East African state. UPI would continue, highlighting the glaring problem of actually exporting the oil to turn a profit: South Sudans petroleum and mining minister, Dhieu Dau, announced the oil deal last week after he returned from a visit to Israel. He said negotiations were ongoing with Israeli companies, which he did not identify, seeking to invest in South Sudan. Dau indicated the southern government in Juba, ramshackle capital of the infant state, hoped to export oil to Israel, but observed that this could not happen before March. He gave no indication how the landlocked south would achieve this, or what volume of crude would be involved. But its a move Khartoum would do everything possible to wreck. Finally, the UPI report indicates the much larger implications of Israels (and the US) involvement in South Sudan, using it as a springboard to topple neighboring Sudan in the north: The prospect of Israel actually getting oil from South Sudan remains uncertain, given Jubas difficulties with Khartoum. There has been talk of building a 1,000-mile export pipeline from South Sudan across Kenya to the Indian Ocean that would free Juba from reliance on Khartoums pipelines. But no definite plans for the project, expected to cost around $2 billion, have yet materialized. It may be that Israeli companies are seeking to help out in that regard if only to undermine the Islamic-oriented Khartoum regime and its alliance with Tehran, and to gain access to the Nile River, Egypts primary source of water and a strategic target. During Sudans civil war, one of Africas longest conflicts in which some 2 million people died, Israel provided the southern rebels with arms, training and funding, as it has done in other parts of Africa seeking to weaken its Arab adversaries. Clearly, the presence of Israeli arms dealers is not to develop South Sudans infrastructure but rather to flood the region with weapons to flush out the Chinese and eventually stab northward toward Sudan and its capital of Khartoum. UPIs report would go on to admit that military aid was still undoubtedly flowing to South Sudan for this very purpose. In addition to a proxy military confrontation with Sudan, the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have been attempting to overthrow the government in Khartoum from within attempting an Arab Spring-style uprising in late 2013 that eventually fizzled. Enter US AFRICOM and Ugandas Museveni Infamous Western collaborator and Ugandan dictator-for-life Yoweri Museveni has been fighting the Wests proxy wars in Africa for decades. He has also done much within his borders to appease the West including selling large tracts of land to foreign developers right out from beneath the feet of his own people many times killing landowners who refused eviction. In 2011 under the false pretext of fighting Joseph Konys Lords Resistance Army the US would begindeploying troops to Uganda. By 2013, these troops would still be there when violence began to spread across nearby South Sudan, US troops conveniently still stationed in Uganda would be mobilized for the evacuation of US citizens. Stars and Stripes would report in their article, Marines airlift US Embassy personnel out of South Sudan, that: Nonessential U.S. Embassy personnel were evacuated Friday from South Sudan aboard two KC-130 aircraft assigned to a Marine crisis response team positioned in nearby Uganda. The article would also report: Last week, the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force-Crisis Response also was pre-positioned at Entebbe, Uganda, to provide additional support. The unit, from Moron, Spain, was formed less than a year ago to bolster AFRICOMs crisis-response capabilities. Uganda, like Sudan, has clearly been permanently brought into AFRICOMs fold under an initial false humanitarian pretext that was then quietly shifted to the permanent occupation of African territory. And Uganda not only serves as a base for US AFRICOM, but is also using its soldiers to carry out AFRICOMs objectives beyond Ugandas borders. The Guardian would report in its recent article, South Sudan peace talks falter as Uganda sends in troops, that: The South Sudan peace talks being held in Ethiopia have stalled, officials say, as a rebel commander claims big victories against the South Sudanese government and Uganda sends in more troops and military hardware. The report would also claim: Uganda, he said, had sent 1,200 troops to secure installations such as the airport and state house, adding that Ugandan military aircraft had bombed several rebel-held positions. Uganda says its deployment of more troops and military hardware to Juba this week came at the request of Kiir. Lieutenant Colonel Paddy Ankunda, a Ugandan military spokesman, said on Wednesday that reinforcements were dispatched on Monday and Tuesday to plug security gaps. He denied the Ugandans were actively involved in combat. Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, is a strong ally of Kiir. The neighbouring countries have built a bond that goes back to South Sudans armed struggle for independence from Sudan and the Khartoum government. Museveni recently warned Machar that East African countries would unite to defeat him militarily if he does not agree to attend peace talks. In essence, Uganda is providing the manpower on the ground while the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others provide the cash, weapons, and everything else. It is another proxy war, just like the ongoing conflict in Syria, albeit with Ugandan troops literally invading South Sudan to prop up the Wests proxy government in Juba. Who is funding and arming rebel groups fighting the Wests proxy government is still unclear. Reports indicate it may be dissident factions of South Sudans own armed forces involved in a recent coup attempt. Other theories suggest that US, Uganda, and/or Israel may be funding and arming both sides hoping to carry the conflict onward to Khartoum. It is clear that Khartoum, Sudan, one way or another, is the US-Israeli-Saudi-Qatari goal to complete the theft of Sudanese oil as well as the means to export it out of the broken, worn-torn, decimated country. This is the current state of the Wall Street-London global order in Africa and a tattered, exploited Africa in our future should this state persist.

"Grandma Wounded By Four Bullets - Shoots Back With .45selfnews Post Paris Ainsworth was shot multiple times last Saturday night and bears four bullet wounds during a random driveway shooting in Detroit. Sensing something was wrong before the two assailants took aim, she fortunately placed her .45 in her pocket before exiting her car just in case. She and her family know this move saved her life, especially when she refused to die but rather fired back eight rounds, injuring them. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player Note the way she describes the attackers. This writer is taking notes from her experience. Her training and empowerment successfully precluded her fear. She obtained her conceal-carry permit two years ago following a mugging injury she received ten years ago. Bob Owens ofBearingarms.com had this to say about how Ainsworth handled the situation: Experts will tell you that a large part of surviving a gunfight is mental. After being shot three times in the body and once in the hand, many people would have registered, Im shot, and they would have wilted to the ground what experts call a psychological stop. If youve ever studied film of gunfights, youll note that many gun battles stop just this way, with someone taking hits and quitting the fight, even though they have not suffered a hit to the central nervous (CNS) system, might have suffered superficial wounds, or might not have been hit at all. [] Youll note that she has quality weapons, good ammo, trains regularly, good situational awareness, and has whats been called the fighting mindset. If I were a Detroit area self-defense company owner, I might consider attempting to hire Ainsworth as a speaker, if not as an instructor. She did everything that a shooter should do in gunfight, and because she did, she prevailed. Yes never give up! And what he says is a good reason to avoid television and movies especially action types that are full of propaganda, inaccurate tactics and are downright self-defeating. Imagine the tragedy of going down because of misguided belief and even terror from years of this type of imagery. He notes that the police often keep the self-defense weapon until an investigation is complete. This is all the more reason to have more than one firearm.Which she does, and Owens identified her other handgun as a Sig SP2022 that will protect her until her .45 is returned.

"The decision by Britainâ€™s top taxman to send his heavy mob in to investigate the courier company Hermes speaks volumes about working life in modern Britain. Make no mistake, the probe by HMRC compliance officers into allegations that courier drivers are being wrongly classified as self-employed and paid less than the legally binding national minimum wage goes well beyond the business practices of a single company. Indeed, the news that the Treasury is taking a look at how people are employed across the whole â€œgig economyâ€ speaks volumes. This is about more than Hermes â€“ it is about the way in which the UK economy has been transformed during the past four decades. The Britain of the immediate postwar period differed from the Britain of 2016 in a number of ways. The manufacturing sector was bigger, employing more than 8 million people at the peak in in the mid 1960s. Successive waves of de-industrialisation â€“ in the early 80s, 90s and 2000s â€“ have hollowed out Britainâ€™s manufacturing base, which now accounts for about 10% of national output, a smaller proportion than in other leading industrial countries. The declining share of manufacturing has been accompanied by another trend: the decline in trade union membership, particularly in the private sector. Unions remain strong in those parts of manufacturing that have survived the regular downturns, at companies such as Rolls-Royce and BAe Systems for example, and in the public sector, but they have struggled to get a foothold in the new companies that have been created.  self employed earnings  The tendency, therefore, has been for high-paid, unionised jobs to be replaced by insecure, poorly paid ones where employees live in permanent fear of having contracts terminated if they make a fuss. The classic example of the changing face of Britain is the Sports Direct HQ at Shirebrook: a giant warehouse built on the site of a former pit. These trends have been accelerated by the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-09, which brought to an end a long period of uninterrupted growth and falling unemployment. The most severe slump in Britainâ€™s postwar history meant workers taking paycuts in order to keep their jobs. Austerity meant redundancy for unionised employees in the public sector. Self-employment became far more common, but it was not exactly the sort of buccaneering, entrepreneurial self-employment lionised by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Instead, many of those who were working for themselves did so reluctantly after losing full-time employment. As the Resolution Foundation reported earlier this week, the self-employed are earning less than they did 15 years ago once inflation is taken into account. Whatâ€™s more, the taxi drivers, motorcycle couriers and distribution centre workers employed in the gig economy have found that they have no entitlement to paid holidays or sick pay even when they are working full-time for a single employer. This arrangement has worked well for the companies because it means a lower pay bill and higher profits. It is not so good for the people described by Theresa May as just about managing. The drawbacks of this model are now becoming glaringly apparent. With cheap, cowed labour readily available, there has been little incentive for companies to invest in new plant, new technology or training. They have relied on the sweatshop approach instead.   Related: Self-employment used to be the dream. Now itâ€™s a nightmare | Peter Fleming   The steady decline of manufacturing has been accompanied by a worsening of Britainâ€™s balance of payments, with the 6% deficit a record for peacetime. For years, these problems have been bubbling away beneath the surface of the economy without any real attention being paid to them. There has been no wave of strikes in protest at conditions in call centres to mirror those in the coalfields or the car industry in the 1970s and early 1980s. Instead the unhappiness at what amounts to old-fashioned exploitation has manifested itself in other ways, most obviously through the vote for Brexit on 23 June. This was the chance to protest at low pay and rotten employers and millions of people took that opportunity readily.  So if you want to know why HMRC will be crawling all over Hermes, the reasonâ€™s simple: people are mightily unhappy and, somewhat belatedly, the government has got the message.",1
"Two and a half years ago I quit a job I loved. I was a widely recognised national expert in ageing services, running a consulting practice inside a growing firm. I had innovative clients, a bright and committed team, and a portfolio of services and products that I had designed to help organisations improve how they deliver care to frail older adults.  And then one day a friendâ€™s mom had a terrible accident that left her with severe and permanent brain injury. As I looked on, my friend and her family began to navigate a system I barely recognized. I had spent a quarter of a century studying the economic incentives of this sector but I realized I knew almost nothing.  I was able to help her with some things. I could explain some of the mechanics of payment (government payments for services), the roles of various healthcare organizations in the US, and the likelihood of her momâ€™s care being managed at home.  And she taught me a lot too. I learned that family relationships fray under pressure, and that it takes enormous family time and energy to manage and provide care. That even when you have ample adult children, and plenty of financial resources, you still fight against the institutional bias in our care delivery system (which prefers nursing homes and hospitals to home-based care). But, most of all, I learned that there are virtually no sources of information that are easy to use, helpful and encouraging.    Anne Tumlinson, founder of Daughterhood. Photograph: Shane Yeager   So I decided to create one. I wanted to develop an online resource that would present my technical knowledge in an accessible way and provide a space for a community to support others going through the same challenges that my friend and her family encountered.  With the help of Joseph Liu, a career change consultant, I started experimenting with creating content through blogs and videos. I made a lot of mistakes, but Liu stressed that now was the time for trial and error. Just because I was finding the work hard didnâ€™t mean I was failing. After about nine months of working through the concept, Daughterhood was born.  I wrote about the US Medicare programme, how to pay for long-term care, why you should avoid the hospital and what to do if you canâ€™t. What really surprised me was the response I received when I wrote about the underlying emotional and psychological challenges of caregiving. Not just isolation from friends and sibling rivalry but feeling like youâ€™re failing your parents. Itâ€™s something that many women, in particular, experience when they encounter a failing health and ageing care system. Itâ€™s not that men arenâ€™t caring for their parents, itâ€™s just that women need resources specifically to counteract their feelings of self-reproach.  I wrote about the importance of setting boundaries around what you can and canâ€™t do, recognising the new normal and learning to get comfortable asking for help.  This raw feeling of failure, of not being good enough â€“ this is what women experience around caregiving and itâ€™s what has created a relationship between the readers and me. Our number of website visitors, subscribers and social media following all grew and we started to see interest from around the world.  And I wanted to do more. So many women told me they needed information about how to solve problems and find support in their local area. My blogs and videos werenâ€™t going to explain which home care agency to use in St Louis, for example, or who to call when you need a friend who understands. How could I provide that service?   Related: Five things coaching can do for your small business   A year after launching the website and the blog, I started Daughterhood Circles. We connect neighbors and friends to those who need support. I brought in a part-time community manager to help mobilise women in local communities. We created toolkits. We advertised for leaders on Facebook and we have been working diligently for nine months to support groups that range in size from three members to 20. Itâ€™s a work in progress but one that makes me so proud.  The readership and community behind Daughterhood continues to grow and is starting to attract attention from further afield. From the start, Iâ€™ve been supporting myself financially through solo consulting projects, but Iâ€™m now hearing from organisations that want to sponsor content or partner with us to create more and better resources. Itâ€™s thrilling.  There is of course, nothing like creating something from scratch, taking a chance on it and seeing it take on life in the outside world. But, itâ€™s impossible to experience this if you donâ€™t take what can initially seem like huge risks. As I tell the community of Daughterhood readers who seem overwhelmed by the challenges they face, it doesnâ€™t take an enormous amount of confidence and faith to overcome this fear of failure. You just need a little â€“ just enough to keep going.

"The Chart That Proves Mainstream Media Is Lying To You About UnemploymentMichael Snyder At this point, the unemployment rate has become so meaningless that it really isnt even worth paying much attention to. If you really want to know what the employment picture looks like in the United States, you need to look at the employment-population ratio. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development defines the employment rateas the employment-to-population ratio. The employment-population ratio is many American economists favorite gauge of the American jobs picture. According to Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist for Capital Economics, The employment population ratio is the best measure of labor market conditions. This is a statistical ratiothat measures the proportion of the countrys working-age population (ages 15 to 64 in most OECD countries) that is employed. This includes people that have stopped looking for work. A chart of the employment-population ratio in the United States over the past several years is posted below Yes, we should be thankful that things have stabilized, but as you can see there has been no recovery. The percentage of Americans with a job is essentially exactly where it was three years ago. Despite the trillions of dollars that the U.S. government has borrowed, and despite the reckless money printing that the Federal Reserve has been doing, the employment situation in the U.S. has not turned around. Data for the employment-population ratio from the beginning of 2008is posted below 2008-01-01 62.9 So is there anyone out there that still wants to insist that the employment picture in the United States is getting significantly better? Anyone that wants to claim that unemployment is going down should at least wait until the unemployment-population ratio gets back up to 59 percent. Otherwise they just look foolish. Yes, the Dow is at an all-time high right now. But a bubble is always the biggest right before it bursts. Most Americans understand that the Dow has been pumped up with all of the funny money that the Fed has been printing. Most Americans understand that the stock market really does not accurately reflect the health of the U.S. economy as a whole. Just consider these numbers -The number of homeless people sleeping in homeless shelters in New York City has increased by 19 percent over the past year. -According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 146 million Americans are either poor or low income at this point. -Median household income in the United States has fallen for four consecutive years. No, the truth is that everything is most definitely not fine. If everything is fine, then why did the Federal Reserve inject another 100 billion dollars into foreign banks during the last full week of February? The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve are desperately trying to prop up the entire global economy. Unfortunately, the global financial system has been built on a foundation of sand and the tide is coming in. Back in 2008, a derivatives crisis was one of the primary causes of the worst financial panic since the Great Depression. So did we learn our lesson? No, the boys on Wall Street are back at it again as a recent article by Jim Armitage described Historically, stock markets, being driven by humans, have tended to have a similar length memory of catastrophes, before making the same dumb mistakes again. But it hasnt even been five years since derivatives (on that occasion based on daft mortgages) blew up the world, and yet these exotic creatures have already returned. With a vengeance. Research from Thomson Reuters declared that banks were creating more derivatives known as asset-backed securities than at any time since before the Lehman Brothers crash. Of those, 22 percent were made up of and forgive me the alphabet soup here CDOs and CLOs. The very type of derivatives that exploded last time. At this stage last year, only 6 percent fell into those categories. In other words, banks are creating more of the riskiest types of the riskiest products. When that happens, financial markets all over the globe will crash, economic activity will grind to a standstill and unemployment will go skyrocketing once again. But, as you saw above, we have never even come close to recovering from the last crisis. So you can believe the mind-numbing propaganda that the mainstream media is trying to feed you if you want. Unfortunately, the reality of the matter is that we have not recovered from the last major economic crisis, and another one is rapidly approaching. I hope that you are getting ready.

"Working in fast-food is no picnic. The industry is infamous for grindingly low pay and labor law violations. Yet Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the company that operates Carlâ€™s Jr. and Hardeeâ€™s, has been chosen by President-elect Donald Trump as labor secretary.Here is the record at those restaurants. When the Obama Labor Department looked at thousands of complaints involving fast-food workers, it found labor law violations in 60 percent of the investigations at Carlâ€™s Jr. and Hardeeâ€™s, usually for failure to pay the minimum wage or time and a half for overtime.The central problem for workers today is persistently low pay, even at profitable companies with highly paid executives. Mr. Puzder, however, has been adamantly opposed to a meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour. Mr. Trump has said he could stomach an increase to $10, which is still abysmal. Ideally, a labor secretary, who is supposed to have a deeper understanding of this issue, would push for much more. But Mr. Puzder has said that a big raise would mean fewer jobs for workers starting out. Even if that was true, and the evidence suggests otherwise, there are millions more who would benefit from raising the minimum wage.Mr. Puzder has also been a scathing critic of efforts by the Obama administration to update the rules for overtime-pay eligibility, which have not been fully adjusted for inflation since the mid-1970s. His argument boils down to an assertion that employees prefer a low salary and the â€œprestigeâ€ of a managerial title â€” even though they would be entitled to overtime if they remained hourly employees. His opposition to the new overtime rules is especially troubling given that it would be his task as labor secretary to defend the rules, which have been challenged in court.Mr. Puzder has also blamed the Affordable Care Act for causing a â€œrestaurant recession.â€ There is no evidence that health care reform has harmed job growth, and there is certainly no evidence of a restaurant recession.Mandatory sick leave has been criticized by Mr. Puzder as well. He says it would be an undue burden on businesses. Yet in all other advanced economies, paid sick days, paid parental leave and similar policies are rightly seen as investments in human capital, as necessary as investments in plants and equipment.For Mr. Puzder, being pro-business seems to mean being anti-worker. That makes him the wrong choice for labor secretary.",1
"Unbeaten on the racetrack last year, Rachel Alexandra won again Monday night, defeating her rival Zenyatta to take horse racing's top prize, the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Rachel Alexandra received 130 votes to 99 for Zenyatta. Two voters abstained, and one ballot was voided. Perhaps no other Horse of the Year announcement has been as anticipated, and never had the outcome been as much in doubt. There was little to separate the two horses, both females and both victors over males last year. Neither lost a race in 2009, and both recorded historic feats. With the two having never raced against one another, it was left to voters to decide who was better, or at least more deserving of the sport's highest honor. Members of the National Turf Writers Association, employees of The Daily Racing Form and racing secretaries representing tracks that are members of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association make up the electorate. The voters might have ultimately leaned toward Rachel Alexandra because she had the longer campaign, winning more races (eight, to five for Zenyatta) and defeating males three times, as opposed to once for Zenyatta. Rachel Alexandra beat top colts in the Preakness and the Haskell and defeated older horses in the Woodward. She was the first filly since 1924 to win the Preakness, the middle leg of the Triple Crown, and the only filly to win the Woodward. Zenyatta did everything she could to wrest the title from Rachel Alexandra, who once appeared to have an insurmountable lead in the Horse of the Year race. After winning her first four starts of the year, all in California and in races restricted to fillies and mares, Zenyatta ended her season with a thrilling victory over males in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita. It was the first win for a female horse in that race. Rachel Alexandra did not compete in the Breeders' Cup because her owner, Jess Jackson, does not like synthetic racing surfaces. The main track at Santa Anita has an artificial surface known as Pro-Ride. Jackson's critics and many Zenyatta supporters contended that Zenyatta deserved Horse of the Year because she showed up on one of the sport's biggest days and won a race considered pivotal for deciding year-end championships. The Horse of the Year announcement came a day after it was reported that Zenyatta was coming out of retirement to race this year as a 6-year-old. That has led to speculation that Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta would finally meet. The trainer John Shirreffs told The Daily Racing Form that Zenyatta might make her 2010 debut March 13 in the Santa Margarita at Santa Anita and could race after that April 3 in the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn. Because the Apple Blossom will be run on a dirt track and Rachel Alexandra is 2 for 2 at Oaklawn, the race could also be on her schedule. She is preparing at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans for her 4-year-old debut. Jackson has yet to decide where she will make her 2010 debut. Rachel Alexandra was a unanimous selection as the champion 3-year-old. Zenyatta received all but one of the votes cast for older filly or mare champion. Among the other honorees were Lookin At Lucky (2-year-old male), She Be Wild (2-year-old filly), Summer Bird (3-year-old male), Gio Ponti (turf male and older male), Informed Decision (female sprinter), Kodiak Kowboy (male sprinter), Goldikova (female turf horse) and Mixed Up (steeplechase horse). Godolphin Racing was chosen as the leading owner, Juddmonte Farms as the outstanding breeder, Julien Leparoux as the top jockey, Christian Santiago Reyes as the best apprentice jockey and Steve Asmussen as the outstanding trainer.

"Wayne Bridge got his revenge on John Terry as Manchester City dented nine-man Chelsea's title challenge with a stunning 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. After snubbing Terry's offer of a handshake during the pre-match greeting between the teams, Bridge - who this week quit England duty as a result of Terry's alleged affair with his ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel - played his part as City handed Chelsea their first home defeat in 38 games since Arsenal won at the Bridge in November 2008. Frank Lampard put the Premier League leaders ahead in the 42nd minute but Carlos Tevez equalised in first half stoppage-time following mistakes from Terry and goalkeeper Hilario. Craig Bellamy struck for the visitors in the 51st minute with a shot from a tight angle that Hilario should have saved. Tevez scored his second from the penalty spot after Juliano Belletti was sent off for fouling Gareth Barry in the 76th minute, then Michael Ballack was dismissed in the closing stages. Bellamy rubbed salt into Chelsea's wounds with the fourth in the 87th minute before Lampard's 90th minute penalty reduced the deficit. Chelsea remain just one point ahead of Manchester United, while City go above Tottenham into fourth place. ",1
"Fed Programs Preschool, Says No Lunch From Home Without Doctors NoteDaisy Luther A Richmond, Virginia mother received the following note, telling her not to pack a lunch for her pre-school age child. (source: Momdot.com) Dear Parents, I have received word from Federal Programs Preschool pertaining to lunches from home. Parents are to be informed that students can only bring lunches from home if there is a medical condition requiring a specific diet, along with a physicians note to that regard. I am sorry for any inconvenience. If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Stephanie [redacted] the Health Coordinator for Federal Programs Preschool at [redacted]. Thanks, As a family, we have made the decision to avoid a host of ingredients that are all found in abundance in school lunches. We dont consume: But this week at my daughters school, the offerings are: There is not one thing on that list that falls into our normal diet. Add a side of rBGH-filled milk and a corn-syrup laden fruit cup and you have a complete nutritional disaster. Why should the parents be required to bear the expense of a doctors visit to get the required note to be allowed to send healthful, homemade lunches for their children? Im glad you asked. Its all about profit and control. Because, you see, the federal government must have all the little children on board in order to subsidize the farmers, make the rich richer, and make the poor sicker. Throw in some Obamacare to treat the resulting nutritionally-driven illnesses and it is a win-win situation at least it is if you own a food processing plant, a medical facility, or a factory farm and youre not the ones eating that so-called food. Agricultural surplus is used to provide a base of food which is provided to the schools free of charge. It is then turned into processed junk for the public school system while the food manufacturers profit. The National School Lunch Program, enacted in 1946, has a mission besides just feeding hungry children: to subsidize the agricultural business by using up beef, cheese, and pork. The school lunches are loaded with these artery-clogging ingredients, in the most processed forms possible. According to an article in the NY Times, heres how it happens: The Agriculture Department pays about $1 billion a year for commodities like fresh apples and sweet potatoes, chickens and turkeys. Schools get the food free; some cook it on site, but more and more pay processors to turn these healthy ingredients into fried chicken nuggets, fruit pastries, pizza and the like. Some $445 million worth of commodities are sent for processing each year, a nearly 50 percent increase since 2006. The Agriculture Department doesnt track spending to process the food, but school authorities do. The Michigan Department of Education, for example, gets free raw chicken worth $11.40 a case and sends it for processing into nuggets at $33.45 a case. The schools in San Bernardino, Calif., spend $14.75 to make French fries out of $5.95 worth of potatoes. The money is ill spent. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has warned that sending food to be processed often means lower nutritional value and noted that many schools continue to exceed the standards for fat, saturated fat and sodium. A 2008 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that by the time many healthier commodities reach students, they have about the same nutritional value as junk foods. Why is this allowed to happen? Part of it is that school authorities dont want the trouble of overseeing real kitchens. Part of it is that the management companies are saving money by not having to pay skilled kitchen workers. In addition, the management companies have a cozy relationship with food processers, which routinely pay the companies rebates (typically around 14 percent) in return for contracts. The rebates have generally been kept secret from schools, which are charged the full price. So, lots of people are making money while feeding children nutritionally bereft garbage. People who dont know how to cook are warming up processed junk to feed to kids who cannot afford anything better. That free lunch isnt so free when you consider the high percentage of kids suffering from obesity and chronic illnesses due to their poor nutritional intake. Public schools serve more than 4 billion meals every year a number that would make many fast-food chains envious and officials say all those lunches are contributing to the growing health crisis among kids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in adolescents since 1980, spurring an epidemic of type II diabetes, once considered an adult-onset condition. Obesity has also been associated with heart disease, arthritis, and certain cancers, and researchers have found fatty streaks in the blood vessels of children as young as 10. USDA needs to relate the current crisis in kids health to the meals that are being served, especially to poor kids, because thats the population thats most vulnerable, says Antonia Demas, director of the Food Studies Institute, a child-nutrition group based in upstate New York. Because low-income children often eat both breakfast and lunch at school, they get at least two-thirds of their calories from school each day, and theyre the population really showing an increase in the diet-related diseases. (source) As with anything the federal government touches, school lunches are cloaked in do-gooder benevolence, but they are a poisoned gift that benefits those who already have money at the expense of our societys most vulnerable people: poor children. As our economy continues to decline, more kids will be forced to take these free lunches if they expect to have anything to eat all day. So, now, at least one school wants children to have a doctors note to say no to the school lunch offerings of hormones, GMOs, preservatives, and grease. They must have the permission of a professional to avoid junk food. A parents good judgement is not sufficient, it seems, to make the healthy decision to provide a toxin-free lunch. Does anyone else see the irony here? Kids are a target. The school system is trying to change the rules to force us to feed our children these food-like substances and to disallow us the right to nourish them as we see fit. By controlling the food that our kids eat, they are controlling their entire lives, right down to their ability to think critically, their future fertility, and their overall lifespans. We are lathering our skin with petrochemicals. BPA is leaching into our food and beverages. Chemtrails and questionable farming methods are tainting the air that we breatheits enough for a book, not merely an article. Additives like MSG and unpronounceable non-food ingredients are killing off our brain cells and triggering the growth of cancerous cells in our bodies. And the result of all of this? If it was only one toxic assault, or maybe even two or three, you might be able to write this off as accidental, something that just happened due to carelessness. But with all of the evidence proving irrefutably that the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe is making us sick, how can we form any other conclusion than the one that states, This is a deliberate attack. All of the alphabet agencies that are supposedly there for our protection are merely arms of the giant propaganda machine. They are there to convince us that someone would put a stop to it if these things were actually bad for us. They are there to dispense a false sense of confidence in our governing bodies and to make us feel as though our health and safety is their first concern. Moderation is not an option. We have to fight back through strict avoidance. Think about this. Would you willingly feed your child just a little bit of cyanide? Would you let them have a serving of strychnine once in a while? Would you purposely give them a cigarette just because you happened to be out and that is what was offered? Would you let them drink bleach from the laundry room as long as it wasnt in an amount that would be immediately deadly and if it was diluted so that it didnt burn their throats when they swallowed it? Our politicians, government officials, and protection agencies are bought and paid for. They are at best, complicit, and at worst, the ones instituting this. (source) A sick, fat, malnourished populace isnt too likely to gear up for a resistance against the powers that be when it feels like effort just to go from the couch to the refrigerator.

"They Are Systematically Destroying Our Independence And Making Us All Serfs Of The StateMichael Snyder Unfortunately, as you will see below, the percentage of Americans that are self-employed is at an all-time record low and the percentage of Americans with a full-time job has declined to a level not seen in about 30 years. As a result, more Americans than ever find themselves forced to turn to the government for assistance. When you add it all up, about half of all Americans get money from the government each month these days. And yes, there will always be poor people that cannot take care of themselves who need help, but when you have more than half of the population dependent on the government that is a major problem. You see, the truth is that our independence is systematically being taken away from us and we are steadily being made serfs of the state. And once you become a serf of the state, it is very hard to resist anything the government is doing in a meaningful way. After all, the money that you are getting from the government is enabling you to survive. In essence, your allegiance has been at least partially purchased and you may not even realize it. Of course this is not how the United States was supposed to operate. We were never intended to be a collectivist nation. Rather, we were intended to be a country where liberty and freedom thrived and where most people would be able to independently take care of themselves. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult to be economically independent in America today. One reason for this is that the environment for small businesses in this country is the most toxic that it has ever been before. The federal government, our state governments and even our local governments are constantly coming up with new ways to oppress small business. Yes, you read that correctly. Despite all of the trouble that the IRS is currently in, they are still choosing to specifically go after small businesses with both barrels. As a recent Forbes article explained, the IRS plans to send threatening letters to 20,000 small businesses all over the country The tax agency is doing some targeting of its own, fingering at least 20,000 small businesses. And that number will grow. The scrutiny on this group and in this way is a little frightening. Small business people across America are receiving IRS notices. More will be coming.The IRS gathers data from many third partiesincluding credit card companiesto see if you picked up every nickel of income. This is absolutely disgusting, but it is just another example of how small business is being eradicated in the United States. As I mentioned in a previous article, the percentage of Americans that are self-employed has dropped to a record low Sadly, that is becoming increasingly difficult to do as well. The chart below was created byChartist Friend from Pittsburgh, and it shows that the percentage of working age Americans with a full-time job dropped sharply to 47 percent during the last recession and it has stayed about that level ever since. The yellow line is the line in the chart which demonstrates this The quality of jobs in this country has been steadily falling for quite some time, and we are rapidly transitioning to an economy where part-time employment will be much more prominent. But you cant support a family or be economically independent on a part-time income. In fact, most of those that try to make it on a part-time income find that they must turn to the government for help. And right now, a higher percentage of Americans are economically dependent on the government than ever before. The following is from a recent article by Charles Hugh-Smith Why? Because half of us are getting a direct check, benefit or payment from the state. Over 61 million people get a check from Social Security, over 50 million draw Medicare benefits, another 50 million get Medicaid benefits, 47 million receive SNAP food stamp benefits, 22 million people work directly for the state on all levels, millions more work for government contractors that are effectively proxies of the state, millions more receive Federally funded extended unemployment, retirement checks, Section 8 housing benefits, and so on. Orwell underestimated the power of complicity. Once a citizen receives a direct payment from the state, the state has purchased their complicity, for no matter how much that citizen may complain privately about the state, he or she will never risk the payment/benefit by resisting the state in a politically meaningful way. Once you get a check from the state, you begin loving your servitude. The collusion of the state and its central bank is truly a thing of authoritarian beauty: the central bank (the Federal Reserve) creates money out of thin air and buys government bonds with the new money. The state can thus borrow unlimited sums at low rates of interest, and continue to send tens of millions of individual payments out to buy the passivity and complicity of its citizens. So what is the solution? Of course the solution would be for our economy to produce more small businesses and more full-time jobs so that more people could achieve economic independence. Sadly, right now our system is steadily killing full-time jobs and small businesses, and there does not appear to be any hope for a major turnaround any time soon. At this point, the number of Americans that are financially dependent on the government is absolutely staggering, and it gets worse with each passing year. Just consider the following statistics which come from one of my previous articles entitled 21 Facts About Rising Government Dependence In America That Will Blow Your Mind 1. Back in 1960, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages was approximately 10 percent. In the year 2000, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages was approximately21 percent. Today, the ratio of social welfare benefits to salaries and wages is approximately 35 percent. 2. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 49 percent of all Americans live in a home that gets direct monetary benefits from the federal government. Back in 1983, less than a third of all Americans lived in a home that received direct monetary benefits from the federal government. 3. Overall, more than 70 percent of all federal spending goes to dependence-creating programs. 4. According to the Survey of Income and Program Participation conducted by the U.S. Census, well over 100 million Americans are enrolled in at least one welfare program run by the federal government. Sadly, that figure does not even include Social Security or Medicare. 5. Today, the federal government runs about 80 different means-tested welfare programs, and almost all of those programs have experienced substantial growth in recent years. 6. The number of Americans on Social Security disability now exceeds the entire population of the state of Virginia. 7. If the number of Americans on Social Security disability were gathered into a separate state, it would be the 8th largest state in the country. 8. In 1968, there were 51 full-time workers for every American on disability. Today, there are just 13 full-time workers for every American on disability. 9. Right now, there are approximately 56 million Americans collecting Social Security benefits. By 2035, that number is projected to soar to an astounding 91 million. 10. Overall, the Social Security system is facing a 134 trillion dollar shortfall over the next 75 years. 11. The number of Americans on food stamps has grown from 17 million in the year 2000 to more than 47 million today. 12. Back in the 1970s, about one out of every 50 Americans was on food stamps. Today, about one out of every 6.5 Americans is on food stamps. 13. Today, the number of Americans on food stamps exceeds the entire population of the nation of Spain. 14. According to one calculation, the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the combined populations of Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. 15. According to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, 43 percent of all immigrants that have been in the United States for at least 20 years are still on welfare. 16. Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid. Today, one out of every 6 Americans is on Medicaid, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. It is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls. 17. As I wrote about recently, it is being projected that the number of Americans on Medicare will grow from 50.7 million in 2012 to 73.2 million in 2025. 18. At this point, Medicare is facing unfunded liabilities of more than 38 trillion dollars over the next 75 years. That comes to approximately $328,404 for every single household in the United States. 19. Back in 1990, the federal government accounted for just 32 percent of all health care spending in America. It is being projected that the federal government will account for more than 50 percent of all health care spending in the United States very soon. 20. The amount of money that the federal government gives directly to the American people has increased by 32 percent since Barack Obama entered the White House. 21. When you total it all up, American households are now receiving more money directly from the federal government than they are paying to the government in taxes. Once again, there is certainly nothing wrong with helping the poor, and there will always be people that need a helping hand. But what we have in America today is far beyond that. What we have in America today is a situation where economic independence is being systematically eradicated and the government is increasingly being expected to provide our daily bread and to take care of all of us from the cradle to the grave. And once you are dependent on the system, at least part of you is going to become resistant to anyone or anything that threatens to bring meaningful change to the system because your survival depends on the system. Or could I be wrong about this? What do you think? Please feel free to share your opinion by posting a comment below This article first appeared here at the Economic Collapse Blog.

"The first to be killed was a jogger, gunned down last September during his daily run in the leafy diplomatic quarter of Bangladeshâ€™s capital, Dhaka. He was identified as a 50-year-old Italian aid worker, and the police say the men who murdered him had been given instructions to kill a white foreigner at random.In October, a Japanese man was killed. In November, gunmen riding a motorcycle pulled alongside a Catholic priest in northern Bangladesh and opened fire, wounding him.For the Islamic State terrorist group, which broadly advised operatives it sent to Europe to kill â€œanyone and everyone,â€ the groupâ€™s tactics in Bangladesh have seemed more controlled. In the past nine months, it has claimed 19 attacks in the South Asian country, nearly all of them targeted assassinations singling out religious minorities and foreigners. They included hacking to death a Hindu man, stabbing to death a Shiite preacher, murdering a Muslim villager who had been accused of converting to Christianity and sending suicide bombers into Shiite mosques.For years, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, has pursued a campaign of wholesale slaughter in Syria and Iraq. And in the attacks the group has directed or indirectly inspired in Western countries â€” including the coordinated killings in Paris and Brussels and the mass shooting inside an Orlando, Fla., nightclub â€” the assailants killed at random.But a closer look at the attack the Islamic State has claimed in Bangladesh â€” and at the fact that it has not claimed bombings attributed to it in Turkey, including the airport attack this past week â€” suggests a group that is tailoring its approach for different regions and for different target audiences.â€œFor I.S. to maintain support among its followers and prospects, it must take different considerations into account when planning an attack in a Muslim country versus non-Muslim countries,â€ argues Rita Katz, the director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which has tracked the groupâ€™s attacks in Bangladesh. â€œI.S. encourages the killing of random civilians in France, Belgium, America or other Western nations, but in a country like Turkey, I.S. must be sure that it isnâ€™t killing Muslims â€” or at least make it look like itâ€™s trying not to,â€ she wrote in an analysis recently published online.The issue of killing Sunni civilians has been a main point of contention with Al Qaeda after the Islamic State broke away from the terror network several years ago. And it surfaced again in the past week.After the triple suicide bombing at the Istanbul airport on Tuesday, a Qaeda official used Twitter to issue a stinging rebuke of the attack blamed on ISIS. â€œThe Turkish people are Muslims, & their blood is sacred. A true mujahid would give his life up for them, not massacre them #IstanbulAttack,â€ wrote Abu Sulayman al-Muhajir, who has been described as an Australian member of Al Qaedaâ€™s branch in Syria, according to a transcript provided by SITE.The Islamic Stateâ€™s uncharacteristic silence about the attacks in Turkey, when it tends to quickly claim bombings elsewhere, reflects the balancing act the terror group must undertake when carrying out violence in predominantly Muslim nations, analysts say.Ms. Katz said the Islamic State â€œhas shown comparable discretion when conducting attacks in other Muslim countries, focusing on government targets, perceived religious deviants and enemy factions, as opposed to random civilians.â€For example, when the terror group last month claimed its first bombing in Jordan, it made sure to identify its target as an American-Jordanian military base. In May, the Islamic State carried out a bombing on a Shiite mosque in Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia. And in January, when it struck in Jakarta, Indonesia, the group took pains to frame the attack as one against tourists, not locals, Ms. Katz wrote.That kind of hedging is more typical of Al Qaeda, which has called on its fighters to avoid operations that would cause mass casualties among Muslim civilians.In reality, though, Al Qaeda, like ISIS, continues to kill large numbers of Muslims in its attacks. But that has not stopped the two groups from arguing about it.The disagreement dates back to at least 2005, when the then-No. 2 of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, wrote a letter of complaint to the head of the groupâ€™s affiliate in Iraq, chastising him for repeated attacks on Shiite shrines, which the Qaeda leadership feared would turn the population against them. The recipient of that letter was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who carried out the strikes anyway. His jihadist branch, Al Qaeda in Iraq, would years later re-emerge as the Islamic State.In the years since the letter to Mr. Zarqawi, Al Qaeda went further. In one speech, Mr. Zawahri advised Qaeda fighters across the world to avoid killing religious minorities, including Christians, and to design operations that minimized Muslim casualties.In 2013, when Al Qaeda loyalists stormed a BP-operated gas plant in southern Algeria, they separated their hostages by faith, releasing hundreds of Muslim workers while holding and killing the plantâ€™s Western employees, a fact they touted in an after-action report sent to a senior Qaeda leader.These tactics were far from perfect: Muslims still died in the Algeria attack, and in numerous others by Al Qaeda, including in their siege that same year at a mall in Kenya, where they asked shoppers to recite Quranic scripture in an effort to separate Muslims from non-Muslims.â€œItâ€™s a very stark difference in approach,â€ says Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies jihadist groups. â€œAl Qaeda wants Muslims to believe that its terrorism is morally justifiable, whereas the Islamic State argues that only its followers have moral legitimacy.â€In the most recent attack attributed to the Islamic State, on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Bangladeshâ€™s diplomatic quarter, the attackers were more selective about their target than the Islamic State tends to be.The bakery is in what expatriates affectionately call the â€œTri-Stateâ€ area of Dhaka, referring to the intersection of three exclusive neighborhoods â€” Gulshan, Baridhara and Banani â€” that are popular with foreigners, said Lori Ann Walsh Imdad, a 45-year-old United States citizen who lives a block and a half from the scene of Fridayâ€™s standoff. â€œWhen you walked by, you would always see someone you recognized,â€ she said, adding that it was founded to provide expatriates with the comfort foods they missed, including American-style bagels and cream cheese.On Saturday, the Islamic State released images of the attackers, describing them as having â€œcharged into the middle of the gathering of nationals from Crusader nations in Bangladesh.â€ While the casualty breakdown is not yet known and it is unclear how many Muslims were killed in the attack, the groupâ€™s description suggested it was eager to pass off the slaughter as aimed exclusively at non-Muslims.Accounts from witnesses said that some of the attackers sought to calm their hostages, calling for Bengalis to come out from hiding and explaining they were only seeking foreigners to kill. Hours later, the gunmen released a group of women who wore hijabs.Though ISIS may have been trying to signal restraint with its attacks in Bangladesh, its tactics are still less targeted than those of Al Qaeda, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism.Al Qaedaâ€™s branch in the Indian subcontinent has focused on killing those they claim have insulted Islam, including secular bloggers.For his research, Mr. Amarasingam interviewed a man he said was a member of Al Qaedaâ€™s branch in the region who derisively compared the groupâ€™s handiwork to that of ISIS. â€œAQ is targeting the best from the best. but ISIS guys killing in jungle, in village, innocent Hindu old guy etc, just to increase the number of claim,â€ read one private message from the Qaeda member that was shared by Mr. Amarasingam.",1
"Muslims Revolt After This State Decides To Ban Shariah Law It appears that North Carolina is the latest state to take steps to ensure that the U.S. Constitution and other state laws are protected from those of foreign cultures. The main concern, of course, is the enforcement of Islamic Sharia Lawespecially during family law cases. Similar measurements have also been taken in Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Tennessee. In Oklahoma, the bill was deemed unconstitutional because it discriminated against a religion. The authors of the bill in NC believe that they have avoided this issue by making sure that the language of the bill applies to all foreign laws. According to BizPac Review, the Christian Action League has spoken out in support of the bill, claiming: There have been more than 50 cases in 23 states in which judges have applied foreign law, depriving people of their constitutional rights. Often women and children wind up the victims when Sharia law is applied. Under the law based on the Quran and the Sunna, the teachings and writings of Mohammed, there is no age requirement for a girl to marry, and acts of adultery or prostitution can lead to sentences of death. Many Sharia law problems in the United States involve cases of women being beaten by their Muslim husbands and judges ruling that because the men were not accustomed to U.S. laws against spousal abuse, they cannot be convicted. What do you think? Is North Carolina right in protecting its court system, or is the measurement unnecessary? ",0
"Responding to growing concerns about the state of offseason renovations to Wrigley Field, officials from the Chicago Cubs assured fans Friday that the stadiums beef machine will be ready for the teams opening game. Cubs baseball has been synonymous with delicious beef for over 100 years, and I can guarantee that the ballparks beef machine will be fully functional in time for the first pitch, team spokesman Julian Green told reporters, adding that construction teams have been working around the clock on the historic 19-foot-tall steel meat grinder in the main concourse, which had not been renovated for decades. The Wrigley beef machine will be bigger, better, and capable of churning out thousands of pounds of flavorful corned beef, roast beef, brisket, pastrami, and just plain old piles of ground beef. Believe me, everyone in the organization understands how important this is for Cubs fans, and weve done everything we can to ensure that they will be happy. Green also sternly refuted rumors that the Cubs will be forced to play their first several games at U.S. Cellular Field, home of the White Sox, in order to utilize the stadiums meat broiler. ",0
"The sale had been expected to be completed as soon as this week. 'Penske Automotive Group ... has decided to terminate discussions with General Motors to acquire Saturn,' GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said in a statement. As a result, 'we will be winding down the Saturn brand and dealership network.' The news is a blow to GM, which had made selling three of its brands, along with shutting Pontiac, a key component of its post-bankruptcy restructuring efforts. GM has come to final terms on a deal to sell Saab to a Swedish maker of exotic sports cars, but it has not finalized the sale of Hummer to a Chinese manufacturer. Instead of selling Saturn, GM will close the brand altogether. It said Wednesday that its Saturn dealers already had signed a 'wind-down agreement.' Under terms of a similar agreement signed by some other GM dealers, all new-car sales operations must cease by late 2010. Penske, which operates a chain of dealerships around the United States, emerged as a buyer for Saturn in early June, beating out several other interested parties, including an Oklahoma-based private wealth fund. The company, which currently distributes the SmartCar in the U.S., planned to continue selling GM-made Saturns at dealerships for the next year or two, by which time it planned to have lined up a foreign supplier to provide new cars badged as Saturns. Although it had found a suitable manufacturer to produce the vehicles, 'that agreement was rejected by that manufacturer's board of directors,' Penske said in a statement. 'Without that agreement, the company has determined that the risks and uncertainties related to the availability of future products prohibit the company from moving forward with this transaction.' There are roughly 350 Saturn dealers. Through the first eight months of this year, they sold 57,223 new vehicles, down 60 percent from the year-earlier period. ",1
"Giants coach Tom Coughlin listed Ahmad Bradshaw at the top of the team's death chart Tuesday, claiming that if the running back continued to miss blocking assignments and drop screen passes, he would face certain execution by opening day. 'From what I've seen so far in camp, Ahmad has been messing up on all the little things that infuriate me,' said Coughlin, adding that Bradshaw's consistency at practice earned him the top spot on the death chart ahead of linebacker Antonio Pierce, who has recently struggled with legal troubles. 'He's really left a lasting impression on me, and if he keeps it up, he'll definitely be the guy that the other players are gunning for.' Coughlin reportedly allowed Bradshaw to take the morning off from Wednesday's practice to say goodbye to loved ones and finish digging his grave. ",0

"To the Editor:Re â€œBlock the Sale of Warplanes to Nigeriaâ€ (editorial, May 18):Your editorial urges the United States government to block the sale of warplanes to Nigeria on the grounds of corruption and war crimes by the Nigerian armed forces. That fails to reflect prevailing conditions in Nigeria in relation to the anti-corruption agenda and accomplishments of the administration of Muhammadu Buhari.President Buhari has consistently demonstrated zero tolerance for corruption, which he considers to be the primary reason behind the daunting social and economic challenges Nigeria faces today. Ending corruption, particularly public sector corruption that has become endemic and systemic in Nigeria, is an ongoing process that cannot be achieved overnight.Concerning the alleged brutality and war crimes committed by the Nigerian armed forces in the fight against the terrorist group Boko Haram, these pertain to activities that supposedly took place under the last administration. These allegations are still being investigated.Since coming to office in May 2015, the Buhari administration has overhauled the high command of the Nigerian military, in addition to moving the army command to the northeast to ensure proper supervision and coordination of the armed campaign against Boko Haram. Also, a Human Rights Desk has been established in the Defense Headquarters to ensure that the armed forces scrupulously uphold human rights as they fight the terrorists and engage the local communities.Contrary to your editorialâ€™s view, these accomplishments constitute a strong basis for the United States to entrust the judicious use of needed armaments to the Nigerian armed forces as they work with the armed forces of neighboring countries (Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger) to decisively deal with the threat posed by terrorists to peace and security around Lake Chad and Northeast Nigeria.HAKEEM T.

"A US missile attack that demolished a compound in Pakistan's tribal belt used by militants crossing into Afghanistan killed 13 fighters, Pakistani security officials said Sunday. A US drone slammed two missiles into the building on Saturday in Saidgi village, seven kilometres (four miles) north of Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan, officials said. 'Taliban have recovered more dead bodies from the debris. We have reports that a total of 13 militants were killed and three injured,' an intelligence official in Miranshah told selfnews on condition of anonymity. 'One of the local commanders, Abdur Rehman, was also killed,' he added. The compound was used by local militants attached to the Haqqani network, which has attacked US troops in Afghanistan, said a senior security official. Other security officials confirmed 13 were killed in the strike, including a local commander, but it was unclear if any foreigners were among the dead. Mosques in Miranshah announced that Rehman was 'martyred' in the strike and that his funeral prayers would be held in Saidgi, an selfnews reporter said. The US military does not as a rule confirm drone attacks, which US officials say have killed a number of top-level militants. At least three suspected US strikes in 10 days have struck North Waziristan, where Islamabad is under growing US pressure to take action against the Haqqani network and other extremists who infiltrate Afghanistan to attack. Some US officials and regional analysts suspect Pakistan's top spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, maintains ties to the group's leader Jalaluddin Haqqani, considering him a useful asset in Afghanistan. In October, Pakistan sent about 30,000 troops into battle in South Waziristan, following a significant campaign to uproot homegrown Taliban from in and around the northwestern valley of Swat. Although Pakistani troops fight militants across much of its semi-autonomous tribal belt on the Afghan border, North Waziristan has seen so far only limited air strikes and no major ground offensive. But the district, along with other tribal areas of Pakistan, has seen a rise in suspected US drone strikes since US President Barack Obama took office and put Pakistan on the frontline of the war on Al-Qaeda. Since August 2008, at least 69 such strikes have killed about 663 people, although it is difficult to confirm the identity of those killed. ",1
"The Football Association has revealed that it will meet City of London police next week as it begins its investigation into alleged corruption. In a week during which Sam Allardyce left his position as England manager, Tommy Wright was sacked by Barnsley and football managers are alleged to have taken bungs in the Daily Telegraphâ€™s investigation, the FA has been frustrated in its attempts to gather information from the newspaper.   Related: LMA demands â€˜full disclosureâ€™ of newspaperâ€™s corruption investigation   An FA statement read: â€œSince these allegations first came to light, The FA has been liaising with The Daily Telegraph and subsequently the City of London Police. The FA treats any allegations of this nature seriously and is committed to investigating them thoroughly, in conjunction with any other appropriate body. We have requested full and unfettered disclosure of all available material from the Daily Telegraph. This is yet to be provided. The FA wants to be in a position to investigate these matters fully at the earliest opportunity and to this end the FA will also be meeting with the City of London police next week.â€ The police have requested a first view of the evidence. The development came on the day Chris Coleman called for anyone found guilty of corruption in football to be banned for life. Speaking in the wake of ongoing revelations about alleged financial wrongdoing, the Wales manager also suggested it was â€œnaiveâ€ to imagine the sport did not harbour malpractice and identified â€œgreed and dishonestyâ€ as being at the heart of the issue. He urged the relevant governing bodies to adopt a zero-tolerance approach towards miscreants and â€œget rid of themâ€ on a day when the latest aspect of the Telegraphâ€™s investigation into footballâ€™s murkier shadows led to Wright, Barnsleyâ€™s assistant manager, having his contract terminated following allegations that he accepted Â£5,000 in return for helping persuade his employer to sign players from a fake Far East firm. Although Coleman had a measure of personal sympathy for Allardyce, he is trenchant on the need to root out malpractice. â€œWeâ€™re all involved in an industry where thereâ€™s corruption from the very top,â€ he said. â€œBut what are we going to do about it if someone is caught? Will it just be a rap of the knuckles or will they be banished? Itâ€™s naive of anyone to think thereâ€™s no corruption in football because itâ€™s everywhere. Itâ€™s not about class or how much you earn. Weâ€™ve seen it in governments and all other sports, whether itâ€™s drug-taking in athletics, cycling or gymnastics. Now itâ€™s bungs in football and weâ€™ve seen the stuff at Fifa. I have zero respect for anyone caught because itâ€™s people stealing money. If anyone is caught, then they should be removed from the game permanently and thatâ€™s it, goodnight. If you earn Â£50,000 a year, thatâ€™s a good salary to the man in the street. If youâ€™re earning Â£50,000 a week then why are you after more? Itâ€™s just greed and dishonesty. If thereâ€™s evidence against someone and theyâ€™re found guilty, then get rid of them from the game. They should never be allowed back.â€ For their part, the FA and the Premier League feel powerless to follow Colemanâ€™s advice until the Telegraph furnishes them with its â€˜uneditedâ€™ evidence. Although this information is understood to be currently in the hands of the police, the League Managersâ€™ Association has effectively accused the paper of delaying the start of a wholesale corruption investigation. Undertaken by the gameâ€™s â€œstakeholdersâ€ this would, among other things, embrace claims that 10 un-named managers have taken bribes in transfer deals. In a written statement, the LMA said it remained â€œextremely concernedâ€ about the reported corruption but the investigation desired by all of footballâ€™s main stakeholders was â€œvery disappointinglyâ€ being held by up the Telegraphâ€™s failure to provide them with its evidence. In a statement of its own, the Telegraph said: â€œTelegraph Media Group said we would release to the FA the relevant transcripts of our investigation into football corruption. It remains our intention to do so. However, the police have asked to review this information first. The FA and the Premier League are aware of this.â€ Coleman is simply dismayed. â€œIâ€™ve never taken a bung and Iâ€™ve never been approached to take one,â€ he said. â€œI canâ€™t say I know anyone who has, but thereâ€™s rarely smoke without fire.â€ While Allardyceâ€™s comments to undercover reporters regarding thirdâ€‘party ownership of players have already cost him his job, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, the Queens Park Rangers manager, is the subject of an internal club investigation after also featuring in the newspaper. The Telegraph alleged the Dutchman requested a fee of Â£55,000 to work for a bogus Far Eastern company seeking to sell players to the club. Hasselbaink denies any wrongdoing and remains in charge of team affairs while QPRâ€™s inquiry proceeds. The club promised a â€œthoroughâ€ investigation but added it has â€œevery confidence in our manager and the robust systems the club has in placeâ€. On Thursday night the newspaper also named the Southampton assistant manager Eric Black in its investigation, claiming that he had been filmed offering advice on giving bribes to officials at other clubs during a conversation that was purportedly about signing players. Southampton accordingly released a statement, which read: â€œThe club immediately requested to be sent, by the Daily Telegraph, the details of this article, but the newspaper declined to share any further information. â€œWe have today contacted the FA and the Premier League, and intend to work closely with both bodies on this matter when the facts become clear. â€œSouthampton Football Club is fully committed to investigating any situation that directly or indirectly related to our club, employees or the wider community.â€",1
"A grass-roots coalition representing the highest socioeconomic stratum of Americans marched on Washington Tuesday to demand that the nation's wealthiest one percent be granted official minority status. Ivana Trump, a leader of the movement to grant the nation's wealthiest one percent minority status. Journeying to the nation's capital from monied enclaves and gated communities across the nation, the marchers gathered on the National Mall in a unified call for 'an end to the discrimination we face daily as members of America's least-recognized minority group.' 'We have been invisible for far too long,' said billionaire shipping heiress Mrs. Winston O. Lathrop, of the Boston Lathrops, in an impassioned speech at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. 'Just because we are among the richest persons on the planet does not mean we are not human beings. Just because we have yachts, mansions and vast corporate holdings in major multinationals does not mean we deserve to be treated as second-class citizens.' Calling the current system of federal support for only certain minority groups 'grossly unfair,' the marchers demanded that the nation's wealthiest one percent be afforded the same benefits other minorities enjoy. 'Public schools, from what my servants tell me, now offer Hispanic and African-American students special counselors who are sensitive to their unique needs as minorities,' said Manhattan socialite Virginia Des Jardins, founder of One Percent Nation, a newsletter dedicated to increasing awareness of minority-elite issues and raising identity-consciousness among one-percenters. 'Where are the counselors who can relate to our special needs? Unless you were raised in an environment with 17 maids, you cannot possibly understand what it's like. And day after day, as the economic gap between us and the masses widens, the situation only worsens, and we become ever more marginalized.' Exacerbating the problem, Dallas-based oil baron H. Milton Endicott said, are affirmative-action programs that give economically disadvantaged minorities preference in hiring and college admissions at the expense of the minority elite. 'Black students are becoming an all-too-familiar site on Ivy League campuses and in the board room,' Endicott said. 'It's getting harder and harder to get accepted to Harvard solely on name alone. All we're asking for is a level playing field.' Marchers, accompanied by their chauffeurs, manservants, and thousands of paid employees, were vocal in their demands for special programs that would help members of the minority-elite live in a society that, as one rallygoer said, 'all too often views us with fear and loathing, just because our massive stockpiles of wealth somehow make us 'different.'' 'People on the street stare at us like we're not the same as themand why?' mining magnate Herbert Lassiter IV said. 'Because of the vast sums we have hidden in Swiss banks? Because we receive dinner invitations from Saudi royalty? Because our ties cost more than their families earn in a year? We must learn to embrace these differences and use them to bring us closer together, not to drive us further apart.' Lassiter also stressed the importance of intervention for at-risk one-percenters, many of whom are driven to low self-esteem and self-destructive behavior by the outside world's great indifference to their plight. 'Misunderstood by a world that sees them as outsiders not to be trusted, more and more of the wealthiest one percent are turning to white-collar crime,' Lassiter said. 'I've seen kids as young as 23 spending up to six months in minimum-security facilities for tax evasion, wasting away in places that offer only the most rudimentary of golf and dining accommodations. That's a hell no young scion should ever have to face.' One-percenters, Des Jardins said, need access to 'safe spaces' where they can nurture and foster their own sense of socioeconomic pride and identity with others of their own kind, free from the disapproving glare of the non-wealthy majority. Educating the masses about the special challenges facing the wealthiest one percent, Des Jardins said, is also vital. Such efforts, however, are only the beginning. 'Until the majority learns to stop their terrible othering of the wealthiest one-percent, there will never be true equality,' Des Jardins said. 'For every one of us, there are 99 plebeians who view us with bigotry and anti-plutocratism.' Organizers called Tuesday's march a 'major step forward' but recognize that the road to acceptance for the ultra-rich will be a long, hard one. 'I look forward to a glorious day when the wealthiest one percent can walk down the street, hand in hand with their lessers, as brothers,' textile heir Julius Worthington White said. 'But, sadly, that day is still a long way off.' 'They look down on us, just because we're superior,' White continued. 'Well, our response is, 'We're here, we're fabulously well-off, get used to it.' We shall overcome.' ",0
"A construction worker died on Friday after falling from scaffolding at the site of a residential development in Brooklyn, in what was at least the cityâ€™s 11th construction death this year.The worker, Wilfredo Enrique, 59, was installing a facade at 325 Kent Avenue, part of the development of the former Domino Sugar refinery on the Williamsburg waterfront, when he fell a number of floors at about 8 a.m., the police said. Mr. Enrique, who had head injuries, was taken to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died.A spokesman for Two Trees Management Co., which is developing the Williamsburg site, said all work had stopped at the location, as investigators worked to determine what had caused the fall. â€œWe are overwhelmed with grief by this tragic accident and extend our deepest condolences,â€ a statement from the company said.The number of people killed and injured in construction accidents has risen as real estate building has boomed in New York City. According to statistics from the cityâ€™s Buildings Department, there were 12 construction-related fatalities in 2015, up from eight the year before, while the number of injuries rose to 472 in 2015 from 237 the prior year.Two construction workers died in November after a steel beam fell on a crane at a work site in Queens.A review of two years of construction accidents by The New York Times in 2015 found that the workers who died were mostly undocumented immigrants, many of whom were working in needlessly perilous conditions. This year, 447 injuries were recorded as of September, the most recent data available.Representatives for the cityâ€™s construction unions, which track deaths differently from the city, said Mr. Enriqueâ€™s death was the 29th construction fatality in two years.There were 138,200 construction jobs in New York in 2015, the highest in four decades, according to the New York Building Congress, a trade group for contractors, developers and designers.The $1.5 billion project at the sugar refinery site, which is scheduled to bring about 2,300 residential units to the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, is on a strip of former industrial land the city has rezoned to allow for high-rise residential development. The old refinery, which had been viewed as a potential development for years, was at the center of a zoning-related dispute that arose between Two Trees developer Jed Walentas and Mayor Bill de Blasio shortly after the mayor took office.The two sides reached a compromise after the developer agreed to increase the number of below-market-rate units in the development to 700 from 660 in exchange for a zoning change that would allow the buildings to rise higher. The project will include office space for technology firms and the expansion of some parkland along the East River.",1

"Kidnap victim Jaycee Lee Dugard has done 'a truly amazing job' raising the two daughters allegedly fathered by her abductor, giving them an education while all three were kept captive in a backyard compound in Antioch, her aunt said Thursday. Dugard, 29, is with her mother, Terry Probyn, her two daughters, ages 11 and 15, and her younger sister 'in a secluded place, reconnecting,' Tina Dugard said at a televised news conference at the FBI's Los Angeles office. 'I was with them until recently,' she said. 'We spent time sharing memories and stories and getting to know each other again. Jaycee remembers all of us. 'She is especially enjoying getting to know her little sister, who was just a baby when Jaycee was taken,' Tina Dugard said. 'Not only have we laughed and cried together, but we spent time sitting quietly, taking pleasure in each other's company.' Jaycee Dugard was 11 when she was kidnapped in 1991 from a school bus stop in South Lake Tahoe, allegedly by Phillip Craig Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54. The couple, arrested Aug. 26, have pleaded not guilty in El Dorado County to a total of 29 rape and kidnapping charges. Dugard's daughters, the older one reportedly named Starlet and the younger one Angel, are faring well and are quite bright, despite never having attended school, Tina Dugard said. She called them 'clever, articulate and curious.' 'Although they have no formal education, they are certainly educated,' she said. 'Jaycee did a truly amazing job with the limited resources and education that she herself had, and we are so proud of her.' She declined to take questions or discuss her niece's time with the Garridos. The reunion between Jaycee Dugard and her mother took place in a hotel in an undisclosed location in Contra Costa County, legal analyst Michael Cardoza said Thursday. Citing a law-enforcement official familiar with the meeting, Cardoza said Jaycee Dugard had asked for privacy and wanted only wanted her mother in the room. The reunion brought hardened investigators to tears, Cardoza said. 'They expected it to be very, very emotional, but they couldn't gauge how emotional it would be,' he said. The attorney said investigators have learned chilling details about Jaycee Dugard's kidnapping on June 10, 1991. The day before the abduction, the Garridos were driving in the girl's neighborhood and saw her with a group of other children, Cardoza said. Phillip Garrido pointed out Jaycee Dugard and said something to the effect of, 'I want that one, the pretty one,' according to Cardoza, citing the law-enforcement official. 'Then they came back the next day,' Cardoza said. 'She was alone, and they grabbed her.' Tina Dugard thanked the FBI, the El Dorado County sheriff's investigators and prosecutors and others for helping to find her niece. 'Their support and professionalism have been invaluable,' she said. She shared three pictures of Jaycee Dugard. One showed her at age 3 at her grandparents' home, another showed her dressed up as 'her version of a punk rocker' in October 1990, and the third showed her with her aunt at a Rose Parade float in Pasadena in January 1991, five months before the kidnapping. This is a 'joyful time for my family,' Tina Dugard said. 'The smile on my sister's face is as wide as the sea,' she said. 'Her oldest daughter is finally home.' ",1
"EU Convenes Panic Meeting Because Trump Might Stop Funding 73% of NATOBy Daisy Luther Why? Because, money, of course. The US money that props up NATO may be coming to an end. During his election campaign, President-Elect Trump described NATO as obsolete. NATO is something that at the time was excellent. Today, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of NATO. (source) American money makes up a disproportionate 73% of NATO defense expenditures.That is something that Trump says hethat he intends to reduce which would force others to put more into the communal money pot if they want Americas continued participation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has warned President-Elect Trump that going it alone isnt a good idea for either the US or the EU: European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: I think that well waste time for two years while Mr Trump tours a world that he is completely unaware of.We have to teach the new president of the USA what Europe is, and how it works. The Trans-Atlantic alliance, and the NATO alliance, is called into question, so it could be quite pernicious.With regards to refugees and other non-Americans, Trump has an approach which in no way coincides with the approach in Europe. (source) Juncker was speaking at a crisis meeting that had been arranged very soon after Trump won the election. It has never crossed the consciousness of any of these people that they have messed up, and they have messed up big-time. They have listened to Angela Merkel, who seems to be the self-proclaimed ruler of Europe, and now they are paying the price. Infrastructures are crumbling, and crime rates are soaring as they sink without trace under the weight of migrants pouring across their open borders. Whats more, this isa situation that they thought the United States would be joining them in until last Wednesday morning. And until last Wednesday morning, they thought that the US would be ponying up to help them. The UK refused to follow the same route as the rest of Europe, and Brexit was the result. Boris Johnson, the UK Foreign Secretary, refused to attend the meeting. He said that the collective whinge-o-rama going on amongst European leaders due to Trumps election needs to stop. Johnsons failure to attend wasviewed as a snub to Europe and a thumbs up to the US. His decision to stay at home on a soggy British Sunday highlights the growing divide between the UK and Europe since Brexit became a reality. A Foreign Office spokesman said: We do not see the need for an additional meeting on Sunday because the US election timetable is long established. An act of democracy has taken place, there is a transition period and we will work with the current and future administrations to ensure the best outcomes for Britain. (source) Finally, Nigel Farage (UK Independence Party) spent acouple of hours in a private meeting with Trumpon Saturday. You may recall that Farage was the engineer of the Brexit movement. He and most of the Brits who voted to exit the EU were pulling for Trump in the election. Dont underestimate this guy, Farage said on Squawk Box. Hes made a big, big success of his business career. And he intends to be a successful president, and I think he may well be. Trumps surprise victory has often been compared to the poll-defying June vote by British citizens for the U.K. to leave the European Union trading bloc. What Trump believes in, as I believe in, is nation-state democracy that we should be controlling our own borders; making our own laws; and yes, trading with each other, cooperating with each other, being good neighbors, Farage said. (source) Trump threatened Brexit times 10, and he delivered it. The EU, still a mess from Britain deciding to leave, is now in a death spiral from which it may not recover. If Europe is looking to lay blame, it seems to me that they needto look no further than Angela Merkel. It was her open-door policies on immigration that drove the UK away and gave the US a glimpse of their future if they elected for Clinton.

De-funding NATO seems to be unmitigated good news on its face. What many wont recognize is the globalists end game of a global military and police force means these kinds of moves towards an isolationist US are being done to create a vacuum for new systems that dont answer to any type of democratic form of governance. esp true given China is poised to fill a large percentage of the vacuum. Totally true. Im right there with you. Its all a bit premature though. Trump is saying hes going to do but he hasnt received The Lecture yet- that cozy little sit down they do with The New Guy and tell him how the game is to be played. Its a long time to January but they are laying out the clues like chess pieces. I dont believe he wouldve been allowed to run for POTUS if he wasnt a known entity, compliant lackey, and Kool-Aid imbiber. If there were any doubts whatsoever, he would have been quickly derailed in the manner of Ron Paul and Ralph Nader, or Wellstoned. Ive spent a lot time peering into the catacombs of the elite mindset. As mega control freaks, they wouldnt take any chances. Its an elaborate game of n-dimensional chess combined with nonlinear disinfo. Gotta think like an evil psychopath genius, not easy for most much less sane empaths and wise old souls. Hahaha so true. What I find most interesting is that the timelines are constantly splitting. The day after the election, even though I had no idea who had won (nor did I particularly care) I woke up feeling like the whole world had shifted timelines. Lots of people felt it. This is huge progress for human consciousness. I love this: Ive spent a lot of time peering into the catacombs etc. Me, too. Why do we do this? What are we looking for and why is it so imperative? The day after the election, even though I had no idea who had won (nor did I particularly care) I woke up feeling like the whole world had shifted timelines. Yep, that was me too, exactly! I could feel the tension in the weeks before the election reaching a crescendo. 24 to 36 hours before it was all over, I began to experience a calmness, a letting go. Some of it had to do with communing with like minded enlightened souls (forming some kind of global light network?). Yes, thats it exactly. How to keep the network engaged 24/7 is the goal. But this feeling of timeline spitting only happens outside the matrix. Once you feel it, you cant unfeel it. The day 9/11 happened, I split myself off of the timeline everyone else went down. I learned how to do this on a local level after a severe hurricane wiped out this island I was on in the late 1980s. It split the islands timeline, so I had had this experience once already, then again 9/11. Same sensation as after the election. I describe it as Everything is different now. So again, splitting off the 3D timeline is my goal still working on it on a consciousness level; I get closer every earth day. LOL Thats fascinating and youre amazing, OS. Appreciate the overview and feedback. My pleasure. My dog Reggae has a message for you, she is very wise. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a15441e599c30d5e5651e9fbf922e91ed051c332d3f4624b961b746adf3f633f.jpg Very wise indeed. Awesome pic. Great conversation. I split off the matrix when echalon was being exposed in the 80s. Many come forward and say you were right as they spread cheeks and remove head! 9/11 was no surprise for those who have been expecting some sort of disaster to cause our consciences to be enslaved once again. After komrad klinton and kohorts attempts at a failed anti terrorism bill which the OK bombing did not create there have been attempt after attempt to legislate our own enslavement through what came to be known as the patriot act of all things. Yet patriots have been considered enemies of the state just prior to its ramrodding into the lives of every American. We are heading back to the conscience enslavement of the dark ages with all its witch hunts and legislating of God. Legislating immorality is quite a horror as seen by the current regime, but when men, in the form of a church presumes to legislate God, then Houston we have a huge problem. Legislating ethical and moral principles will hold we the people together, but this is going beyond just principles to the very depths of our freedoms to choose for ourselves. The left has pushed the envelope so far that the right will come out swinging. Especially with the rioting and money mongers support of immorality that will push the right into a corner and they will have nowhere else to turn except legislating God Himself. Pay close attention to what Trump does with the vatican. He already has the evangelical Protestant world, and most of the catholic world wrapped around his finger. All he needs is the proper psycho babbler to create mind warping laws which will take liewyers years to understand and voila no more freedom of conscience. This might take some time, but Trump is moving fast already and the pope is right there with his army of deceivers to give the right push at the right time. Something the vatican has been expert at since 538AD when they stepped up on to the throne of the Caesars. Interesting, masmpg, thanks for sharing those thoughts. I agree with your first paragraph but I dont agree where you are going with We are heading back to the conscience enslavement of the dark ages That is simply not the case for those who choose an alternative timeline. Surely there are those who desire this decent, just as there are those who do not and will not participate in that timeline. We have the option to stand aside, watch it all play out with neutrality, and not allow ourselves to become a part of any of it. The option of withdrawing consent and exercising free will are our two Trump Cards in exiting the matrix. Use them wisely and there is no cause for alarm or fear. I wish your idea about freedom to choose was correct here. I would point you to the dark ages when freedom of conscience was not even an option. Whether anyone believes this or not, most will agree that history repeats itself. When the monarchs lost their kingdoms mainly because of the reformation leading people to think for themselves, and the new world taking shape and the greatest document ever written being put into play, the money mongers immediately declared war on this freedom. Back to the dark ages. Those who did not agree with the powers that be during this time period were murdered, no questions asked. So to believe we will be able to stand aloof, or on the sidelines in a different timeline would be dangerous. Living in the most free nation ever has spoiled US. We say in our minds that it couldnt happen to US. But so did many long lost civilizations that were very advanced in many aspects of life. What is coming is a tyranny never known by this planet! Something that will make the dark ages pale. The French revolution will look like a picnic compared to a world wide church run state government. The NWO is not about civil government. It is about reining in all nations of the world under one church run state, and has been in the planning for millennia. Well there again, you have already chosen what you will experience simply by accepting it as inevitable truth. Surely history repeats but that repeating pattern is based upon cosmic forces and the forces in play now are quite different than they were in the Dark Ages. We have the ability to become enlightened. When people say, We say in our minds that it couldnt happen to US that is not the same thing as thinking, It WILL not happen to me because I choose a different timeline. We have a lot more power than we have been led to believe. This is a fact the powerful try so desperately to keep from us. This event horizon you so clearly envision in your mind is actually how reality is created. Get enough people believing they are doomed and they will be because they are creating the outcome with their minds. This is hard for people to grasp but its the basis of all the occultism you see being enacted by the powerful. Does anyone really ask, How does occultism and ritual actually work? The greatest force in the universe is the unseen, the ether, the life force that creates everything even though scientists refuse to acknowledge it because it cannot be described mathematically. Einsteins Failure if you will. We are part of that ether and we can create peace just as well as the darkness can create dungeons of the mind simply by realizing the power we have to effect change with our intention. Thats all occultism really is: focused intention. Its a numbers game for the collective, but it also works the same for individuals. We all create our reality, every moment of every day. You can choose to create a life of peace or a life of strife, conflict and fear. Earth remains a free will planet regardless of whether we believe in our own free will or not. No dark entity can control you unless you allow it. You can point to millions of victims throughout history as your argument, but you may be missing the very fact they chose their destiny as well. Its tough, I know, but humanity is not a done deal. If you think so, you should stop creating what you do not want. I agree with this but instead of cosmic I prefer divine forces are involved. NOW is our time to be enlightened. Actually the age of enlightenment for USA has peaked and gone. With all the childish idiocy happening all over USA over the TRUMPED up election nonsense and the store bought special interest groups, which we the sheeple are too dumb to realize. . . BLM and the occupy movement'. I believe the American people are rapidly retreating from any chance of any more enlightenment. You are right in assuming that the powerful whom I consider money monger banksters have been keeping people in the dark from the beginning of time. There has always been an an elitist people who have been charismatic enough to usurp just enough authority to dupe masses of people into a group think mode of divide and conquer. What is so startling is that the group will follow their leader to there own demise. Have you ever heard people say that we must reduce population That is the most absurd statement I have ever heard. The ones who promote that idiocy must be the first to be eradicated, BUT, BUT the braindead canon fodder sheeple blindly follow without a second thought. This attitude, or principle is what is fueling the push for world unity, new world order, call it whatever you want to, but in the end our conscience will be enslaved, and we will be forced to follow the group because they have the bigger guns. Unless you are like me. I will lay down my life for the truth. The power of belief is astounding. With we the sheeple in unity against every principle of our blood stained constitution free thinkers like you and I havent got a chance. I know where I am heading. I have a destiny, but I will defend free thinking to my death, while the majority mow down the wrong ideals like good robotic canon fodder sheeple! The majority is never right, so the power wielded through belief will never be with the free thinking minority like you and I. I by no means create what I do not want. I offer solutions to the problem of/to the robot sheeple. They must awaken soon or all will be lost no matter what you and I desire. Freedom of conscience is a universal constant but try telling that to the powers that be. They will do all in their power, and believe me, today they have devices and technology that can not only change our minds, conscience and sub conscience, but they can remove it! The reason I write stuff like this is to try to get people to think for themselves, not because I promote it. I am not disagreeing with you, neither will I ever give up. I just live in reality, and that reality has, is and always will be the fact that the majority is never right and the minority is always punished over it. Very insightful. I enjoy hearing your thoughts. Im good with divine but too many people mistake that word for something religious so I dont use it myself for that reason. But yes, cosmic/divine, same thing. Where you are describing the minority and the majority, I think in terms of consciousness and dimensional resonance, in splitting timelines and alternative dimensions. We might call this Divine/Cosmic Consciousness. Its obvious that the majority of Americans are resonating at a very low frequency, caught up as they are in giving their power away to anyone and everyone who claims to lead them and give them whatever they want or think they need. The (very small) minority give their power to no one, hold it themselves in sovereignty, and therefore resonate on a higher frequency due to their understanding and higher consciousness. This is a process, all are at different levels in this process, some call it Young Souls vs. Old Souls, or soul evolution and young souls are here to have different experiences than older souls. I agree with you that the time to wake up has passed. Its too late because the earth has raised her resonance and made a 5th dimensional reality available to anyone who can meet a fifth dimensional resonance. This fifth dimensional reality is being created by those who can create it. There will be another timeline splitting event. 9/11 was such an event, the earths timeline was split that day and as an occult ritual with this very intent, it was highly successful in that outcome. The point is to be awake and aware of this phenomenon and be prepared for it and be, essentially, ready to go when the timelines split. I dont want to go too much further with this line of thought unless youre following me do you see? Good synopsis. What you are describing as a loss of freedom of conscience is epitomized by the surveillance society, and more specifically, world wide adoption of Chinas Social Credit Scoring system. Every thought, move, purchase, and action punished or rewarded uber Pavlovian-Skinner social engineering. I hope Olde Souls expectations of an escape for those of us who choose another path is realized. The implications of the Social Credit Scoring System is again 1984 Brave New World on steroids/ ball chain of a global totalitarian-tip-toe enslavement forcing the 99% to jump thru these draconian hoops of Consensus Civil Duty essentially the Hive Mind Borg.as were chained between our ears. Exactly, Eddysachs. The late Gr8 Bill Hicks did a satire on this exact instanc as a new president was shown into a room with fat cat banksters shown a film on the RFK assassination from an angle never ever seen before by the general publicthe film ended they asked the new president if he had any questions?(lol)nuff said!?! Yes, that lecture. I remember seeing Obamas face that day. shortly thereafter the gray hairs started appearing. But I always wonder if we know this, why dont they know all it going in? Because theres more I think, some kind of personal blackmail (or Life Insurance as Weiner and The Witch called it) that makes its mark on their soul. Yes indeed, the late Gr8 Bill Hicks is a timeless treasure trove of truth. What do you suppose is the message in the purple suit? Its so Hunger Games. Something very odd here https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013db611afed2e4a234ef3d2a09bba01c8521b25e9bc34ef01d04f2a1f0a35dd.jpg I have no idea, OS. Upside down pyramid? Her Parkinsons was too far advanced, the health problem was becoming a liability is my guess as to why TPTB switched horses. Most of the time were reading tea leaves. LOL I just found this explanation on US News and World Reports, the bastion of globalist BS: Many believe that wearing purple was a show of bipartisanship, a possible call for unity and togetherness in a time of disappointment and political uncertainty. In Clintons Methodist faith, purple represents royalty and penitence. It was also a color of choice for the suffragist movement. Oh, the absurdity! I cant stop laughing. Methodist? Really? So you can be royalty and penitent at the same time simply by wearing purple? I sure hope the people who make this stuff up dont expect anyone to actually believe it. Great catch, OS! Trump represents a high level order of Hegelian synthesis the purple pyramid accented by Bills purple tie. Trumps role in the politics of personality will be to cajole Tea Party anti-globalist types into wading into the dialectical swamp / pool.all lines blurring. P.S. and off topic. Last night I read an email from G. Edward Griffin about his dismay Dane Wiggington is attacking him and his collaborators for putting together a small conference challenging the establishment global warming / climate change narrative. I was reminded of an exchange you and I had about Dane. Is he working the intel program to splinter awakened activists? Hmm Well, thats a complicated topic for sure. I cant remember what we discussed exactly, but my overall feeling about chemtrails is that they are using peoples minds to create them, all done via holographic matrix. At least on one level, they make people fearful and angry. In order to understand my take on it, one has to believe they are using humans as batteries and their thought forms actually run the matrix. Thats quite a leap for most. But running with that idea hypothetically, then Danes constant SHARE THIS INFO WITH EVERYONE takes on a whole new paradigm, i.e. the more people become aware, the more chemtrails there are in the sky. There are many people working on a totally etheric basis to undo chemtrails using earth elementals and other what you could call anti-thought forms, the idea being if they are using us to create them, we can just as easily uncreate them. I have been working on this for a long time myself, based on a webinar I took about a year ago, from a guy who has been able to literally stop chemtrails with his mind. Fantabulous stuff but so intriguing I had to try it myself. I havent seen a chemtrail in over a year. I have stopped reading anything Dane writes, he gives me the creeps anyway. Oh also I just remembered I had caught him quoting a CIA bulletin and using the words as his own. This sent up a big red flag in Raven World. What do you think about all this? When we touched on this issue in the past, I believe you mentioned pointing chemtrails overhead to some people who didnt get it or see them. You speculated there may be a mind job, hypnosis, or whatever going on. I guessed denial and double think. Somehow we got on the subject of geoengineering induced climate change as another example of problem, reaction, solution, Danes alleged arrogant treatment of some activists, and the situation of him apparently throwing Murphy under the bus. Murphy producing What in The World Are They Spraying and the sequel Why. My take is given the new global authoritarian economic system is predicated on climate change, geoengineering makes sense as a tool to disrupt the climate to support the narrative. As well as other motives to spray us with mind altering chemicals, NASAs smart dust, elements for LIDAR tracking, DNA, vaccines (Bill Gates has been funding this), and other biological substances. Clifford Carnicom has been looking at the latter (very strange findings) and is aware of the LIDAR tracking issue. TPTB are entering a period of megalomania insanity, imo. I want to write a more detailed response later this evening, but meanwhile you might want to drop down below the photo of Reggae and pick up on a conversation Im having with masmpg. Yes, I saw that. The discussion is splitting on the n-dimensional chess board as well. Im catching your drift on free will too. TTYL, take your time. Thanks. Yes, now I recall that conversation better, thanks. The case where the people did not see the chemtrails is what made me question the whole subject in the first place. Up to that day I was a total believer. That experience, plus this thing about being able to uncreate them are two very hard pieces of direct evidence for me to ignore personally, and Im forced to find an answer to WTF is going on. What if it is all a lie? I mean the nanobots and the smart dust, the whole cartoon feel of it. Its like a Marvel Comics/James Bond movie in 3D created to program your brain to accept non-stop violence and death right in front of your face! Then you walk outside the theater and its just another normal day, except you are really subtly DIFFERENT for the images embedded within your mind. Thoughts create reality and we are programmed to create the reality THEY want. We can just as easily not create it. This is why I referred you to my discussion with masmpg in re: what are they telling us to create? I just have my doubts about all of it, including all the Dane Wiggedouts, Steven Reptilian Greers, and maybe even the Clifford Carnicoms, all spewing the same negative mind worms. Collective paranoia is huge juju and very easy to create. I feel the same about mass surveillance. They want to project this total control, vice grip on the throat sensation, that they are all powerful and we are all doomed to extinction but first a slow and miserable death! Bleh it all sounds like a high drama with large dollop of desperation. Call me crazy but I just refuse to feel gloomed and doomed. Im not ready to give in and let a teeny minority of minions rule the world, and if there are esoteric means, etheric timeline manipulations, magick incantations and shamanic journeys that need to be taken, then I will undertake them and I have done already. Everyone is so caught up in fear but the reality is that its just as easy to be fearless and work magic, no permit required. The few powerful know its possible, the billions can easily undo it all with knowledge and higher consciousness. But first they have to WTFU. I get what youre saying on a visceral level more than intellectual because I too feel the extremes in absurdity of so-called alt media reporting trapping us in fear cycles rather than moving away en masse from the control gridwhich would be simple and easy if more people would WTFU your lens here is my lens. My stint in high tech med sci showed me enough about the trajectory of technology that I dont doubt most of what we are reading about capabilities and experimentation is likely true. That said, its never the whole story because I also recognize this is also a spiritual war and those of us trying to create new realities are trying to tap into energies that dwarf the clusterk machinations of the powers that shouldnt be. We were born with the necessary eyes to develop a clear vision of who and what we are but the system placed blindfolds on us and used trauma to atrophy that potential anyway, thats a simple metaphor for what Im sensing. Regarding the chemtrails, I will keep your perspective at the forefront of my thoughts on this subject. Although, I noticed the program was modified to obscure the trails in various ways such as doing more spraying over clouds then turning it off as the planes exit, new formulations that are harder to detect and dissipate faster, and more overnight / early morning activity. Some of this was foretold by a whistle blower in contact with The HAARP Report on YT. I wouldnt be surprised if the entire thing was a psy op, nothing surprises me anymore. Though, my instincts tell me these activities are going on. Doesnt mean we are helpless or doomed and I dont think its a good use of our energies constantly analyze it all to death rather than simply be the change and cast of the fear in this window we have. Hope that makes sense. A million thanks for your great food for thought replies which I take to heart for my own expansion. As always, its a pleasure and a honor to share ideas with someone so awake and aware. It really helps to not be the only joker in the deck hehe. Yes, I see all your thinking clearly. With the chemtrail miasma, it certainly is possible its going on over our heads, and if thats the case, then we just take an alternative approach, that being- Yes, perchance all the stuff is raining down on my personal head, but it will not affect my physicality in the least. I learned this principle from reiki master. This is a just a different form of alchemy using the same etheric principles. And then you just detox the crap out of your body and youre good to go. Nanobots Be Gone! Obviously this doesnt help Gaia and the rest of humanity, but you do whatever you can do and call it enough because its better than doing nothing at all. You know, I keep seeing that awful photo of that Marina Witch Woman with with the bloody goat head and I think if they go to all this trouble to drink blood and make spirit cooking sacrifices Why? Whats the point if it doesnt actually turn them into the powerful elite? And how does it work exactly? And why cant we use the same methods to acquire power for the good of all people? We can its just alchemy, and we can do it as well, if not better, than they can. The Mad Hatter said- Everyone wants a magical solution to their problems but no one wants to believe in magic. What have we got to lose at this point? Same here, always a pleasure, OS, and were definitely surfing the same wavelength, same beam of light. Yeah Im in full agreement on using a different form of alchemy with the same etheric principlesthen you just detox the crap out of your body and youre good to go. My strategy exactly. Im gonna stay healthy or die trying! lol I have nothing to lose and one way or another Im earning my one way ticket off the asylum. We do what we can and steer clear of the mind jobsin the meantime nothing ruffles my feathers. The psychopaths and their minions are something else, arent they? They took on twisted unnatural lives and now they are stuck reinforcing their warped vision with more warped acts. In the long run, theyre in a decaying orbit as they burn more precious Gaia gifts to forestall their eventual crash into the yawning gape of entropy and black holes where no light escapes. On the other end of the spectrum, we have the infantilized hypnozombies. By chance, earlier today I was on libertyblitzkrieg.com reading about college students infantile responses to the election results Play Doh, coloring books, and therapy dogs! Its a whacked, out-of-balance system, something has to give, ya know? Im with you, we have nothing to lose by moving our thinking to a place waaay outside of the Matrix box of horrors and bad comedy. My nose is a chemtrail detector. It runs like a faucet whether their chemtrails are visible or not. Recently, the chemtrailers have been spraying more of the invisible variety in Madrid, Spain, albeit visible chems still dominate. However, they also do as you wrote; dump their toxins atop clouds and turn off the poison when criss-crossing blue sky. In Europe, as everywhere else, chemtrails are blatant attacks on Humankind. NATO is involved. Those and/or other monsters ordering poison skies need locked into a chemtrail plane with the sprayers pointing inside. Spray them until chems are exhausted into the plane. Execute any inhuman that emerges alive. Behead all, dead or alive . Thanks for the feedback. I also feel the effects. I agree, this is the most egregious overt assault on us to date, yet only a small percentage of the public is outraged. The cognitive dissonance is frustrating. There is some on-line research about chemtrails. Theyre comprised of 31 or 36 constituents, depending on which researcher. Besides chemicals that are toxic to virtually all organic life (except mushrooms/fungus and cockroaches, maybe) chemtrails also have desiccated red blood cells (probably harboring illnesses ~ there has to be a reason for them) Yes, Ive taken a look at research on the constituents, very strange indeed the various cocktails. In the US, Clifford Carnicom also found desiccated blood cells, DNA, and much more and has made the reports public on his website. Ill include two links if youre unfamiliar with The C",0
"In an installment of the popular segment broadcast Thursday night, ESPNs Sport Science attempted to investigate the natural phenomena surrounding Cowboys quarterback Tony Romos shittiness and provide conclusive explanations for why the Dallas veteran sucks so bad. We always want to highlight the athletes who perform on nearly superhuman levels, Sports Science host John Brenkus said. And really, nobody in sports presents a better case study of a player who spectacularly collapses under the pressure of a professional athletic stage than Tony Romo. The four-minute piece, which used high-tech motion sensors and accelerometers to measure the quarterbacks forced and ill-advised throws, revealed that Romo possesses the exceptional ability to fuck up in just 0.64 seconds. The segment also sought to explain the physics involved in Romo haphazardly chucking a perfect spiral directly into the hands of an opposing cornerback. We observed Romo missing 98 percent of our targets, Brenkus said. While studying the footage, we were able to determine that his capacity to make poor decisions in less than a second greatly influence why hes so imprecise. Theres not a quarterback in the NFL who can make a mistake as quickly as Romo, Brenkus added. The Sports Science broadcast confirmed that Romos numerous boneheaded meltdowns in clutch situations correspond to an abnormally terrible field of vision coupled with an unparalleled knack for sloppily throwing into double coverage. In addition, the show used computer animations of Romos brain to simulate the precise slowness of neural firings required for the quarterback to stand in the pocket and take a sack instead of spotting an open receiver streaking down the sideline. Physicist and local professor Dr. Charles Dunbar, who worked as a consultant on the Sport Science segment, confirmed that Romo has seemed to defy logic with his horrid play over the years. Analyzing tape of the Dallas quarterback throwing four interceptions to the Giants in week eight, Dunbar said he was intrigued by how the human body could be capable of such an utterly shitty performance. It was truly fascinating to scrutinize Romos pathetic struggles on the field, Dunbar said. We are finally starting to unravel the science behind the dumb shit tripping over his own feet and falling down well before the pass rushers arrive. Those in the scientific community interested in studying piss poor quarterbacking truly couldnt ask for a better subject, Dunbar added. ",0
"Decriminalize Drug Possession, UK Experts SayPhillip Smith The report, A Fresh Approach to Drugs, found that the UK is wasting much of the $4.8 billion a year it spends fighting illegal drugs and that the annual cost to the country of hard drug use was about $20 billion. A smarter set of drug policies emphasizing prevention, diversion, and treatment would be a more effective use of public resources, the report found. Some 42,000 people in the UK are convicted each year of drug possession offenses and another 160,000 given citations for marijuana possession. Arresting, citing, and jailing all those people amounts to a lot of time and money for police, prosecution, and courts, the report said. To address these costs, there is evidence to suggest that the law on the possession of small amounts of controlled drugs, for personal use only, could be changed so that it is no longer a criminal offence. Criminal sanctions could be replaced with simple civil penalties, such as a fine, perhaps a referral to a drug awareness session run by a public health body, or if there was a demonstrable need, to a drug treatment program. The evidence from other countries that have done this is that it would not necessarily lead to any significant increase in use, while providing opportunities to address some of the harms associated with existing drug laws, the report recommended. Given its relatively low level of harm, its wide usage, and international developments, the obvious drug to focus on as a first step is cannabis, which is already subject to lesser sanctions than previously with the use of cannabis warnings. If evaluations indicated that there were no substantial negative consequences, similar incremental measures could be considered, with caution and careful further evaluation, for other drugs, the report said. We do not believe that there is sufficient evidence at the moment to support the case for removing criminal penalties for the major production or supply offences of most drugs, it said. Still, policy makers might want to consider lowering the penalties for growing small numbers of marijuana plants to undermine the commercialization of production, with the associated involvement of organized crime. The report also called for a review of harsh sentences for drug offenses, a consistent framework for regulating all psychoactive substancesfrom nicotine to heroinand for moving the policy prism through which drug policy is enacted from the criminal justice system to the public health system. But the Home Office, which currently administers drug policy in Britain, wasnt having any of it. Things are going swimmingly already, a Home Office spokesperson said. While the government welcomes the UKDPCs contribution to the drugs debate, we remain confident that our ambitious approach to tackling drugs outlined in our drugs strategy is the right one, the spokesperson said. Drug usage is at it lowest level since records began. Drug treatment completions are increasing and individuals are now significantly better placed to achieve recovery and live their lives free from drugs.I want to take this opportunity to thank the UKDPC for its work in this area over the past six years. linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0

"Cyprus Postmortems: Part IIStephen Lendman Capital controls limit withdrawals, restrict non-cash transactions, freeze check cashing, and convert checking accounts into fixed-term deposits. Finance Minister Michalis Sarris signed into law a temporary decree. It caps cash withdrawals per person per bank at 300 euros. It effectively ban(s) cheques and control(s) cash outflows from the country. It permits only 1,000 euros per person to travel abroad per trip. Higher amounts require special approval. Business payments are capped at 5,000 euros per day. Others up to 200,000 euros require approval of a special four-member committee. Amounts above 200,000 require similar approval. Distributing company payrolls require supporting documents. Theyre needed for student tuition and living expenses. Theyre required to send funds to first degree relatives studying abroad. Other payments or transfer of funds require the prior approval of the committee, taking into account the liquidity buffer situation of each credit institution in question. It wont be possible to prematurely break fixed-term deposits unless the funds are used to repay a loan within the same bank. As long as capital controls remain, when fixed deposits mature, depositors will only have access to either 5,000 euros or 10 per cent of the total, depending which is higher. Theyre required to put that amount either in a current account or a new fixed-term deposit in the same bank, depending on his (or her) choice. Residual amounts will be kept in the original deposit an extra month. Financial transactions, payments or transfers not finalized before controls were instituted are subject to the same restrictions. Banks are warned not to execute cashless transfers that facilitate the circumvention of the restrictive measures. They apply to all accounts, payments and transfers regardless of currency. Exemptions include: Central Bank internal audit head, Yiangos Demetriou, said measures in place will be reviewed after four days. Expect no loosening any time soon. Whether clever lawyers and accountants find innovative exits remains to be seen. Ahead of reopening, truck loads of euro notes arrived at the Central Bank in Nicosia. They came under heavy police escort. Helicopters hovered overhead. Cash will be distributed among Cypriot commercial banks and cooperatives. Depositors be warned. Eurozone banking is irrevocably broken. Bank-held deposits no longer are safe. Eurocrat diktats can be imposed anywhere. Economics Nobel Prize recipient Christopher Pissarides said Cyprus finds not all nations are equal. He came home end of January. He helped President Nicos Anastasiades campaign. He didnt expect what happened. The way Eurocrats treated Cyprus shows that far from the currency bloc acting as a partnership of equals, it is a disjointed group of countries where the national interests of the big nations stand higher than the interests of the whole. Meanwhile, the haphazard decision-making in the eurogroup continues. It reached a new low. It casts serious doubts on the ability of this group to make the decisions to push Europe forward to financial stability and economic growth. Nicosia looks eerie. Streets are deserted. People are glued to television for late news. There is total desperation. The smiles have gone. Nothing like this ever happened before. Stories circulate about wealthy Russians and others getting overseas calls to move assets and businesses there. The future is indeed bleak. It is not clear what is coming next and from where. The Daily Telegraphs international business editor, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, headlined Cyprus has finally killed myth that EMU (EU Economic and Monetary Union) is benign. The punishment regime imposed on Cyprus is a trick against everybody involved in this squalid saga, against the Cypriot people and the German people, against savers and creditors. All are being deceived. Its not a bailout. Cyprus gets no debt relief. A potential economic death spiral looms. Capital controls shattered EMU monetary unity. A Cypriot euro is no longer a core euro. We wait to hear the first stories of shops across Europe refusing to accept euro notes issued by Cyprus, with a G in the serial number. Violating insured bank deposit security means anyones money can be stolen. Itll happen if creditor state leaders think doing sos in their best interests. Monetary union has become a danger to property. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem calls it a template for future EMU rescues. (U)ninsured deposit holders can expect eventual haircuts. The Dijssel Bomb confirms creditor powers. Theyll impose them if push ever comes to shove. At the same time, the German bloc (lies) about the real cost of holding the euro together. The accord pretends to shield EMU creditor states taxpayers from future losses. The cost of Cyprus new credit line shifts to the ECB. It will have to offset the slow-motion (Cypriot) bank run with its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). Its likely to be a large amount. Much will show up on the Bundesbanks balance sheet and its peers. Itll do so through the ECBs Target2 payment nexus. Money will leak out of Cyprus unless (Eurocrats) encircle the island with razor wire. According to Jeffries Marchel Alexandrovich: In saving 5.8 billion euros, the other euro area countries will likely be on the hook for four to five times more in contingent liabilities. But, of course, the former represents real money that gives politicians a headache; the latter is monopoly central bank money. Ahead of Germanys September elections, Angela Merkel will do anything (to) disguise the true cost of the EMU project. Paul Krugman says Cyprus should leave the euro. Staying in means an incredibly severe depression. Normuras Dimitris Drakopoulos believes no one knows whats coming. The economy could go into a free fall. Cyprus lost its core industry. Its assets equal eight times GDP. Nothings there to replace it. Tourism wont work. EMU membership made it shockingly expensive. Prospective tourists wont know what to expect on arrival. Seizing money irresponsibly was an act of state madness. What happened shows EMU went off the rails. Stabilitys endangered. It should be dismantled before it destroys Europes post-war order. Southern European countries have their own crises. Their denouement will arrive when (they) conclude that recovery is a false promise (and) break free of EMUs contradictory regime. Economist Yanis Varoufakis addressed The Good, the Bad and the Extremely Ugly (Aspects of the Cyprus Deal). The latter two way outweigh the former. The Memorandum of Understanding hasnt been presented. The deal is utterly incomplete. Its unknown what degree and type of austerity will be imposed upon a collapsing social economy. Its almost certain to be an austerian package bound to crush weaker Cypriots. Wiping out foreign depositors will devastate Cypriot banking and tourism. Transferring 9 billion of ELA money from Laiki Bank to the Bank of Cyprus flies in the face of basic banking resolution principles. Doing so reflects Eurocrat tyranny. Its unclear how capital controls will be implemented. Its uncertain theyll work. Cypriot euros are no longer exportable. Restricting them to Cyprus flies in the face of monetary union. Eurocrat demands are exceptionally ugly. They jeopardized sacrosanct deposit insurance guarantees. They compromised Eurozone integrity. They sacrifice(d) the (EUs) single market principle according to which capital controls are verboten. The ugliest part of the deal exposes the illusion of genuine Eurozone-wide banking union. Dijsselbloem said so in no uncertain terms. The combination of (a) the denial of the need to effect public debt consolidation, (b) the derailing of a meaningful banking union and (c) the heavy-handedness with which Cyprus was treated over the past week, spell a new, uglier, state of affairs in Europe. Eurocrats spurned unifying moves. They chose authoritarian/divisive ones instead. Doing so pushes Eurozone countries in precisely the opposite direction to that dictated by political and economic sustainability. I would not be surprised if what happened doesnt reflect a major turning point. It may become the moment in history when Europe moved beyond the pale. It might have been worse. Cyprus state broadcaster CyBC said German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble proposed a 40% haircut on all deposits. Realistically, he added, very little will be returned. Euro expert Bernard Connolly looks prescient. Before its introduction, he predicted the euros failure. He called it a harebrained idea doomed to fail. He said one or more of Europes weakest countries would face rising deficits, troubled economies, and a downward spiral from which there is no escape unaided. When that happens, the country concerned will be faced with a risk of sovereign default. It only remains for it to happen. Expect perhaps eventual EMU collapse.

"Fabienne Jean, a professional dancer who lost her right leg in the earthquake, hopped on her slim left leg through the dusty General Hospital compound on her way to a very important X-ray. Once at the radiography clinic, Jean, 31, wearing a form-fitting black minidress with a chunky lapis-blue necklace, draped herself on the examining table like a fashion model. Then the technician entered and positioned her stump for X-rays bound for New York, where, if things worked out, Jean would be heading, too. 'Maybe my luck is changing for the better?' she said that day, more than two months after she had survived a raging deadly infection by reluctantly agreeing to an amputation. But then began a tug of war between two health care providers over who would get to rehabilitate Jean. Would it be the big New York hospital, whose director of critical care helped save her life five days after the quake? Would be it the small New England prosthetics company, whose foundation has been working since to get her up and about? Or would the two organizations find a way to collaborate? Among Haiti's thousands of new amputees, Jean, who was featured in an article in The New York Times in February, has been singled out for special opportunities because of serendipity, news media attention and her potential as a symbol of Haiti's resilience: if the dancer who almost died rises to dance again, that will resonate, her caregivers believe. But Jean's situation also highlights the way in which many Haitians, like their country, are now dependent on international charity. As Jean sees it, this is largely a blessing -- 'Thank God for the foreigners,' she said -- but it can also be complicated and uncomfortable. The New York hospital, Mount Sinai Medical Center, wants to follow through on its Haiti relief team's involvement with Jean by offering her corrective surgery and rehabilitation. The hospital is petitioning the Obama administration to grant Jean humanitarian parole to enter the United States. It has also found doctors and lawyers to volunteer their services, and a Haitian-American nurse to provide Jean a home in Brooklyn during her treatment. The New England Brace Company Foundation, on the other hand, believes that Jean can and should be treated in Haiti, where she will live. With its prosthetists preparing to fly to Port-au-Prince to fit her with a temporary new leg this week, the New Hampshire-based group does not want to lose her as a patient, for personal and professional reasons. The foundation wants Jean's help in fund-raising, and has considered making her its spokeswoman. For Jean, a dancer with Haiti's National Theater, tragedy has turned into opportunity in a way that dizzies her. During the Jan. 12 earthquake, a stone wall collapsed on her leg. For days afterward, she lay waiting for help in a sea of broken bodies on the grounds of the General Hospital, where Dr. Ernest Benjamin, Mount Sinai's director of critical care, arrived with a medical team. Jean begged Benjamin, who is Haitian-born, to save her leg, arguing that it was crucial to her livelihood. But it was too late. 'It was not an easy decision to amputate, but she was critically ill and further delay would have cost her life,' Benjamin, an intensive care specialist, said. 'Indeed, despite the amputation we feared that we were going to lose her. She was the first patient to have a seizure after surgery. It was heart-wrenching and we promised ourselves that we would do everything to help her if she survived.' Not long after her amputation, though, the General Hospital transferred Jean to a clinic on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. That is when Benjamin lost track of her -- and when Dennis Acton of the New Hampshire group found her in a place he described as a kind of 'squalid homeless shelter for amputees.' Moved, Acton pledged to help Jean walk -- and dance -- again. 'Fabienne has a great attitude,' he said. 'I figured she would be a strong patient who could get back on her feet quickly and be a positive role model to other amputees.' With a team of New England prosthetists now committed to treating about 50 amputees in Haiti, the Nebco Foundation is a newly incorporated group that solicits donations on its Web site, saying: 'No funding is trickling down from the large organizations who have raised over a billion dollars; we need your help to continue!' The article in The Times on Jean moved scores of readers to offer help At the same time, Benjamin, finding Jean again through the newspaper article, proposed that Mount Sinai bring her to the U.S. to continue her treatment, and began preparing a humanitarian parole application. (The Department of Homeland Security has granted parole for medical reasons to scores of Haitians since the earthquake, Matthew Chandler, a department spokesman, said.) Learning of Mount Sinai's initiative, Acton was initially upset because he had just been counseled by disability experts in Port-au-Prince that their guidelines advocate that Haitians be treated in Haiti. Indeed, Handicap International, a leading group here, does not approve of sending Haitians abroad for rehabilitation, even though 'there is little or no rehabilitation system in Haiti,' Lea Radick, a spokeswoman for the group, said. Haitian amputees need low-tech prostheses that can be repaired or replaced in Haiti, she said, adding, 'The work before us involves building local capacity so that injured Haitians will have access to critical services for the rest of their lives.' Doctors at Mount Sinai say that Jean needs additional surgery before rehabilitation. Her stump ends in a thick, scabby scar that is likely to open with friction from a prosthetic limb, leaving her vulnerable to further infections, according to her application to enter the United States. While Jean could potentially get such surgery in Haiti, resources are stretched thin, and Mount Sinai is offering her 'world-class' medical treatment and rehabilitation, Benjamin said. Acton, after considering this, hesitantly agreed that going to New York might be in Jean's best interest. He wrote an e-mail message in late March that he had initially been 'defensive (and maybe a little jealous?)' but that 'Fabienne will never get the care she needs in Haiti.' For a brief period, Acton and Mount Sinai appeared to be working in tandem. He offered to sign an affidavit of support for Jean to accompany her humanitarian parole application. But later, he conditioned that offer on his group's remaining her prosthetic provider, and he said his board of directors was concerned that Mount Sinai was trying to steal a high-profile patient. The cooperation broke down. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) After a frustrating week in Haiti, Benjamin said that he believed the New England group was impeding his efforts to obtain documents needed for Jean's parole application. The group, he said, while likely 'doing some wonderful stuff,' had made an investment in Jean that it did not want to lose. 'Her ability to dance again will help them cash in,' he wrote to his colleagues in New York, proposing that they 'throw in the towel' on their plan to bring Jean to Mount Sinai. Acton said he would make sure that Jean got the care she needed. And he added that he resented the implication that his group was exploiting Jean, whom he said he considered a friend and 'an equal partner' with 'the power to decide how she wants to work with us in her future career, if at all.' He added: 'I am learning the hard way that the disaster zone is more than just destruction and injured people; it is a complex mix of politics, egos and power plays as well.' In the end, Mount Sinai decided to keep pursuing permission for Jean to enter the United States. Separately, Acton prepared to travel to Haiti with her new limb. And, in the middle, Jean, appreciative though stressed, does not want to take sides. But she does want to go to New York for treatment if possible. She said in Creole: 'I want to! I want to! I want to!' ",1
"Montenegroâ€™s long-serving prime minister is to step down, the governing Democratic Socialist party has said, and will be replaced by his deputy, DuÅ¡ko MarkoviÄ‡. Tuesdayâ€™s announcement came hours after Milo ÄukanoviÄ‡, who has governed as Montenegroâ€™s prime minister or president for a total of 21 years since 1991, announced his government was investigating a possible Russian role in an alleged 16 October coup plot aimed at derailing the countryâ€™s elections. It is unclear whether there is any connection between ÄukanoviÄ‡â€™s claims of a coup and his abrupt departure. Party officials were quoted as saying that he would be replaced by MarkoviÄ‡ as its candidate for prime minister if it was able to secure a majority coalition in post-election negotiations. ÄukanoviÄ‡, whose time in office has been dogged by allegations of authoritarianism and corruption, has retired from leadership on two previous occasions, in 2006 and 2010, before returning to the helm. ÄukanoviÄ‡ had said there was a â€œstrong connection of a foreign factorâ€ in the alleged conspiracy to take over the Montenegrin parliament on election day, adding that the countryâ€™s authorities would investigate the extent of involvement of Russia and Serbia. Twenty people, including the former commander of special police in neighbouring Serbia, were arrested on the day of the would-be coup attempt. The Serbian prime minister, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, announced on Monday night that Serbian police had made more arrests of people suspected of following ÄukanoviÄ‡ and planning unspecified crimes in Montenegro. â€œWe have seized uniforms, money and other things, and have informed the special prosecution in Montenegro of what we know,â€ VuÄiÄ‡ told a press conference. He said the suspects had no connection to the Serbian state but did have ties to an unnamed third country. Russiaâ€™s security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, was expected in Belgrade to hold talks with Serbian leaders in the wake of the arrests, according to reports from the Serbian capital. Those reports said Patrushev had come to discuss terrorism, the migrant crisis in Europe and alleged extremism in Kosovo. ÄukanoviÄ‡ faced stiff opposition from a pro-Russian coalition opposing the countryâ€™s proposed membership of Nato. Leaders of the Democratic Front made frequent visits to Moscow in the run-up to the election. ÄukanoviÄ‡â€™s party won the vote, but not an absolute majority, and Montenegroâ€™s Nato membership is awaiting ratification by member states. Bratislav DikiÄ‡, the former commander of the Serbian gendarmerie who was arrested on 16 October in Montenegro, has denied involvement in any coup attempt, saying Montenegrin police had planted a phone on him as well as keys to a warehouse containing weapons.   Related: Cold war 2.0: how Russia and the west reheated a historic struggle    The Montenegrin prosecutorâ€™s office said last week it had reasonable suspicion that a criminal group had been formed in Serbia and Montenegro with the intention of attacking the police guard at the parliament in Podgorica, taking over the assembly and declaring the winner of the election.  Seventeen years after the Kosovo war, the last of the conflicts that marked the disintegration of Yugoslavia, tensions are still high in the region. Serbia, backed by Russia, refuses to recognise Kosovoâ€™s independence, while Bosniaâ€™s sovereignty is under constant pressure from Serb and Croat separatists. Stjepan MesiÄ‡, a former Croatian president, claimed that leaders of both communities were seeking to break up Bosnia, warning that it could lead to a new war.   Adding to the febrile atmosphere, the Serbian government announced that an interior ministry official had been arrested for contacts with western intelligence. The interior minister, NebojÅ¡a StefanoviÄ‡, said the authorities had â€œneutralised this person through effective actionâ€ but gave no further details.",1
"SAN ANTONIO, TXSitting on a barstool at the Stone Werks Tavern, Barry Todd, 39, made a general inquiry regarding the status of the ladies Monday. 'So, what's the deal with the ladies tonight?' asked Todd, speaking to no one in particular. 'Are they alone, or are they here with somebody? I hope they're not all uptight and stuck-up.' After receiving no definitive answer, Todd spent the remainder of the evening flipping through the CDs on the jukebox and nursing his warm Michelob Light. ",0
"Cradle to Grave: How Dirty Business Has Destroyed Small Town AmericaOp-Ed by Phil Butler I kiss the soil as if I placed a kiss on the hands of a mother, for the homeland is our earthly mother. I consider it my duty to be with my compatriots in this sublime and difficult moment. Pope John Paul II The multinational corporations of this world are the problem. Many of you have probably already come to this same conclusion. Americans have acquiesced in promoting the fallacy that huge conglomerates are some kind of necessary evil. Few Americans realize that lawmakers have sold out individuals to the bankers. To illustrate this, we take the example of a small town in Southern Georgia, which represents the betrayal of all of America. It is a long story, but well worth your time. That is, if you ever want your country back. While Donald Trump and other politicians demand that we all take America back, it is you and I who must do what is necessary to regain the America that once was. The term Cradle to Grave is used to describe the environmental life cycle of a product. In a bitter irony, it is also business parlance for treating humans as a commodity to be exploited. I recall the first time I became aware of this, when my father first spoke of it at his law offices in Jesup, Georgia in 1974. Well, they have managed to commoditize us finally. He added, Instead of personnel, we are resources for big business to use up, I recall him saying chidingly. And while few took notice of such things back then, my dad was always reading, discerning, assessing law, and especially the US Constitution. He would use the occasion to teach: Let me illustrate something for you, before we move on. Some of you may recall that employers used to have personnel departments, which were later transformed into human resources. Human resource experts of today are taught in college how this was some kind of noble business experiment. This is reflected in a recent report from Science for a Smarter Workplace, by Terranova Consulting Groups Karen E. May: The shift from personnel to human resources, for example, was part of the movement to acknowledge the value of employees as an organizational resource Maybe readers will catch the distinction, or the paradigm that emerged when big business altered its dogma. The difference between a department that deals with employees, and a resource that can be weighed, categorized, shuffled, stamped, signed, sealed, and delivered. The English teachers amongst you should be the first to grasp the full meaning. In the early 1970s, Americans leapt into a spiraling crevasse, without even knowing. This is where we were made into resources, which is of course a euphemism for slaves. Please think about this, as I continue to build a case against the likes of Republic Services and others. In 1973 and 74 America went through some major changes. From the Nixon Shock to that presidents resignation over Watergate, everything about our society changed. While dramatic at the time, most of this change took place on an almost subliminal level for the average American. Roe vs. Wade made abortion legal. The 26th Amendment to our Constitution allowed 18-year-olds the right to vote. We launched Skylab, the first space station, and created a hundred other firsts. In 1975, while all of us at Wayne Country High School were thinking about dates, fun and finally escaping from the drudgery of education, Bill Gates founded Microsoft. In 77, the Commodore became the first home computer. Elvis died in 77 too. Encapsulating what the seventies was all about is painstaking, but historians agree that the 1970s were (if anything) a pivot of change. In terms of world history it was about economic upheavals. Yuppies, the me generation came about as a result. We really started to think about mainlining (a drug term) super-capitalist ideals. And corporations fed us all we could stomach. Those history lessons you hated in high school and college, the nightly news reports you were too tired or stoned to watch, they foretold a real Orwellian nightmare. The oil embargo of 1973 by theOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) affected me personally, and oh-so harshly. My little orange Mercury Capri, that me and my pals scooted to the beach in, now cost $6 dollars to fill up rather than $3.50. But in reality, my dad gave me a charge account at Purcells Union 76 gas station (or was it Exxon?), so the misery was deferred. But the gas crisis was not about Arabs wanting more money, or punishing America for meddling in Arab affairs. 1973 was about a new kind of economic world, something known as neo-liberal economics. The end result of this revised economic theory is best expressed by citing the Wikipedia entry: The implementation of neoliberal policies and the acceptance of neoliberal economic theories in the 1970s are seen by some academics as the root offinancialization, with the financial crisis of 200708as one of the ultimate results. For the sake of brevity (and your sanity), we will simply say that the forms of neoliberal economic changes seen in the 70s and early 80s were the highest form of hyper-capitalism. And in the end, as we are seeing, the results of turning the corporate dogs loose are turning disastrous. But our story here is not about graduate level economics, its about a Southern Georgia community, and how laissez-faire or free market capitalism has affected society, especially at the local level. We all wanted to be Yuppies, and to have it all; now let me show you how our leaders drugged us into a capitalistic overdose. The last four decades have been a failed experiment in what the famous neoliberal German philosopher and economist Franz Oppenheimer would call the merging of the political state and the corporation. The form of socialism he and others proposed combined the political and economic means to fulfill every Yuppies desires. Yes, while we were busy coaching basketball or attending PTA meetings, other forces were at work. While you and I earned and spent fortunes living the American Dream, our enslavement was being chiseled into the system. The theorists behind this enslavement were at first in a heated battle with people like consumer advocate Ralph Nader. It is irrefutable what effect neoliberalism had on our society. The deregulation of the financial sector through the passage of theCommodity Futures Modernization Act, the repeal of theGlassSteagall Act, and later Bush-Clinton era disguises for neoliberal values, led us into our current mess. Militarism, deteriorating family values, and especially ecological malfeasance mark the synthesis begun in the early 1970s. Now we have had our socio-economic history lesson, we can more intelligently assess what has happened in the South I grew up in. Let me show you a small town called Jesup, Georgia, and how deregulation and free market madness have affected my friends there. Republic Services has a dirty job. The second largest non-hazardous solidwaste managementcompany in the United States, afterWaste Management, Inc, it has to get rid of not just our garbage, but the unwanted byproducts of our free market capitalism. The corporate executives who sit in offices on the 4th floor of Republic Services headquarters must lay awake at night perplexed by every decision. I am sure Republics President CEO Don Slager spends countless hours in discussions about alternatives to the opportunism evil corporations are always known for. He probably goes to church on Sunday, and prays that his god (note the little g) will forgive the hard decisions he has to make in order to please billionaire stockholders like Bill Gates (see Cascade Investments), F.William McNabb III (see Vangaurd Groups $3 trillion dollar man), Franklin Templeton Investments, Joseph L. Hooley (see State Street Corporation investments in Republic), and dozens of other vested interests in Republic Services (RPG). Digest, first, my reasons for cynicism. Believe me when I say that most of the people and institutions mentioned above are inextricably linked to the 1970s neoliberal shift I showed you. But in researching all this, I found a name and an association that ties my argument for a lost America in a nice, tight, empirical knot. Wallace L. Nutter is the second biggest individual investor in Republic Services, behind the CEO Don Slager. Nutter is also on the board of directors of another company important to Wayne County and Jesup. The company is simply called Rayonier in Jesup, but stock investors will know it as Rayonier Inc. Rayonier, for those of you unfamiliar, built the (then) largest paper mill on Earth in Jesup, Georgia back in 1954. Wayne Country residents will understand where I am going now, but the casual reader may not. Every kid who ever lived in Wayne County has memories of the burning rubber stench of this paper mill, of the massive pollution over the years, of the impacts of huge business both good and bad. Rayonier helped Wayne County thrive in a consumerist age. Rayonier has played a pivotal role in socio-economics in Jesup. The company at times run roughshod over any who would criticize or condemn even its most repugnant offenses. The giant paper mill embodies everything that went wrong about the United States. Regulators have, for decades, given an almostfree rein to Rayonier, a plant that uses 72 million gallons of Altamaha River water a day. Walter Nutters investments are indubitably safe, insured as it were, by the people sworn to protect citizens health and well-being. The corporate heads of this company effectively ruled Jesup and Wayne County, right alongside railroad executives and the local politicians owned by the likes of Georgia Power, Southern Company, and so on. But it was people like Wallace Nutter that empowered Rayonier, and now empower Republic Services, to use us. Wallace Lee Nutter is Chairman at J.M. Huber Corp. and Independent Director at Republic Services, Inc. Hes also on the board of directors of the American Forest Paper Association, Inc., the National Council for Air Stream Improvement, Inc., and Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. Nutter was also an independent director of NiSource, Inc. and at SunTrust Bank. The coal ash Republic Services wants to bury at the company landfill site outside Jesup will have a dramatic ecological effect. Republic Services cannot prove that the toxic waste produced by Georgia power plants will not. Anyone being able to prove that a landfill liner will not leak, FOREVER, is inconceivable. And beneath this landfill to the south of the city, is one of the most important aquifers in the state. The wetlands Rayonier took advantage of for more than half a century to the North of Jesup entrap Wayne County families between past and future corporate malfeasance now. At least this is my objective view: Georgia Power needs to resolve its legacy of coal ash pollution, and Wayne County Georgia is the graveyard for that companys hyper-capitalist profiting. The same town Rayonier sold big industry to is about to be finished off with the last gasps of American greed. I cannot lay off Mr. Nutter here. What he symbolizes is every bad think I ever heard happened to an innocent friend. From the schoolyard bully to the politics of race, popularity or social status, the predators of this world come in many shapes and sizes. It is not Bill Gates reaping vast fortunes off of us that bothers me, for these billionaires would be nothing without the Nutters of this world. The 10 million or so Nutter has invested in 4 or 5 key funds has been multiplied 100,000 times by his clones. The Nutters of this world are the ones who really own us. Bill Gates and the Warren Buffetts of this world are penniless by comparison. Let me show you how people like this operate, via some of Wallace Lee Nutters investments: Wallace Nutter owns roughly $3,879,755dollars worth of stock in an energy company called NiSource, Inc. This company was criticized back in 2011 for paying zero taxes, while at the same time paying $1.83 million for lobbying and raking in $227 million dollars in tax rebates. This is to say nothing about the companys role in natural gas fracking and its environmental dangers. Wallace Nutter owns about $4,369,996in stocks of a NiSource offshoot, Columbia Pipeline Group Inc(CPGX). News last week (Wall Street Journal)that TransCanadaCorp. intends to buy this company in order to end run US legislation on the infamous Keystone pipeline is all you need to know here. Wallace Nutter has been chairman of the J.M. Huber Corporation since 2006. One of the largest family-owned businesses in the United States, this company produces a variety of products that go into everything from toothpaste to food starch. Its a global company, with a massively growing footprint. Finally, Wallace Nutter is not unlike other familiar rich folks such as Bill Gates, or even the notorious George Soros. His investments in industries that always skirt environmental law are counterbalanced by his positions in bodies supposedly designed to monitor such legalities. A good example is his position on the National Council for Air Stream Improvement, Inc. This position mimics George Soros alleged efforts at fostering democracy via his Open Society Foundations. Nutter is joined in his passion for crystal clear stream waters by executive colleague Daniel S. Fulton, who is associated with anything and everything to do with real estate, timber and the unsustainable development America has seen over the last 40 years. Fulton was the President CEO of Weyerhaeuser Realty Investors Corp., CEO of Cornerstone Columbia Development Co., Executive Vice Chairman of Weyerhaeuser Co. and President of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co. and also the American Forest Paper Association, Inc., the National Alliance Of Forest Owners, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc, and more. The linkages between these businessmen are astounding, and reading the network is like literally walking on the corpses of environmentalist and consumer advocates. Its the murky stench of rancid water that flavors all you have read so far. Water, being so crucial to our planet and our survival, is just something we have all taken for granted for too long. And the water in the ground, that leading from the Republic Services landfill in Wayne County, will carry the next disaster heaped onto small town America. The economic stresses Ive mentioned do not even come close to conveying the seriousness of Americas acute instability, which has been caused by these investors and their corporations unsustainable growth ideologies. Neither Wallace Nutter nor even Bill Gates seems concerned with the legacy being left to Americas grandchildren. I can hammer these industrialists and entrepreneurs into the ground deep as fence posts here, but the simple fact is that Wayne County Georgia is about to be in a horrible mess. And an irrevocable one too. Ill leave the reader with this report from the US Geological Survey concerning something called groundwater depletion. To save you time, the report paints a nightmarish picture for many regions of the US, especially when you consider the pollution of what is left of this rapidly diminishing resource. In Southern Georgia, South Carolina and other regions, never before has water been in such demand. Even if the coal ash dumped into the Republic Services landfills were only moderately harmful, the concentrations found in aquifers (if and when there is a leak) will be higher than the industry can foresee. My high school chemistry teacher (Mrs. Shaw at Wayne County High, I think) taught us about the dilution of compounds in liquid. Well, the same Altamaha River which Rayonier has puked compounds into for generations does not have the flow volume it once did. Look at the course of desertification globally. Study groundwater anywhere from California to China, and youll find people thirsty for humankinds most valuable commodity. And Republic Services is willing to screw with it, in Wayne County Georgia today, and your town tomorrow. Their science is based on profit and growth, and Bill Gates or Wallace Nutters dividends and shares. Jesup, Georgia is a pristine example of how Americans were first transformed into willing slaves, then whipped into neoliberal hyper-consumer frenzy, then abandoned by a failed system, then delivered the death spike before it became an utter ghost town. All this is a mouthful, I know. It took me two days to research this, so I fret not for your ten minutes or less reading it. What is important to take away is how wrong we have all been. The blame for small town Americas decline must be shared by those of us who turned a blind eye as well as the pitiless investors who so callously ruined it. As for burying millions of tons of coal ash in Wayne County, this really does spell the end for a way of life. I urge you to do your own research; do not even take my word, when it is the future of your children at stake.

"New Report: Suicide Kills Almost 5 Times as Many U.S. Troops as Combat DoesBy Amando Flavio The disturbing report is the DoD 2014 calendar year Suicide Event Report (DoDSER), which details the number of suicide attempts and deaths of United States service members. The report only focused on the 2014 calendar year. According to the details, in all of 2014, a total of 55 United States troops, in both hostile and non-hostile situations, lost their lives in foreign occupations. On the other hand, the number of soldiers who killed themselves is nearly 5 times this number. The DoDSER revealed that in 2014, there were 269 deaths by suicide among active component service members. This figure was slightly higher than the previous year. In 2013, 259 suicide deaths were recorded among troops on combat missions in abroad. Since the 2014 report was made public, some observers have expressed grave concern about the increasing rise of suicide death among service members. Observers say that apart from even the active members taking their own lives, when they retire from the service, the situation worsens. This observation made by commentators is true, looking at the statistics below. In a 2012 report put out by the Veterans Administration, it was estimated that up to 22 veterans a day, kill themselves. That is 8,000 lives a year; almost one per hour. For attempted suicides, the number skyrockets to 19,000 attempts, of which 8,000 result in ending their own lives. Observers acknowledge that there are a number of factors contributing to this increasing rate of suicides, but they argue strongly that the major cause is the trauma from war. Due to the killings and the destruction of human lives involved in war, the consequence is huge. Some service members (both active and ex) experience nightmares, disturbing them to the point that they have no option than to take their own lives to put an end to the suffering. Many ex and current servicemen have told ofsome of these horrible experiences. A honorably discharged veteran of the United States Marine Corps, Matt Agorist who has been very critical of wars waged by the United States on foreign lands, wrote on the Free Thought Project that service members are used and discarded by the few elites who sit in Washington DC, authorizing needless and useless wars for their own selfish gains. Our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and mothers and fathers are contracted by the state and used as cannon fodder for special interests and the expansion of imperialism. Those who refuse to join are enslaved into the ranks via conscription, and the rest of society calls those who fight this conscription, cowards. When the state is done with its pawns of empire, it disposes of them like spent military gear, Agorist wrote. From a holistic perspective, its clear that Mr Agorists assertion is the hard truth. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that nearly 50,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. Another 140,000 are currently in jail, many of them for victimless crimes like drug possession. The statistics also shows that veterans are often the target of unjust attention from law enforcement. It is even said that on multiple occasions, the Department of Homeland Security has referred to veterans as potential terrorists, noting that they pose a real threat to national security.

Why fight for these NWO skunks like Kissinger let him be his own brute beast stay at home and refuse to murder or Obama . Agree. Can you imagine the torment these youngsters go through when they see the results of their naivet to the lies/treachery of the Judas Class and their Synagogue owners? Even if the vanquished want peace the american military will still blow them to bits . the reason is obvious, what they are doing is training ordinary people to be serial killers, and it is against their nature, they realise that they are not defending their country, but their country wants them commit premeditated murder, and these faceless gutless wonders who handing out the orders, are about to have a few surprises coming their way, This Draco Reptilian New World Order will soon face the wrath of the world. I will bet that when the troops come home and they are having difficulty with war issues, the first thing their doctor does is get them on Prozac, Zoloft, or one of the other similar drugs to help them with depression. Those drugs should be last resort. People that take these drugs become addicted in a short time because trying to get off them results in misery. Even the calmest person trying to get off those drugs can become violent and/or suicidal. So, you can imagine how side effects getting off those drugs would effect those with PTSD or other war aliments. In Sewer Nation, when it comes to medicine the moneys in pushing pharmaceuticals. Prozac, Zoloft, and the other similar drugs cause much of this suicide. Never start these drugs unless ordered to do so by court order. These drugs, besides causing intense feelings of suicide and/or killing people they also kill your se x drive 100% and it will never come back. Just check youtube and you will find proof that that. Just recently India surpassed this oligarchy in number of citizens with access to the web. that puts the U.S. in a tenuous 3rd place. Overall, we have third-world hard wired/wireless web access to match our rotting infrastructure (D-Minus in 2009). Couple that with the obscene prices for access and you have a very good way of keeping the people ignorant of the facts of a matter. The fact is, there are lesser? nations around the globe who PROVIDE net access to their people. The most disgraceful thing in all this? Thanks to the U.S./City of London all but 4 or 5 nations on Earth now have Central Banks raping and pillaging legally. You dont think all those hundreds of military bases in over 100 nations are there for the sole purpose of simply stealing resources, controlling governments, keeping their markets friendly for our corporations do you?

"Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, dropped a memorable line at the end of his letter this week recommending no prison time for Peter Liang, the former New York City police officer convicted of manslaughter last month in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in a housing project stairwell.â€œThere are no winners here,â€ he wrote.Mr. Thompson was referring primarily to the two chief players in the tragic drama: Mr. Liangâ€™s victim, Akai Gurley â€” â€œa completely innocent man who lost his life for no reasonâ€ â€” and Mr. Liang himself, who has already lost his job and who stands to lose his freedom when he is sentenced next month.But along the way the case has had winners, and losers, though it has at times been hard to tell them apart. When Mr. Thompsonâ€™s letter was released on Wednesday, Mr. Gurleyâ€™s family and criminal-justice reform activists expressed outrage, just several weeks after having applauded Mr. Liangâ€™s conviction, and before that his indictment. In a stark but mirroring contrast, the cityâ€™s police unions and many in its Chinese-American community denounced the indictment and conviction, but they are now praising prosecutors and cheering the prospect that Mr. Liang, who is of Chinese heritage, might avoid prison.If the best settlements are those in which each side leaves unhappy, then it could be that Mr. Thompson has himself emerged a winner, if a battered one, near the end of the sort of polarizing police misconduct case that can define a district attorneyâ€™s career. A first-term prosecutor with electoral potential, he had much to lose by even pursuing the case, which was fraught from the start with legal hurdles and political pitfalls.A blameless man had been killed by the police, but the officer was not one with a history of violence or who had obviously acted out of malice. Instead, he was a rookie officer on a dangerous assignment who had only recently left the Police Academy.In the end, Mr. Thompson has arguably managed to get the best he could: praise and fury from nearly everyone involved.What is all but impossible to divine is how, or even whether, Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, weighed the unofficial but unavoidable considerations: the politics of a diverse borough that made him the first black district attorney in Brooklynâ€™s history; the tension that prosecutors face in weighing justice and mercy; and the powerful influence of the Police Department, whose officers work closely with him and his staff and which once counted his mother among its ranks.Or perhaps, Mr. Thompson, who declined to be interviewed for this article, just went with his gut.â€œProsecutors face enormous pressure,â€ said Representative Kathleen M. Rice, a Democrat who once served as the Nassau County district attorney. â€œIf youâ€™re not prepared to be disliked by one or both sides in a criminal case, then being a D.A. is probably not the job for you.â€From the moment in November 2014 that Mr. Thompson learned of Mr. Gurleyâ€™s death â€” by a ricocheting bullet in a dark stairwell of the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York â€” he found himself confronting bedeviling facts: the innocent victim, the broken lights in the notoriously dangerous housing project, and the inexperience of Mr. Liang and his partner.On the other hand, as Mr. Thompsonâ€™s prosecutors pointedly noted at the trial, Mr. Liang and his partner failed to assist Mr. Gurley even after they realized the bullet had actually struck someone.Politically, Mr. Thompson faced a mix of competing constituencies, none of which were timid in expressing their opinions. Much of the police force, which carries out most of the investigative legwork for a district attorneyâ€™s prosecutions, said Mr. Liang should not be indicted. Large swaths of the cityâ€™s growing Asian-American population expressed the same sentiment.At the same time, the shooting came only four months after the death of Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, who was killed in an encounter with the police on Staten Island. The case fueled protests in New York and across the country, especially after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who had placed Mr. Garner in a chokehold, which was a cause of his death.Adding to the already considerable pressure was Mr. Thompsonâ€™s own biography: He was both Brooklynâ€™s first black district attorney, who had campaigned as a reformer promising to restore a sense of fairness to communities of color, and the son of a police officer who understood, from personal experience, the exigencies of police work.â€œHe was in an extremely difficult spot because he had to reconcile a number of different interests,â€ said Alan Vinegrad, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Thompson in the late 1990s on the Abner Louima police brutality case. â€œForget about the politics, strictly from a do-the-right thing perspective, it was hard to achieve justice for the victim.â€For nearly a year and a half, Mr. Thompson has been saying that his decisions in the Gurley case have been driven by the evidence, not politics. And yet it remains that the office of district attorney is an elected one. Even many of his loudest critics, including those, like Mr. Liangâ€™s lawyer, who thought that an indictment should never have been brought, have said his sentencing decision was at the very least reasonable.Mr. Thompsonâ€™s letter is only a recommendation, and the final sentencing decision rests with Justice Danny K. Chun of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, who could give Mr. Liang as much as 15 years in prison.But by urging only probation and a brief period of house arrest, Mr. Thompson, wittingly or not, has created a situation in which a sentence that includes any time behind bars could seem a tough penalty and perhaps mollify some of those who opposed his recommendation.Whatever political fallout there is from his decision is likely to emerge only in time as he seeks re-election or tries for higher office. As People v. Liang returns again to the courthouse for the sentencing on April 14, legal questions will take precedence.â€œDid the officer win? No,â€ Mr. Vinegrad said. â€œDid the victim win? Obviously not. Did the various communities on either side win? Not really. Who was the winner? You could argue it was the justice system.â€",1
"A Marine Buried This Box For 20 Years... Wife Finds It And Reveals THIS LifeA proud marine for over 25 years, earning 3 purple hearts and fighting in the Vietnam war, Major Donnie Dunageen was not one to show weakness. For over 2 decades, Dunageen kept a huge secret from his family, friends, and colleagues. Finally, his wife was able to dig up this secret he has kept close for so long. Major Donnie Dunageen was both the model and voice for Bambi. I never said a word to anybody about Bambi, the Marine said. If his circle of friends ever found out that he was Bambi, he would never live it down. If Disney does this to me, I can just see gunnery sergeants and captains writing home and saying, Dear Mom, guess who my [commanding officer] is? Dunageen told Military Times. Dunageen described his experience with the role: I spent months in front of the illustrators. Look left, look right, look afraid. When Bambi is kissed by a doe, he gives a look of disgust. We spent an hour on that look. Look like something bad has happened, theyd say. But I was having the time of my life. Finally someone said, Pretend like you just had castor oil. That did it. What a great man, and even greater twist to his life story. Please thank Major Donnie Dunageen for his service (and for the entertainment he provided to millions of children). Would you have kept this secret for so long? ",0
"This Is What It Feels Like To Have Your Life Savings Confiscated By The Global EliteMichael Snyder As you will see below, there are small businesses and aging retirees who have been absolutely devastated by the wealth confiscation that has taken place in Cyprus. Many businesses can no longer meet their payrolls or pay their bills because their funds have been frozen, and many retirees have seen retirement plans that they have been working toward for decades absolutely destroyed in a matter of days. Sometimes it can be hard to identify with events that are happening on the other side of the globe, but I want you to try to put yourself into their shoes for a few minutes. How would you feel if something like this happened to you? For example, just consider the case of one 65-year-old retiree that has had his life savings totally wiped out by the wealth tax in Cyprus. His very sad story was recently featured bythe Sydney Morning Herald Very bad, very, very bad, says 65-year-old John Demetriou, rubbing tears from his lined face with thick fingers. I lost all my money. John now lives in the picturesque fishing village of Liopetri on Cyprus south coast. But for 35 years he lived at Bondi Junction and worked days, nights and weekends in Sydney markets selling jewellery and imitation jewellery. He had left Cyprus in the early 1970s at the height of its war with Turkey, taking his wife and young children to safety in Australia. He built a life from nothing and, gradually, a substantial nest egg. He retired to Cyprus in 2007 with about $1 million, his life savings. He planned to spend it on his grandchildren some of whom live in Cyprus putting them through university and setting them up. There would be medical bills; he has a heart condition. The interest was paying for a comfortable retirement, and trips back to Australia. He also toyed with the idea of buying a boat. He wanted to leave any big purchases a few years, to be sure this was where he would spend his retirement. There was no hurry. But now it is all gone. If I made the decision to stay, I was going to build a house, John says. Unfortunately I didnt make the decision yet. I went to sleep Friday as a rich man. I woke up a poor man. You can read the rest of the article right here. How would you feel if you suddenly lost almost everything that you have been working for your entire life? And many small and mid-size businesses have been ruined by the bank account confiscation that has taken place in Cyprus. The following is a bank account statement that was originally posted on a Bitcoin forum that has gone absolutely viral all over the Internet. One medium size IT business has lost a staggering amount of money because of the bail-in that is happening in Cyprus Over 700k of expropriated money will be used to repay countrys debt. Probably we will get back about 20% of this amount in 6-7 years. Im not Russian oligarch, but just European medium size IT business. Thousands of other companies around Cyprus have the same situation. The business is definitely ruined, all Cypriot workers to be fired. We are moving to small Caribbean country where authorities have more respect to peoples assets. Also we are thinking about using Bitcoin to pay wages and for payments between our partners. Special thanks to: Jeroen Dijsselbloem Angela Merkel Manuel Barroso the rest of officials of European Commission With each passing day, things just continue to get worse for those with deposits of over 100,000 euros in Cyprus. A few hours ago, a Reuters story entitled Big depositors in Cyprus to lose far more than feared declared that the initial estimates of the losses by big depositors in Cyprus were much too low. And of course the truth is that those that have had their deposits frozen will be very fortunate to see any of that money ever again. But just a few weeks ago, the Central Bank of Cyprus was swearing that nothing like this could ever possibly happen. Just check out the following memo from the Central Bank of Cyprus dated 11 February 2013 that was recently posted on Zero Hedge You can believe our leaders when they swear that nothing like this will ever happen in the United States, in Canada or in other European nations if you want. But I dont believe them. In fact, as an outstanding article by Ellen Brown recently detailed, the concept of a bail-in for systemically important financial institutions has been in the works for a long time Confiscating the customer deposits in Cyprus banks, it seems, was not a one-off, desperate idea of a few Eurozone troika officials scrambling to salvage their balance sheets. A joint paper by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England dated December 10, 2012, shows that these plans have been long in the making; that they originated with the G20 Financial Stability Board in Basel, Switzerland (discussed earlier here); and that the result will be to deliver clear title to the banks of depositor funds. If you do not believe that what just happened in Cyprus could happen in the United States, you need to read the rest of her article. The following is an extended excerpt from that article ***** Although few depositors realize it, legally the bank owns the depositors funds as soon as they are put in the bank. Our money becomes the banks, and we become unsecured creditors holding IOUs or promises to pay. (See here and here.) But until now the bank has been obligated to pay the money back on demand in the form of cash. Under the FDIC-BOE plan, our IOUs will be converted into bank equity. The bank will get the money and we will get stock in the bank. With any luck we may be able to sell the stock to someone else, but when and at what price? Most people keep a deposit account so they can have ready cash to pay the bills. The 15-page FDIC-BOE document is called Resolving Globally Active, Systemically Important, Financial Institutions. It begins by explaining that the 2008 banking crisis has made it clear that some other way besides taxpayer bailouts is needed to maintain financial stability. Evidently anticipating that the next financial collapse will be on a grander scale than either the taxpayers or Congress is willing to underwrite, the authors state: An efficient path for returning the sound operations of the G-SIFI to the private sector would be provided by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company [meaning the depositors] into equity [or stock]. In the U.S., the new equity would become capital in one or more newly formed operating entities. In the U.K., the same approach could be used, or the equity could be used to recapitalize the failing financial company itselfthus, the highest layer of surviving bailed-in creditors would become the owners of the resolved firm. In either country, the new equity holders would take on the corresponding risk of being shareholders in a financial institution. No exception is indicated for insured deposits in the U.S., meaning those under $250,000, the deposits we thought were protected by FDIC insurance. This can hardly be an oversight, since it is the FDIC that is issuing the directive. The FDIC is an insurance company funded by premiums paid by private banks. The directive is called a resolution process, defined elsewhere as a plan that would be triggered in the event of the failure of an insurer . . . . The only mention of insured deposits is in connection with existing UK legislation, which the FDIC-BOE directive goes on to say is inadequate, implying that it needs to be modified or overridden. ***** You can find the rest of her excellent article right here. I would encourage everyone to especially pay attention to what she has to say about derivatives. Sadly, what is happening in Cyprus right now is just the continuation of a trend. In recent years, governments all over the world have turned to the confiscation of private wealth in order to solve their financial problems. The following examples are from a recent article posted on Deviant Investor October 2008 Argentinas leftist government, facing a gigantic revenue shortfall, proposes to nationalize all private pensions so as to meet national debt payments and avoid its second default in the decade. November 2010 Headline Hungary Gives Its Citizens an Ultimatum: Move Your Private Pension Fund Assets to the State or Permanently Lose Your Pension This is an effective nationalization of all pensions. November 2010 Ireland elects to appropriate ten billion euros from its National Pension Reserve Fund to help fund an eighty-five billion euro rescue package for its besieged banks. Ireland also moves to consider a regulatory move that compels some private Irish pension funds to hold more Irish government debt, thereby providing the state with a captive investor base but hugely raising the risk for savers. December 2010 France agrees to transfer twenty billion euros worth of assets belonging to its Fonds de Reserve pour les Retraites (FRR), the funded portion of its retirement system, to help pay off recurring social benefits costs. No pensioners are consulted. April 2012 Argentina announces that its Economy Ministry has taken an emergency loan from the national pension fund in the amount of $4.3 billion. No pensioners were consulted. June 2012 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unilaterally appropriates $45 billion from US federal pension funds to help tide over US deficits for the remainder of fiscal year 2011. January 2013 Treasury Secretary Geithner again announces that the government has begun borrowing from the federal employees pension fund to keep operating without passing the approaching fiscal cliff debt limit. The move effectively creates $156 billion in borrowing authority from federal pension funds. March 2013 Open Bank Resolution finance minister, Bill English, is proposing a Cyprus style solution for potential New Zealand bank failures. The reserve bank is in the final stages of establishing a rescue scheme which will put all bank depositors on the hook for bailing out their banks. Depositors will overnight have their savings shaved by the amount needed to keep distressed banks afloat. As I wrote about the other day, no bank account, no pension fund, no retirement account and no stock portfolio will be able to be considered 100% safe ever again. And once the global derivatives casino melts down, there are going to be a lot of major banks that are going to need to be bailed in. When that day arrives, they are going to try to come after your money. So dont leave your entire life savings sitting in a single bank especially not one of the banks that has a tremendous amount of exposure to derivatives. Hopefully we can get more people to wake up and realize what is happening. We are moving into a time of great financial instability, and what worked in the past is not going to work in the future. Time is running out. This article first appeared here at the Economic Collapse Blog.

"Denea Joseph has struggled to get out of bed each morning since Donald Trump won the White House. The 22-year-old college senior had hoped to get a job in communications or political consulting after graduation, but now she doesnâ€™t know whether sheâ€™ll be able to legally work in the US â€“ or even stay in the country.  Joseph, an undocumented immigrant who moved from Belize to California at age seven, has temporary deportation relief through Barack Obamaâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy â€“ but that protection could quickly disappear under a Trump administration.  â€œThe uncertainty is very daunting,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do.â€ Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California (UC), announced this week that she would be meeting with undocumented students like Joseph, and said the institution remained committed to supporting these students.    Denea Joseph. Photograph: Jenna Aya./UCLA   In the wake of her comments, students and professors across UC, one of the largest public college systems in the country, are now pushing administrators to take aggressive steps to protect thousands of undocumented students from potentially devastating policies, which could strip them of basic rights and lead to mass deportations. Some have urged UC to be a leader in what they hope will be an organized movement of American universities fighting back against Trump by forming â€œsanctuary campusesâ€ that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.   Related: Immigrants fear Trump deportations: â€˜This election changed my optimism'   â€œUniversity systems have a certain degree of autonomy to lead the way,â€ said Cinthia Flores, manager of the Dream Resource Center at the UC Los Angeles (UCLA) Labor Center. She added that they could â€œdemonstrate ally-ship to undocumented students and their familiesâ€. Whether UC will take a strong stance, however, remains unclear, particularly since Napolitano previously served as US secretary for homeland security under Obama, whose administration oversaw more deportations than any other in US history. While immigration advocates have long been disappointed by Obamaâ€™s deportations, the threat of Trump has them significantly more alarmed.  As with many policies, the specifics of the president-electâ€™s immigration plans remain undetermined, though on the campaign trail he relied on xenophobic and racially charged speeches, pledging to triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and launch a â€œspecial deportation task forceâ€. Trump is also expected to end Daca, which provides protections for 741,500 people.    Janet Napolitano Testifies At Senate Confirmation Hearing Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   Advocates said there were a number of tangible ways colleges could protect undocumented students, arguing that Californiaâ€™s public university system was in a good position to chart the course. California already has multiple progressive policies designed to support undocumented immigrants, including measures that help them access healthcare, driverâ€™s licenses and student loans. Across the state, UCâ€™s 10 campuses have resources tailored to undocumented people. The idea of sanctuary campuses is rooted in the existing concept of â€œsanctuary citiesâ€, local governments that donâ€™t cooperate with all federal immigration enforcement. Trump has repeatedly denounced such policies and threatened to cut federal funding from those municipalities. Madeleine Villanueva, an undocumented UC Berkeley student who moved from the Philippines at age nine, said a sanctuary policy would help put some students at ease. â€œNo one should be scared to go to class because someone can deport them,â€ said the 23-year-old political economy major. â€œI havenâ€™t been this scared to be in this country for awhile.â€    Madeleine Villanueva Photograph: Madeleine  Villanueva   MarÃ­a Blanco, executive director of UCâ€™s Undocumented Student Legal Services Center, said the university could consider a sanctuary system that blocks campus police departments from collaborating with ICE agents. The administration could also commit to shielding studentsâ€™ records from law enforcement. â€œThe university could in a unified way say â€¦ â€˜We will protect all our student information,â€™â€ said Blanco. â€œFor the students to know that and for the university to actually do that, that is a big protection.â€ Institutions like UC â€œare in fact a form of state governmentâ€, noted Hiroshi Motomura, a UCLA law professor and immigration expert, arguing that the university had the power to enact specific policies. It is unclear, however, if Trump could attempt to revoke federal funding â€“ for scholarships and research, for example â€“ if a university were to declare itself a sanctuary campus. Regardless, colleges have an ethical obligation to assist undocumented students against threats of deportation, Motomura said. â€œIt follows through on the educational mission. We want to see young people get an education, so weâ€™re troubled by anything that prevents that from happening.â€ Daca also allows eligible undocumented immigrants to legally work, and if Trump ends the program, Flores said, the university will have to find a way to ensure that students can continue to be employed on campus. â€œUndocumented students are some of the most financially challenged students on our campus,â€ added Lisa Garcia Bedolla, UC Berkeley professor of education and political science.   Related: What will President Donald Trump do? Predicting his policy agenda   In addition to standing up to Trumpâ€™s federal government, advocates said, UC needs to provide extensive legal services to threatened students as well as mental health counseling they may now require.  â€œAfter the election, itâ€™s like we all woke up in a nightmare,â€ said Gladis, an undocumented 26-year-old UC graduate student who requested to be identified only by her first name, given the uncertain future of Daca. â€œThe first thing that came to me is: how am I even going to continue in my program?â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s just been overwhelming.â€ Despite the threats, Joseph, a major in African American studies and public affairs at UCLA, said she was determined not to let Trumpâ€™s victory silence her. â€œAt a time like this where undocumented people are definitely under attack,â€ she said, â€œitâ€™s crucial that there are people still out there to speak up.â€ Villanueva, who is part of a student group called Rising Immigrant Scholars through Education, said undocumented immigrants would not stop protesting Trump. â€œWeâ€™re here. Weâ€™re willing to fight back.â€",1
"Willing to skip the test drive? Don't like car salesmen? General Motors has some cars it would like to show you. The government-rescued automaker announced on Monday that it is starting a trial in which consumers can buy new cars through eBay, the online sales site, allowing buyers to purchase Chevrolets, Buicks, GMCs or Pontiacs before they set foot in a dealership. The program will be initially limited to California, but the company hopes to extend it across the country. 'GM and our dealers are reinventing the car buying experience,' Mark LaNeve, GM vice president of U.S. sales said. The company is pitching the new online sales effort as a sign of renewed innovation at the automaker, which underwent a bankruptcy filing earlier this year and has been kept afloat with a $50 billion investment by U.S. taxpayers. Currently, eBay lists many cars for sale, but a large majority of those are used. This latest program makes more new GM vehicles available online. While past proposals to sell cars over the Internet have angered dealers who feared they would be left out -- the new program enlists GM dealers and connects them to consumers through the Web site. About 90 percent of California's 250 eligible GM dealers have signed on for the program, and collectively they will be listing about 20,000 cars. When the site, gm.ebay.com, begins operation Tuesday, consumers will have two methods of buying the cars. They can accept the 'buy it now' price -- that is, without haggling -- with those prices set lower than sticker. Or they can choose to make an offer and begin a negotiation. The site also allows consumers to compare prices across models and dealerships, determine the value of their trade-in, and whether they qualify for the federal 'Cash for Clunkers' program. A company spokesman said California was chosen as the trial site because GM would like to build its market share there. Currently, GM has a 13.5 percent market share in the state, far behind its national market share of 19 percent. 'Many people don't like to set foot in a dealership,' said GM spokesman John M. McDonald. 'This affords them opportunity to do all their shopping on line.' ",1

"SEATTLE â€”  The Boy Scouts of America, which voted last year to allow gay scouts but not openly gay scout leaders, has revoked the charter of a church-sponsored troop here for refusing to fire its adult gay scoutmaster.The decision, which one gay rights organization said was a first since the policy change last year, essentially bars the Rainier Beach United Methodist Church and its 15 scouts from using logos, uniforms or names associated with the Boy Scouts as long as the scoutmaster and Eagle Scout Geoffrey McGrath, 49, remains in charge.The churchâ€™s pastor, the Rev. Dr. Monica K. Corsaro, said Monday that Mr. McGrath was there to stay, and so was the youth group he leads, though perhaps without the familiar uniforms and the Scout oath.â€œWeâ€™re going to stand firm,â€ she said. â€œGeoffrey attends our church, and this is a way to support our youth in the neighborhood.â€This month, the Boy Scouts ordered the dismissal of Mr. McGrath, a software engineer who is married to his longtime partner, after he spoke about his sexual orientation in a news article profiling the troop, which was formed last year in a south Seattle neighborhood heavily populated by immigrants and lower-income families. The decision to disenfranchise the organization, sent in a letter on Friday, came after church officials said they would continue to support Mr. McGrath and had no intention of following the order.â€œBecause the church no longer agrees to the terms of the B.S.A.-chartered organization agreement, which includes following B.S.A. policies, it is no longer authorized to offer the scouting program,â€ a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, Deron Smith, said in an emailed statement on Monday. â€œWe are saddened by this development.â€The debate over whether to allow gays in scouting has been a grim one for the Boy Scouts, which has prided itself for generations on its assertions that scouting builds character and integrity, even as revelations in recent years about sexual predators in the ranks have exploded in court cases and news coverage. The scandals have made the organization sensitive about choosing leaders, many people involved in scouting said, especially as scout numbers have declined. Last yearâ€™s policy shift, to allow gay youths, sharply divided the religious community in particular.Mr. McGrath, who is on vacation in Italy, said in a telephone interview that discussions were already beginning about what might come next for the youth organization at Rainier Beach. However, Mr. Smith, the Boy Scouts spokesman, said in his statement, â€œWe have already identified a new chartered organization to sponsor the units and are contacting the parents and leaders of the units to inform them of the change.â€Mr. McGrath described his churchâ€™s youth group as diverse. He said there were boys from immigrant families, including from Asia and Africa, as well as two boys with gay fathers.â€œWeâ€™ll have to figure out a new name,â€ he said.",1
"Britainâ€™s retreat from empire is remembered in a popular iconography that contains only a little violence. Gandhi goes onÂ hunger strikes and performs acts of passive resistance; the Suez debacle calls time on our pretensions as a world power; Macmillan heralds the wind of change in Africa. All is done and dusted in the space of 15 years. For a postwar generation like mine, too young for national service and a troopship to the colonies, most of it happened inside the local Regal orÂ Odeon. Movietone footage would show Princess X or Prince Y standing on a podium to witness a ceremony of national independence, smiling at the native dancers as fireworks explode overhead. This book supplies a more troubling image: as the sun sets on the greatest empire the world has ever seen, long columns of smoke fill the tropical skies. In a thousand bonfires, Britain is burning the historical evidence.   Related: Uncovering the brutal truth about the British empire | Marc Parry   At first, the process was rather carefree. When Britain quit India in 1947, aÂ colonial official noted that â€œthe press greatly enjoyed themselves with the pall of smoke which hung over Delhi with the mass destruction of documentsâ€. By the time of Malayan independence in 1957, the authorities were learning discretion. British soldiers drove cratefuls of papers in a civilian truck from the colonyâ€™s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to what an administrator referred to as â€œthe Navyâ€™s splendid incineratorâ€ in Singapore. This 220â€‘mile journey to a secret burning exemplified the â€œconsiderable painsâ€ taken by the colony â€œto avoid exacerbating relationships between the British government and those Malayans who might not have been so understandingâ€. Four years later, in 1961, the colonial secretary Iain Macleod laid down some groundrules for British territories preparing for independence. No documents should be handed over to the successor regime that might embarrass Her Majestyâ€™s Government or its police, military and public servants; or that might compromise its sources of intelligence or be used â€œunethicallyâ€ by the countryâ€™s new government. Bonfires alone were too blunt a method of concealment. A newly liberated country might wonder why it inherited so few archives, while Britain might need to retain, for sentimental or other reasons, documents that in the wrong hands could damage its interests. The Colonial Office devised aÂ system known as â€œOperation Legacyâ€ that worked on the principle of parallel registries. Reliable civil servants, which in the governmentâ€™s eyes meant only those who were â€œBritish subjects of European descentâ€, were given charge of identifying and collecting all â€œsensitiveâ€ documents and passing them up the bureaucratic chain. This meant that when the moment of independence came, if not before, they could either be destroyed on site or removed (â€œmigratedâ€ became the official term) to the UK. As to the so-called â€œLegacyâ€ files that the colonyâ€™s new government would inherit, it was important that they gave an impression of completeness, either by creating false documents to replace those that had been weeded out or by making sure there was no reference to them inÂ the files that remained. This purging of the record happened across the world, in British Guiana, Aden, Malta, North Borneo, Belize, the West Indies, Kenya, Uganda â€“ wherever Britain ruled. In the words of Ian Cobain, it was a subversion of the Public Record Acts on an industrial scale, involving hundreds if not thousands of colonial officials, as well as MI5 and Special Branch officers and men and women from army, navy and air force. All of them, whether they knew it or not, were breaking a legal obligation to preserve important official papers for the historical record, in the expectation that most would eventually be declassified. The British government took extraordinary measures to make sure that the fate of these papers remained a secret, whether they had been â€œmigratedâ€ to the UK or destroyed abroad. According to official instruction, theÂ waste left by bonfires â€œshould be reduced to ash and the ashes broken upâ€. If burning was thought to be too difficult or unsuitable, then the sea offered an alternative. Officials in Kenya were told that documents could be â€œpacked in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free waters at maximum practicable distance from the coastâ€.    Governor general Lord Mountbatten salutes Indiaâ€™s National flag alongside his wife, Edwina, and prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Indiaâ€™s first Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi, 1947. Photograph: AP   Most of the files that survived â€“ theÂ concealed â€œmigrated archiveâ€ â€“Â found their way to Hanslope Park, aÂ country estate just off the M1 near Milton Keynes, where theÂ Foreign Office maintained an enormous cache of documents under the title â€œSpecial Collectionsâ€. By Cobainâ€™s reckoning, 15Â miles of floor-to-ceiling shelving was packed with files that dated from the 17th century to the cold war and the Troubles in Northern Ireland â€“ filesÂ so numerous that their catalogue entries measured the metres of shelf space they occupied. Officially, none ofÂ these documents existed. Some discreet research by the Foreign Office in 1979 showed that onlyÂ two (Kenya and Malta) of 37 former colonies were aware that their annals had been secreted in Britain or destroyed. The truth, so far as we now know it, emerged only because personal injury lawyers and the American historian Caroline Elkins pursued the evidence of a far crueller British response to Kenyaâ€™s Mau Mau insurgency than the available public records suggested. In 2011, the FO finally conceded that it had somehow â€œoverlookedâ€ its secret documentary hoard at Hanslope Park, where the Kenyan files alone took up 60 metres of shelving. Two years later more than 5,000 Kenyan claimants received Â£19.9m inÂ compensation and expressions of regret from the then foreign secretary William Hague. â€œWe believe there should be a debate about the past,â€ said an FO official. â€œIt is an enduring feature of our democracy that we are willing to learn from our history.â€ But that particular lesson had never been intended. Why were British governments so determined to obscure and bowdlerise their countryâ€™s colonial record? Some reasons are understandable: to spare individuals from embarrassment or prosecution; to help secure the loyalty of successor regimes during the commercial, military and political competition of the cold war. But Cobain goes further: Operation Legacy was intended to ensure that â€œthe British way of doing thingsâ€ would be remembered with â€œfondness and respectâ€ â€“ that the conduct of its imperial retreat would be seen as exemplary. To go to such lengths of deception for something as intangible and imponderable as a place in historyâ€™s good books may seem unlikely, but it was surely for these reasons, rather than any security concern, that, for example, British officialdom asked its servants to destroy or return to Britain any papers that â€œmight be interpreted as showing religious intolerance on the part of HMGâ€ as well as â€œall papers which might be interpreted as showing racial discrimination against Africans (or Negros [sic] in the USA)â€.   Operation Legacy was intended to ensure that the conduct of Britain's imperial retreat would be seen as exemplary   There is something else. We like secrets. Cobain recounts the history ofÂ British state secrecy from 1250, when the members of Englandâ€™s Privy Council first swore to keep their proceedings private. The oath has remained unchanged for the nearly 800 years since, while secrecy as a habit has grown via legislation (particularly the Official Secrets Act ofÂ 1911) and the confidentiality clauses contained in the humblest contract ofÂ employment. Cobain refers to it as â€œaÂ very British diseaseâ€, and while he makes no comparison with other modern democracies â€“ it would have been helpful to know, for example, how seriously the French state takes the duty of transparency â€“ his conclusion that government secrecy in Britain is not â€œjust an occasional necessity but the fiercely protected normâ€ is hard to refute. In the 1950s, the distinguished American sociologist Edward Shils decided that the explanation lay with aÂ ruling class that was â€œunequalled in secretiveness and taciturnityâ€, whose members were so close and comfortable with one another that they had little fear of hidden secrets. Cobain largely supports this view. Class deference combined with a relatively benign and trusting view of the stateâ€™s behaviour may explain â€œwhy the peculiarly uncommunicative nature of the British state does not provoke greater resentment and unease among the British public and mediaâ€. Edward Snowden is a case in point. When his disclosures about the UK andÂ US governmentsâ€™ practice of mass electronic surveillance were published (first in the Guardian) in 2013, the reaction in Britain was mild compared with the outrage expressed in many other countries. Inter-newspaper jealousies, the conservatism of the BBC, the rightwing nature of the British press: all these may have played a part in muting our concern. But it may also be that as a society we continue to believe in secrets and the people who make and guard them, despite everything Cobain reveals in this engrossing book. â€¢ The History Thieves by Ian Cobain is published by Granta.

"Army Ranger Vet Tells Kaepernick What He Should Be Doing Instead Of Sitting During National Anthem Quarterback Colin Kaepernick outraged football fans everywhere on Friday night, when he made the controversial decision to sit down during the Nation Anthem. During an interview later that evening, Kaepernick was asked about the message he was trying to send by staying seated. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, he commented. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernicks message was not received with open arms, and particularly upset an Army Ranger veteran (and minority) who served in Iraq. He released the following statement on the incident: I understand Kaepernicks intention; however I disagree with his means. His NBA counterparts protested the same ideas in a way that neither hurt the country, nor ignored the ideals that people of color have fought and died which; ideals represented by the symbolism of the American Flag and words of the National Anthem. As a member of a national organization, reaping the benefits of a country that apparently oppresses people who look like him, his argument is thin on a personal level. Doing what Dwayne Wade and company did at a game opener to support BLM, or making a public verbal statement as Carmelo Anthony did, or even a written statement as Michael Jordan did are all more appropriate acts of protest. He could write his congressman, he could petition, he could picket, he could join the service and actually fight for the rights he seems to think are not offered to him; his sitting through the National Anthem was a lazy lack of will and brain power. To refuse to stand for the National Anthem is his right as an American, and I support that right, however I do not agree with that action. There are a myriad of other ways to conduct social protest for people of color, that dont, whether by intent or otherwise, ignore the American principles that have given rise to extreme integration within a single American generation. My father was born without the right to vote and in one generation Ive been blessed to lead amongst the worlds greatest fighting force. To disrespect the country that has afforded him the opportunities and fortunes he acquired is only made more offensive by the fact that his life is the personification of the ideals I see in the American flag and National Anthem: a biracial child, raised by white parents, and who has accomplished much despite his oppression. In how many more nations around the world can a story like that come to fruition? He made valid points, Im not ignoring that there are still issues with race in America. However, he is ignoring the positive ideals of America that every colored person who has ever served, foughtwhile some diedfor, by refusing to stand. Proper action is exactly that, action, not the inaction of not standing because he couldnt think of a better way to protest. Kaepernick was wrong in his delivery and protested the wrong symbols of America. The American flag and National Anthem represent the highest of American ideals, not the lowest ideals. What do you think? Do you agree with this veteran completely? ",0
"A curious little cameo always plays out at the high court at the end of a day of evidence in the trial of a person accused of a serious sexual crime against women or young children. As the van carrying the accused sweeps out of the gates, a small crowd rushes forward, spitting venom at the alleged perpetrator. The police prevent the mob rushing the vehicle, but in a half-hearted fashion. After all, they seem to be saying, you can hardly blame these good, law-abiding and child-loving citizens for venting their fury at someone who has been accused of such heinous crimes. You always wonder, though, what else motivates some people to make their way to the courtroom and hang around before their quarry appears. Iâ€™ve been at trials like this and watched the crowd surge forward. In the main, the throng is made up of people from edgy neighbourhoods of the type that make civilised people hold their noses. The trial of someone accused of evil doings gives them the opportunity to say to politer society: â€œLook, you might think we are a thoroughly bad and disreputable lot, but at least weâ€™re not as bad as him.â€ They feel better about themselves for a little while because they realise that they are not quite so bad after all. Itâ€™s why sex offenders are targeted by other inmates. â€œYou might think weâ€™re hopeless criminals,â€ say the common thieves and murderers, â€œbut we are still a few notches higher on the food chain than these nonces.â€ They compete with each other to land a blow on these dregs of society, knowing that someone will call the Sun or the Star, which will report that the sex offender got his â€œjust desertsâ€. In the Commons on Thursday, another mob gathered and assembled stocks, in which they placed the virtual character of Sir Philip Green before spending three hours lobbing rotten food at him. Green was like the former boss of the Mirror group of newspapers, Robert Maxwell; he was an â€œasset-stripperâ€. He was â€œa billionaire spivâ€ who ought never to have received his knighthood. In fact, to many who sat on the green benches, he was worse than all these things: he had â€œshamed British capitalismâ€. The right honourable ladies and gentlemen were beside themselves with glee at being handed this rare opportunity to show the country that, whatever we might think of them, they are essentially decent coves. None of them would ever stoop to the levels of avarice that Greenp did, as he enriched himself at the expense of BHS and its 11,000 employees and their hard-earned pension funds. The Tories, though, have a higher category of opprobrium in which to bank all the disdain they have for Green. Itâ€™s the one that they use for the crime of â€œgetting caughtâ€. Green, you see, had become too greedy and had been caught and this had led to unwelcome scrutiny of capitalism and its nature. In normal circumstances, the Tories and their camp followers in the rightwing press can brand the enemies of capitalism as â€œsocialistsâ€ or â€œthe hard leftâ€, seeking to steal the hard-earned cash of successful people and break up their assets. Green, though, is one of them and so he would have to be sacrificed. Best to do it in public and let people know that as well as â€œbad capitalismâ€ there is a lot of â€œgood capitalismâ€ and that most people are â€œgood capitalistsâ€. Soon, everyone will forget it as quickly as they forgot about all those people and all those companies whose names appeared in the Panama Papers and whose money has paid for thousands of prizes at Tory fundraising dinners. These Tories at Westminster, ably supported by Labourâ€™s Blairites, are famed for giving capitalism a good name. What is it they say again when, regrettably, a company is taken over, its name changed, its historic debts unpaid, its workers sacked, its assets liquidated and the business renamed with fresh funding? â€œA little pruning now and then is cherished by the wisest men.â€ Why, the Royal Bank of Scotland avidly sought to fill its boots by going after small businesses and imposing impossible terms and conditions on loans and overdrafts in a practice known internally as â€œthe dash for cashâ€. This bank and its brother institutions in the UKâ€™s banking cartel, such as the Bank of Scotland, brought the nation to the brink of economic catastrophe. In the eight years since, not a single boss has faced criminal charges. Perhaps next month Theresa May could organise another one of these fun-filled parliamentary occasions when MPs get to pillory people and institutions. I would go further and have an annual X Factor and Great British Bake Off-themed event in which the public gets to strip a handful of prominent people and venerable businesses that have been caught with their long-johns down. We could call it The Purge. Using our telephones and smart devices, we could gather around the television and vote for all the other Philip Greens (the UK supports loads of them). First up would be the aforementioned RBS. I would propose taking away its right to use the title Royal. As we have a Bank of Scotland, that would be the end of RBSâ€¦ and good riddance. This institution has cost Britain much more trouble and money than Green. Then, of course, weâ€™d have Tony Blair. He doesnâ€™t have any UK honours but he has loads of massive properties. For his great act of folly in leading us into an illegal war, one of his properties should be confiscated every year until he finally decides to apologise for misleading the nation and making us a puppet state of George Bushâ€™s hillbilly administration. For the royal family, we could have a royal Itâ€™s A Knockout-themed show, in honour of Prince Edwardâ€™s dismal attempt at breaking into light entertainment in 1987. Here, we could get several of the most pointless royals, such as their Edward, Charles and Andrew, to fight it out across a series of obstacles to avoid being removed from the civil list. We could hold this every year until not a single one of this family, which has cost the country more than Sir Philip Green, took not another penny from the public purse.",1
"ROCHESTER, Vt. â€”  Tucked into valleys and isolated by mountains and rural expanse, many of Vermontâ€™s 273 school districts serve just a smattering of children. It is an old system, borne of the stateâ€™s agrarian history and knotty geography, and many Vermonters like it that way.Among those who do are many residents here in Rochester, a town of close to 1,100 in the center of the state. Its district has one school for about 150 pupils in kindergarten through 12th grade, some of whom come from nearby towns with even smaller districts. But some in Vermont see little future in the tiny districts, and a move is on for consolidation. It will not be easy.Vermont has more school districts than cities and towns, and a valued tradition of small-scale democracy. The last time there was a major overhaul in school governance was the late 1800s. But now there is an urgent fiscal reality: Vermontâ€™s public schools have lost more than 20,000 students since the second half of the â€™90s, making these districts even smaller, while education costs â€” and taxes to pay for them â€” have risen. â€œIf you designed a system from scratch, you would not design what Vermont has right now,â€ said Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. â€œWe currently have more superintendents and administration than any state of our size. We need to think of a better way.â€But while frustration increases â€” on Town Meeting day this year, 35 school budgets failed, which is about twice as many as usual â€” a House bill intended to streamline the education system by combining these tiny school districts has generated fierce opposition from parents, teachers and local administrators concerned it will erode that tradition of local control. And it comes with political difficulties, since many lawmakers voting for the bill would have to change the school board structures in their own towns.â€œThe fact of the matter is, in a state as small as Vermont, the schools are the heart of most communities and the notion of local control is close to a religion here,â€ said Shap Smith, the House Speaker, a Democrat who supports the bill.The measure, which passed the House last Wednesday after more than a month of wrangling, would give districts a few years to find ways to combine voluntarily. A state team monitoring the process would design a final plan for any remaining districts, ultimately forming 44 to 55 K-12 districts, many with at least 1,000 students. The new structure would go into effect in 2020, after approval by voters in the voluntarily aligned districts and legislators. How much money the measure would save is unclear, but proponents say it would create efficiencies and increase student opportunities by sharing resources and collaborating on programming, as well as reduce administrative costs.â€œWe think this is going to bend the curve of education costs,â€ said State Representative Johannah Donovan, a Democrat and chairwoman of the House Education Committee. Ms. Donovan also said the bill could help reduce staff and might help grow classes to more sustainable sizes.But even as small districts shrink further, many communities still view the proposal as a galling rebuke that ignores geographic realities, like mountains and rivers that might make travel to and from districts difficult.Rochester, like many Vermont towns, has felt the pressure of declining enrollment, having lost about 100 students over the last decade. A report by a consultant from the Vermont School Board Association that was completed last fall raised doubts about whether the district could continue to have a high school â€” which will see just 13 students graduate this year â€” if enrollment and costs continue on their divergent paths.When the floodwaters of Hurricane Irene wrecked the auditorium, the town rebuilt it. And earlier this year, residents voted in a nonbinding referendum to keep the high school open. The principal, Catherine Knight, is leading an effort to shore up the school with specialized programming and by playing up the strengths of its small size. â€œWe just see ourselves carry on a tradition,â€ said Ms. Knight. Referring to her students, she added, â€œThey may not have 50 courses to choose from, but they know who they are and who cares about them.â€Under the House consolidation plan, Rochester School would likely become part of a larger district, and would no longer be run by its current board, although the town could be represented on that larger districtâ€™s new board. Residents here are concerned that their school would wither away in a bigger district, possibly leaving their students no option but to be bused to schools on the other side of the nearest mountain.â€œSmaller schools like Rochester are going to be trampled on,â€ said Doug Gorton, a member of the school board here who works as a construction estimator. â€œThis valley really needs a K-12 school.â€Around the state, concerns about eroding village schooling have fueled opposition to the proposal. â€œI know how decent and how joyful a school run by local residents is compared to the anonymous monstrosities that the rest of the country has,â€ said Paul Keane, a former teacher and Hartford school board member.Proponents of the bill said that small schools were already closing, which was eroding local control anyway, and governance reform may be the only way to save them, by connecting them to resources from larger districts and heading off what some see as a looming budget crisis.â€œSmall schools can only survive if we change the governance structure,â€ said Dan French, the superintendent of the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, the terminology Vermont uses to refer to a cluster of districts overseen by one superintendent.State Senator Dick McCormack, a Democrat who leads the Education Committee, said last week that there was not enough time for his chamber to take up the House bill this session. â€œIn Vermont, we delegate a lot of that to the towns,â€ he said. â€œIf we were to reform something at this profound a level, we would really need serious consideration and the fact is that the clock has run out. Whatever was done this year will be a matrix for future work.â€Mr. McCormack said that the Senate would likely take up a bill early this week intended to create more savings in existing supervisory unions and encourage voluntary mergers.Governor Shumlin said he is hopeful lawmakers will pass something this session.As the debate continues, remote areas would likely continue to vex higher-level administrators interested in consolidation, distant as they are from bigger schools or administrative offices. That could be, in the end, what helps keep a school like Rochesterâ€™s from closing, regardless of administrative changes.â€œBecause itâ€™s so isolated,â€ said Ms. Knight, the principal, â€œI think people will really fight for it.â€",1
"An extraordinary war of words broke out between president-elect Donald Trump and the cast of the diversity-celebrating hit musical Hamilton, after the vice-president elect, Mike Pence, was booed by the audience. Trump took to Twitter to demand an apology from the cast after its members called on Pence and the incoming Trump administration to respect the rights of all Americans. â€œOur wonderful future VP Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theatre by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!â€, Trump tweeted.  The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016  The Indiana governor was booed by theatregoers after he arrived at the Richard Rodgers theatre in New York on Friday night to see the Pulitzer prize-winning musical. Then, after the curtain call, one of the actors, Brandon Victor Dixon, addressed Pence from the stage, with the cast behind him. â€œVice-president elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us, just a few more moments. Thereâ€™s nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen,â€ Dixon said. â€œWeâ€™re all here sharing a story about love. â€œWe, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.â€   Related: Trump demands apology from Hamilton cast after Mike Pence booed   Many of the remaining audience began to cheer softly as Dixon pointed towards Pence. â€œWe thank you for sharing this wonderful American story, told by a diverse group of men and women of different colours, creeds and orientations,â€ he said. But the president-elect took exception to the castâ€™s intervention. â€œThe theatre must always be a safe and special place,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œThe cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence.

Here's Pence getting booed as he gets to his seats at Hamilton pic.twitter.com/IRQG68x1sBâ€” David K (@dkipke12) November 19, 2016  Outside, many protesters jeered, including one woman who held up a sign with a line from the musical that always gets a cheer: â€œImmigrants: we get the job done.â€ It was not clear whether Pence heard the whole address or made any response. The incident brings into focus the conflicts and divisions that Donald Trumpâ€™s nascent presidency has already brought to Manhattan. His midtown home and transition HQ, Trump Tower, has been turned into a fortified citadel by the police and Secret Service, causing congestion and chaos in the area. Meanwhile, foreign leaders and diplomats are running a gauntlet of protesters to meet with the president-elect, and finding that they are taking meetings not with Trump and foreign policy advisers, but surrounded by family members. When the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited Trump in his gilded penthouse last week, he found himself seated across from Trumpâ€™s daughter, Ivanka, whose jewellery business last week sent out a marketing email pointing to the bracelet she wore during her fatherâ€™s interview on the current affairs show 60 Minutes. Hamilton is a hip-hop musical biography of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States, who rose to become the righthand man of George Washington, as well as a key figure in the creation of the US financial system and the coastguard. He was killed in an 1804 duel with the then vice-president Aaron Burr â€“ the character Dixon plays in the show. The musical, which has enjoyed a spectacular run on Broadway, was created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom it turned into a superstar. He had a long run in the lead part before relinquishing it earlier this year to Javier MuÃ±oz, his understudy. MuÃ±oz is openly gay and HIV-positive. He has made a point of speaking out about living with HIV since 2002 and his hopes to diminish the stigma around the condition.",1
"What was the first record you bought?  I think it must have been Mozart Violin Concertos with Anne-Sophie Mutter with Herbert von Karajan and the Berliner Philharmoniker. I remember staring at the cover of the LP, a photo of Anne Sophie at 16, so pretty and serious and committed next to the silver-haired Karajan with his Hollywood actor look (I always thought he looked a bit like James Dean!). Her playing was perfect for creating joy in a shy 11-year-old (who wanted to be like herâ€¦!).    What was the last piece of music you bought?  A score of the Concerti Grossi by Pietro Castrucci. Weâ€™re performing one of them in my Brecon Baroque Festival this year which as its theme has music played in London in the 17th and 18th centuries. He was a brilliant Italian violinist who studied with Corelli in Rome and who, like many other Italians, emigrating to London to play for his living. He is apparently the violinist depicted in the famous engraving by Hogarth of the Enraged Musician - what a brilliantly chaotic scene - practising with all that noise outside the window would drive anyone mad! Whatâ€™s your musical guilty pleasure? I do love singing - in fact when I was growing up, it was always thought that Iâ€™d be the singer and Julian my brother â€“ who is a singer â€“ the violinist. These days Iâ€™ll sing secretly in the car when driving on my own â€“ pieces I remember learning in my fatherâ€™s choir in Kassel, Germany, where I grew up as a teenager: Byrd masses, Ave Verum Corpus being a favourite, Beati by Stanford, Brittenâ€™s Te Deum, Allegriâ€™s Miserere (yes, I sang the top C back then!), Vaughan Williamsâ€™s Shakespeare Songs and lots of folk songs and arrangements, a favourite of those being Ca the yowes by Vaughan Williams. I remember one summer holiday as a teenager singing it on a mountainside in Scotland with Julian and three German friends from school, watching a sunset. Wow, thatâ€™s a long time ago, but that beautiful feeling of stillness and nostalgia in that setting and that folk tune has stayed with me.    If you had time to learn a new instrument, what would it be? The harp. Tim (my partner) bought me a beautiful Welsh smallish harp a few years ago, and I havenâ€™t had a minute to learn it properly, and thereâ€™s always something to learn on the violin... Did you ever consider a career outside of music? Doing what? Probably something else creative. Education perhaps as I love being around children. Music was in my life from the word go however, and I didnâ€™t really question whether I was going to â€œdo musicâ€, I just carried on from when I was a youngster.    What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? More communication with the audience. Firstly through playing of course. If youâ€™re not moved by what youâ€™re playing, the audience will not be moved either. But by talking as well. If and when I speak during a concert the vibe in the hall changes dramatically, especially if thereâ€™s a joke in there (a successful one that is!). I remember the first concert I dared do this I was much more nervous of saying anything than I was of playing, but itâ€™s got easier, it seems to somehow enhance the enjoyment of an audience if you communicate with words what the music means to you. If you had to pick one work to introduce someone to the wonders of classical music, what would it be? Probably Beethovenâ€™s Eroica Symphony â€“ it shocked and amazed listeners at the time and is strikingly colourful, beautiful and so engaging. But then thereâ€™s also Schubertâ€™s Unfinished, and thereâ€™s Bachâ€™s B minor Mass â€¦ but you did say â€œoneâ€ work.    Which conductor or performer of the past would you like to have worked with? Iâ€™d like to have played in Corelliâ€™s orchestra. Apparently he was strict and inspiring at the same time and his particular passion was how to produce a beautiful sound on the violin. Apparently when you auditioned for his orchestra in Rome you had to play and hold a long note to a count of 10 without wavering your sound quality or dynamic! Whatâ€™s the most unusual place/venue youâ€™ve performed?   Hearing Viktoria Mullova play the Sibelius Violin Concerto completely stunned me and widened my horizons hugely.   I remember playing Bachâ€™s Matthew Passion in a cave on Lanzarotte with Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert which was surreal. But actually thinking of the Matthew Passion, the strangest mixed up emotional feeling I ever had was performing it on an Easter Sunday in Jerusalem with Paul McCreesh and the Gabrieli Players. Whatâ€™s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? Standing towards the front of the Arena at the Royal Albert Hall (after queueing all day of course) listening to Viktoria Mullova play the Sibelius Violin Concerto. She had such utter control over what she was doing, a beautiful, steely and penetrating sound and the best characterisation of that piece Iâ€™d ever heard. It completely stunned me and widened my horizons hugely. Weâ€™re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why?  Back to Bach! I would love to have sat next to him (unobtrusively of course) on his organ bench in the Thomas Kirche in Leipzig when he improvised. That really would be heaven.    Which non-classical musician would you like to work with? Keith Jarrett â€“ with his mind glowingly brilliant, moving and free improvising ability. Whatâ€™s the most overrated classical work? - ie is there a warhorse whose appeal you really donâ€™t relate to? That Rodrigo guitar concerto. I love the sound of the guitar (not least since my mother used to sing me to sleep playing and singing with her guitar), but somehow the intense taking-yourself-too-seriously thing which that piece seems to encourage is not what I feel music and performing it is about.

"MH17: World See Tragedy, US Sees Game ChangerTony Cartalucci Power asserted that the most likely culprits behind the downing of MH17 were eastern Ukrainian separatists. Because of the high altitude MH17 was traveling at approximately 33,000 feet Power conceded that the weapons separatists have been using to down Ukrainian military aircraft would have been inadequate to down MH17. After claiming separatists had bragged about downing the airliner based on information from social media, she explained that Russia most likely assisted the separatists in operating the sophisticated anti-air missile systems required to reach MH17s altitude. Power gives no explanation as to why after multiple successful downings of Ukrainian military aircraft with man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), Russia and the separatists decided to employ larger, more complex weapon systems that would link any incident directly back to Moscow. Power also failed to explain how in one breath she suggests the separatists shot down MH17, then in the next claimed they did not have the ability to do so, and that Russia instead assisted. Power appears to be suggesting Russia rolled self-propelled anti-air missile systems into Ukrainian territory and assisted separatists in firing at MH17 specifically since all other incidents of separatists shooting down aircraft involved man-portable systems incapable of hitting MH17. Janes Defense Weeklys articles, Two Ukrainian Mi-24s shot down by MANPADS, Ukrainian Mi-8 shot down near Slavyansk, and Polish Grom MANPADS appear in east Ukraine conflict, illustrate the scale of proliferation in both numbers and varieties of man-portable anti-air systems that have ended up in separatist hands. Power and other Western sources have claimed higher flying military transports being shot down by separatists indicate that indeed they have begun deploying with Russias help sophisticated self-propelled missile systems. If separatists did use a Buk (SA-11) self-propelled surface-to-air missile system to down MH17, it would have been the first attempt made with the sophisticated weapon, against the highest flying aircraft targeted thus far in the conflict, and done so at incredible risk when man-portable systems had already proven such a success. In other words it is a scenario that is very unlikely and a scenario Samantha Power and the special interests she represents have failed to underpin with evidence. Strategically, politically, and even tactically, Russia and the separatists gained nothing by employing the larger Buk systems within Ukrainian territory as Power is suggesting. Where the World Sees Tragedy, NATO Sees a Game Changing Opportunity Powers comments and conclusions were echoes from the halls of the Wests corporate-financier funded policy think-tanks. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in a statement titled, The Downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17: Russia in the Dock, provides a self-incriminating indictment as to the motives Kiev and its NATO backers had in carrying out the attack on MH17 and subsequently framing Russia for it. RUSIs statement claims: RUSI explains in great detail the possible motivation Kiev and NATO had to shoot down MH17 and subsequently frame Russia. An international flight, with passengers from across the globe would invoke unifying outrage against Russia as well as universal support for NATOs so far unsuccessful attempts to isolate Moscow. RUSI itself admits that individual members of the EU have until now, been reluctant to back sanctions and further confrontation with Moscow. NATOs Atlantic Council claimed in a statement titled, In the Ukraine War, Putins Veil of Deniability Has Vanished, claims: NATO needed a game changer, because it was playing a game it was clearly losing. The dubious circumstances surrounding the downing of MH17 occurring just as Kievs forces were deteriorating across the country and additional US sanctions against Russia fell flat is more than a mere coincidence. RUSI and the Atlantic Councils statement represent an increasingly desperate and shrinking corner the West finds itself in. With the ascension of Russia along with other BRICS nations, a game changer was desperately needed to stain Russias relations with the world for years to come, and help arrest what appeared to be the irreversible rise of the global East and South, in tandem with the irreversible decline of the West. If the West was so sure of who was responsible for the downing of MH17, it would patiently allow the facts to reveal themselves, giving them unassailable credibility as they begin an effective campaign to contain, isolate, and dismantle Russias global influence. However, just like in Damascus, Syria in August 2013 when NATO gassed thousands of Syrians in what is now confirmed to be a false flag attack, the West is racing against the clock to do maximum damage before the truth of MH17 emerges. The very expediency the West pursues its smear campaign against Russia with raises suspicion. The world has been at critical junctures like this before, with Western politicians and media personalities making well-scripted, passionate pleas but based on little to no evidence. Weathering the psychological inertia the West is seeking to stampede its political assault on Russia through with, will cause the Wests attempts to reverse its fortunes in Ukraine to fail. Failing in Ukraine will weaken the Wests position in Syria and Iraq, further undermine its pivot in Asia, and diminish its ability to visit upon humanity yet another horrific staged event it may finally realize will only further compromise its place among a new emerging, multipolar global order not help it restore its antiquated unipolar empire.

"REPORT: Russian Mind Control RevealedAndrew V Pontbriand The cold war was seen mostly as a space race, and a nuclear standoff between the worlds superpowers, but was there more behind it? According to a new report out by Serge Kernbach, from the Research Centre of Advanced Robotics and Environmental Science in Stuttgart, Germany, he detailed just under 100 years of Soviet studies and experiments on mind control, costing over $1 billion dollars. This unconventional research is similar to what was being done here in the U.S. and also what the Nazis did. However, much of the information on the Soviet mind control program is still largely classified. The paper outlines how the Soviets developed cerpan, a device to generate and store high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, and the use of this energy to affect other objects. Much like what was done with the MK Ultra program in the United States, the Soviet program used people who were drugged up on LSD, or were being tested without even knowing it. It is also plausible to assume (since one of the agencies involved was the NKVD, the precursor to the KGB) that some of the testing was even done to attempt to successfully acquire a Manchurian candidate, as at the time this was seen as the best assassination weapon you could have. Due to the investigations into abuse by the CIA, more is actually known about MK Ultra, and secret weaponry than is known about the Russian mind control programs, as some experiments that took place over 80 years ago are still classified. The newly declassified information outlined in thereport, however, only touches on the Soviet psychotronics program and the bizarre experiments undertaken. With so much information still classified, will we ever know the whole truth?

"The Shape-Shifting Sheik and the Sydney SiegeTony Cartalucci Another embarrassing chapter has unfolded for Western intelligence and security communities in the wake of the so-called Sydney Siege. The suspect named by the media as Man Haron Monis also has gone by the names Manteghi Boroujerdi and Mohammad Hassan Manteghi and was an individual now confirmed to have long been on the radar of the Australian government, media, law enforcement, and court system since his arrival on Australian shores almost two decades ago. Claiming he was a lone wolf attacker whose violence and extremism could not have been foreseen is betrayed by an extensive criminal record including murder, preceded by the suspicious circumstances that brought him to Australia to begin with. Two-Decades in the Spotlight He fled Iran in 1996 for unknown reasons, claiming in a 2001 Australian ABC interview that he was formerly of Irans Ministry of Intelligence and Security. He claimed in the same interview to have been in contact with the UN about secret information he had regarding the Iranian government. The 2001 interview titled, New Cardinals for Rome, George Bush, Muslims in Australia, as part of ABCs Religion Report, quoted Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi as claiming: In Iran, mostly I have been involved with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security. And that: the Iranian regime wants to make me silent, because I have some secret information about government, and about their terrorist operations in the war. I sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and somebody on behalf of Mr Kofi Anan sent the answer, and they want to do something. He would also profess his love for the West, and in particular his belief that the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia in particular were religious societies claiming: If we explain about the meaning of the word Islamic as a religious society, if we say Islamic society is a religious society, and a society which has a relation with God, and wants to be honest, we can say Australia, Canada, England, USA, so many western countries, they are religious societies. They dont say We are religious, but in fact the spirit of religion, we can see the spirit of religion in these societies. And some other countries in the Middle East, in Asia, they say We are Islamic they have a name of Islamic, but in fact they are not religious societies and religious governments. Whenever I walk in the street, whenever I go out in Australia, I feel I am in a real religious society. I dont want to say it is perfect, we dont have a perfect society on the earth, but when we compare, if we compare Australia with Iran and other countries in the Middle East, we can say it is heaven. ABC itself introduced Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi as follows: People in Sydney walking past the State Parliament buildings on Macquarie Street in recent weeks might have noticed a tall Muslim cleric who has taken up residence in a tent on the footpath outside. He is Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi, a liberal cleric who fled Iran four years ago after being very critical of the Iranian regime. Ayatollah Boroujerdis wife and two daughters are now under house arrest in Iran, and hes hoping the Howard government will put pressure on the regime there to let his family join him here in Australia. Far from an extremist Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi instead posed as the perfect poster child for the ongoing anti-Iran, pro-war propaganda building at the time propaganda that continues to this very day and is an integral part of current efforts to overthrow both the Syrian and Iranian governments. He was a liberal Iranian fleeing the Iranian regime who held his family hostage. He professed his admiration of Western society and praised it as heaven. Heavenly could have also described his propaganda value to the West at the time. The Shape-Shifting Sheik Over the years, however,Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi would shape-shift, coincidentally along the same unsavory lines Western pro-war rhetoric shifted first by helping discredit anti-war sentiment in Australia by sending abusive letters to the families of fallen soldiers, then discrediting Islam itself through cartoonish acts of rhetorical extremism. And just like a shape-shifter, the character Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi would don many different costumes. At times he would appear as a secular liberal dressed in Western, if not outdated attire, at other times a Shaia cleric wearing traditional robes. Most recently, to help sow ISIS hysteria, he impersonated an ISIS supporter, claiming to have converted to Sunni Islam a month ago, wearing Wahabi-inspired terrorist attire. And in his final act amid the Sydney Siege, he would produce the flag often carried by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra in Syria a terrorist front that has in fact drawn many Australians from Sydney over the course of the recent Syrian war. His alleged ideological causes were as contradictory as his attire. First claiming for years to be a pro-Western liberal Shiaa, dressed as a Shiaa cleric, his recent shift to supporting ISIS terrorists would mean he was backing a terrorist front of Wahabists enemies of Iran and the Shaia communities across the entire Muslim World that depend on Tehran for protection. It would also mean he was adopting an ideology that at least rhetorically claims to stand in complete opposition to the West he had previously claimed to admire. While Australian authorities seemed perfectly comfortable with Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghis continuously disruptive behavior, genuine leaders across Australias Muslim community implored the Australian government to investigate him. In a 2008 Australian article titled, Call to probe mystery Shia cleric, it was reported that: FEDERAL agents have been urged by the nations senior Shia leader, Kamal Mousselmani, to investigate an Iranian man purporting to be a prominent Islamic cleric. Sheik Mousselmani told The Australian yesterday the mystery cleric who has been identified as Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi on his website after appearing under the name Sheik Haron was not a genuine Shia spiritual leader. He said there were no ayatollahs supreme Shia scholars in Australia and none of his fellow spiritual leaders knew who Ayatollah Boroujerdi or Sheik Haron was. We dont know him and we have got nothing to do with him, Sheik Mousselmani said. The federal police should investigate who he is. It should be their responsibility. What could have possibly motivated the Australian government to continue giving a clear and persistent menace to society free rein? The Current Narrative Doesnt Add Up It could be argued that Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi was mentally unstable, and the New York Times in an article titled, Gunman in Sydney Had Long History of Run-Ins With the Law, would even claim Iran itself warned of his mental instability stating: The state-run Iranian news agency, Fars, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Marziyeh Afkham, as saying that it had warned the Australian authorities about Mr. Monis. The history and mental-psychological conditions of this individual, who sought political asylum in Australia more than two decades ago, had been discussed with Australian authorities many times, Ms. Afkham was quoted as saying. However, were that the case, and had Iran warned Australian authorities of this man, one wonders why he would be allowed political asylum in the first place, let alone allowed to occupy the spotlight amid Australias divisive political landscape for so long, especially in light of his many alleged criminal offenses. Considering the global surveillance state Australia finds itself a willing partner in, how is it possible to claim Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi was a lone wolf terrorist? Surely if Australians are being surveilled without probable cause, so too was Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi, and yet he was apparently able to obtain weapons, travel freely with them, all while publicly supporting terrorist organizations including ISIS. Vox Media would report in its article, Sydney hostage taker Man Haron Monis pledged allegiance to ISIS on his website, that: According to a portion of his now-deleted website (which you can see here) Monis pledged allegiance to ISIS before the attack. Vox would go on to cite Washington-based Neo-Conservative pro-war, anti-Iranian think-tank, theFoundation for the Defense of Democracy (FDD) to claim Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi had no ties to ISIS and that he was simply a fruitcake. No evidence was provided. However, this fruitcake was credible enough to be granted political asylum by the Australian government in 1996, credible enough to serve the Wests propaganda campaign against Iran in 2001, and then play along with the Wests coordinated strategy of tension designed to discredit anti-war sentiment during Australias participation in the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, and more recently ratchet up anti-Islamic sentiment and help justify continued Western military intervention in nations like Syria and Iran against which both Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghi and the FDD are/were clearly opposed to. In fact, if unable to convince Australians to back liberals like himself in opposition to the Iranian government, perhaps he and his handlers felt posing as an extremist to provoke support for direct military intervention in Syria and in turn, Iran, was the next best bet. One thing is for sure, for a man in Australias political and legal spotlight either for good or for bad for nearly two decades, it is highly unlikely he was able to put together this plot without Australian security and intelligence agents knowing. After several recent anti-terror operations carried out across Sydney based on intercepted communication, why hadnt federal agents also visited a suspected murderer openly pledging allegiance to ISIS? The Western medias eagerness to dismiss Boroujerdi/Monis/Manteghis actions amid the Sydney Siege before a full investigation reeks of a cover-up and whatever the truth may be what is being insisted upon by the media, government, and corporate-funded think-tanks now certainly isnt it. Tony Cartaluccis articles have appeared on many alternative media websites, including his own at ",0
"Prepare For Whats Coming: The Largest Financial Collapse This Planet Has Ever SeenMac Slavo Every promise made by the President and Congressional democrats who supported Obamacare legislation has turned out to be a complete falsehood. But whats critical to our future well-being is that we understand that the machinations and conjecture are not restricted solely to the health care debacle. They pervade every aspect of government on the federal, state and local level alike. We have been lied to on every front, as evidenced by revelations just yesterday that the Bureau of Labor and Statistics completely fabricated unemployment numbers in an effort to sway the 2012 election results. This is supposed to be an impartial, non-partisan agency whose sole purpose is to calculate numbers, and even that has been hijacked by agenda-driven politicians and special interests. Whether were talking about health care, the economy, personal privacy, or national security, we must assume, unless proven otherwise, that we are being lied to. The lies continue, non-stop. Govern by crisis, offer a lie for a solution, and continue to indebt this country. Why? Because it isnt about serving We the People. It is about serving financial special interests, plain and simple. Youd better realize that and you better prepare for whats coming, because inevitably, when this Ponzi scheme of stealing from our future in order to pay for fraudulence now comes to an end it is going to lead to the largest financial collapse this planet has ever seen and most people are going to be absolutely blindsided by it. As Charlie notes, no matter how deep one attempts to bury their head in the sand, youd better prepare for whats coming because the collapse of our entire way of life is, at this point, inevitable. Or, you can go on pretending its not happening, that government officials care about you, that youre going to have platinum health care coverage next year, and that tens of millions of people in America are not actually living in a modern day depression.

"To the Editor:â€œEmbrace of Renewables Has a Hidden Cost,â€  by Eduardo Porter (Economic Scene column, July 20), perpetuates the myth that nuclear and renewable energy are competitors. In reality, cheap natural gas is causing nuclearâ€™s woes because fossil fuel power plants set prices in electricity markets, not wind or nuclear.Cheap fossil fuels have a 500 times larger effect than wind on setting the prices received by nuclear plants, according to the countryâ€™s largest electricity market monitor. Mr. Porter does note: â€œThe economics of nuclear energy are mostly to blame. It just cannot compete with cheap natural gas.â€ But he still blames renewables.As the lowest cost and most scalable zero-emission resource, wind energy must play a central role in decarbonization. Wind accounted for 77 percent of United States growth in zero-carbon electricity over the last decade, while Europe has slashed emissions using renewables.The main challenges facing both renewables and nuclear are that carbon pollution is unregulated and that we need a stronger grid to deliver our low-cost energy to consumers.We hope that nuclear proponents will work with us to solve the real problems holding back all low-carbon energy, rather than waging internecine warfare.MICHAEL GOGGINSenior Director of ResearchAmerican Wind Energy AssociationWashingtonTo the Editor:Eduardo Porter exaggerates the challenge of integrating renewables into the electricity grid by taking a narrow view of tools we have to support these clean energy resources.Much of the world can make larger investments in renewables with negligible changes to the grid. For places ahead of the curve, like California and Germany, it will be important to use carbon-free technologies that make grid operations more dynamic.For example, energy storage and load-shifting programs are flexible, and unlike fossil fuels, they donâ€™t emit pollution that causes climate change.Nuclear can be an important source of carbon-free electricity, but in places where costs to build renewables are less than costs to operate a nuclear plant safely, it may not make sense to keep the nuclear online.In some cases, nuclear plant generation can make the grid less flexible and more difficult to integrate renewables. But these are known challenges that can be solved.We would do better to focus on reducing fossil fuel pollution instead of pitting nuclear against renewables.LAURA WISLANDSenior Energy AnalystUnion of Concerned ScientistsOakland, Calif.To the Editor:We can blame subsidies for the difficulties cited in the column.Remove all subsidies, put a price on carbon emissions that reflects the full environmental cost of burning fossil fuels, and let the market sort things out. Perhaps there will be a nuclear renaissance. Perhaps there will be a surge in new and cheaper storage technology, and renewables will realize their full potential.Perhaps weâ€™ll start sequestering carbon dioxide from natural gas, a process whose useful product is hydrogen. Or maybe all of the above. A carbon fee is gaining support from both conservatives and liberals for whom saving the earth is more important than preserving their ideological purity.JOHN ANDREWSMontauk, N.Y.The writer, a retired engineer, did research on energy-efficient buildings at Brookhaven National Laboratory for more than 25 years.To the Editor:Eduardo Porter does a good job of itemizing the growing pains of wind and solar, but he doesnâ€™t put these problems in context.Yes, Germany grew its renewable market aggressively and has been forced to rely on coal as a backup, but that was only after Fukushima persuaded the Germans to shut all of their nuclear plants without any prior planning. Neither does Germany have anything close to our potential for renewable power because of its geographical constraints.Similarly, Mr. Porter cites the oversupply of solar power in California during daylight hours, but he does so without discussing the true nature of the problems involved or their solutions beyond creating fear of making any change at all.What critics of change donâ€™t want to address is how haphazardly we are going about this necessary national transition to renewable energy. It should surprise no one that absent a coherent federal plan to build our energy infrastructure of the future, we are going to create problems for ourselves that need never have happened.PAUL CROUSERChatham, Ill.",1
"Prisoners Across U.S. Organizing For Nationwide StrikeBy Derrick Broze On September 9, prisoners across the United States will participate in coordinated work stoppage and hunger strikes in an attempt towhat they view asprison slavery. The nationwide action is the result of years of frustration and organizing by prisoners and their support networks outside of the prison bars. To every prisoner in every state and federal institution across this land, we call on you to stop being a slave, to let the crops rot in the plantation fields, to go on strike and cease reproducing the institutions of your confinement. This is a call for a nationwide prisoner work stoppage to end prison slavery, starting on Sept. 9, 2016. They cannot run these facilities without us. The event is being planned by a number of groups, including The Ordinary People Society (TOPS), Free Alabama Movement(FAM), Free Virginia Movement, Free Ohio Movement, Free Mississippi Movement, New Underground Railroad Movement (CA), Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People, and Families Movement (FICPFM), and Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee. TheFICPFM has also scheduled a national conferencefor September 9 when the strikes begin. Our protest against prison slavery is a protest against the school to prison pipeline, a protest against police terror, a protest against post-release controls, reads a statement announcing the strikes.Prison impacts everyone, when we stand up and refuse on Sept. 9, 2016, we need to know our friends, families and allies on the outside will have our backs. This spring and summer will be seasons of organizing, of spreading the word, building the networks of solidarity and showing that were serious and what were capable of. In preparation for the strike, prisoner solidarity activists in Columbus, Ohio are organizing the Bend the Bars 2016 Midwest convergence in support of prisoners struggles. The convergence will take place from August 26 to 29 and feature workshops, and discussions on prisoners resistance and the September 9 strike. The organizers say they are hoping to assemble a diverse group of individuals, groups, and organizations that are united by a desire to work against prisons, in support of our friends and family members who are locked up, and prisoners who are organizing themselves and acting up on the inside. Ohio itself has been a hotbed forprisoner resistance activity. In 1993 prisoners organized to shut down theSouthern Ohio Correctional Facility for eleven days. That strike was organized without outside help and without the organizing power of the Internet. Ohio residents and activists have plenty of reason to oppose the prison industrial complex, as a new report from theU.S. Department of Education revealed that Ohio has spent more money on correction facilities than education over the last 30 years. The budget for corrections grew by a whopping 237 percent, while public education funds grew just 71 percent. The September 9 nationwide strike will also mark45th anniversary of the notoriousAttica prison uprising. On September 9, 1971, around1,000 of Attica prisons 2,200 inmates organized a riot that lasted five days and claimed the lives of 33 prisoners and 10 prison guards. During that time the prisoners took 42 guards hostage andreleased theThe Attica Liberation Faction Manifesto Of Demands. The manifesto contained 27 demands, including better medical treatment, fair visitation rights, an end to physical brutality, better sanitation, and improved food quality. In the 45 years since the Attica riot, the American prison population has exploded to never before seen levels of incarceration. As The Influence notes, the massive growth in prison population is largely due to the failed War on Drugs. Three months before the Attica Uprising, President Richard Nixonhad declaredhisWar on Drugs.The combined US state and federal prison population then hovered below 200,000 people.Through the Reagan and Clinton yearswhich ramped up the drug war and introduced mandatory minimum sentencinguntil today, that number ballooned to over 1.5 million. In total,over 2.2 million people now behind barsin jail, prison,immigration detention, oryouth detentionon any given day. According to Federal Bureau of Prisons data, nearly half (84,746,46.3%) of all federal inmates are incarcerated for drug offenses. That is nearly 85,000 human beings in prison for victimless crimes (selling or using illicit drugs). But what about the other prisoners? Should we limit our outrage to only those prisoners who are non-violent? At the end of the day these prisoners are human beings who are forced to endure inhumane treatment and abuse. Many of the prisoners in Americas prisons found themselves there because of the Drug War and ridiculous schemes like Reverse Drug Stings. There is also the issue of forcing prisoners to work for extremely low pay, creating products or growing food that is then shipped to corporations and resold for a large profit to unwitting Americans. (See this for a list of companies who reportedly use prison labor.) Slavery in America does indeed still exist. It exists in the minds of those who believe the State will provide for them and it exists in the prisons where men and women are forced to work. If you care about this issue please share this article and do what you can to support the nationwide strike. Derrick Broze is an investigative journalist and liberty activist.

Dont put thoughts in the idiots head. As a retired Corrections Officer I recommend locking the prisons down on Sept. 8th and feeding sack lunches to all the inmates for a week, which will buy the staff time to get their act together for whats really coming..

"The award-winning team behind Netflixâ€™s new royal drama The Crown has already â€œmapped outâ€ the next two seasons of the biopic, with the action running up to the end of the 1980s and the marriage of Diana to Prince Charles. The first season deals with the relationship between Princess Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend in the 1950s as well as the Queenâ€™s accession to the throne. In an interview with the Guardian, Andy Harries, the co-founder of Left Bank Pictures, said: â€œThere are so many things in [the next series] â€“ Thatcher, Blair, Diana. But Iâ€™m sure Netflix will want to wait and see how this one goes first.â€ Three lawyers worked on the current series, which launches on 4 November, because its writer, Peter Morgan, and the Left Bank production team were keen to avoid legal threats from those depicted who are still alive.   Related: Netflix's glittering Crown could leave BBC looking a little dull   The fact that the series is launching on the US-based streaming service has highlighted the expansion of global entertainment groups into the UK. â€œThis is a very, very British project with very experienced British talent and then we working for a global media company,â€ said Harries, who received an Academy Award nomination as producer of The Queen, also with Morgan. Harries, Morgan and director Stephen Daldry went to the US believing they would probably end up with a global partner for the BBC in the UK. Netflix, however, had already â€œmapped out their global rolloutâ€ internally and offered Â£100m for the two series within 40 minutes.  â€œI came out of the room, I felt like Iâ€™d been in Tutankhamunâ€™s tomb or something,â€ said Harries. â€œThey said: â€˜Yes, we will pay for it, we will support you, you can do what you want and by the way it will be launching in 190 countries at the same time.â€™ Itâ€™s staggering! Itâ€™s just a different world and this is where the world is going.â€ Netflix was looking for content that would help it grow not just in the UK but globally and which might attract older subscribers. The UK marketing plan involves special screenings for the Womenâ€™s Institute.  Harries admits that his mother might have to become a Netflix subscriber to watch the show.",1
"Doha, Qatar â€” If you believe many of the commentators and policy makers in Washington, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is an expansionist on the march. Heâ€™s had one great success after another: First, he annexed Crimea and fueled a destabilizing conflict in eastern Ukraine. Then he intervened in the Syrian civil war and rescued his client, the government of Bashar al-Assad, in its moment of need. Last month, Ashton B. Carter, the secretary of defense, indicated that he believed that Russia is the worldâ€™s greatest threat to American national security, ahead of a nuclear-armed North Korea and the jihadists of the Islamic State.This alarmism is counterproductive and largely wrong.Three weeks into a partial truce, Russia has begun withdrawing most of its forces from Syria after Mr. Putin claimed that the militaryâ€™s goals there had been achieved. In Ukraine, a cease-fire has been in place for over six months with few changes to the countryâ€™s situation. These realities underline the truth: Russiaâ€™s objectives are limited. The United States should recognize and accept this, and â€” while it may be hard for some in Washington to imagine â€” work with Moscow when interests overlap.In Syria, Russia has had two linked aims: making sure that the Syrian regime survives in some form and ensuring that Russia will play a key part in whatever peace process eventually brings an end to the civil war. Washington has now been forced to accept these Russian positions.Despite Russian air support, there was never a chance that the Assad regime would retake most of Syria from the rebels. It seems that Russia never intended for this, either. To help put the government in Damascus back in control of Idlib and Deraa, for example, Russia would have had to commit a huge, costly and dangerous infusion of forces over several years and risk provoking an even larger regional conflict. Instead, it seems Moscow just wanted to ensure that its ally in Damascus was not defeated by the rebels, many of whom are radical jihadists. The partial Russian military withdrawal at a time when the war has entered a tenuous cease-fire demonstrates the limits of Russiaâ€™s aims and Mr. Putinâ€™s desire to work with â€” not against â€” the United States to achieve a settlement.Russiaâ€™s military intervention in Syria has drawn criticism from international observers since many of its airstrikes seemed to target anti-Assad rebels rather than the Islamic State itself. But Seymour Hersh has reported, and my own sources have confirmed, that some figures in the Western military and intelligence communities see Russiaâ€™s strategy of fighting jihadism in Syria and keeping parts of the Assad government in power as the best course of action for now. These people are not serving Russian interests, but they have recognized that destroying the existing Syrian state could lead to handing the country over to terrorists.But if there is tacit American support for some of Mr. Putinâ€™s objectives in Syria, perhaps Russia still poses a real threat in Eastern Europe. Not necessarily. In reality, the Russian government has had only very limited success in Ukraine. In 2013, a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy was the plan to create a Eurasian Economic Union, a post-Soviet economic bloc with Moscow at its center. Ukraine was supposed to be an essential member. To achieve this goal, Russia was prepared to give Kiev vastly more aid than what the European Union was prepared to offer in support of its vague â€œAssociation Agreement.â€In 2014, the Maidan revolutionaries killed that dream for the foreseeable future. The Eurasian Economic Union today is but a shadow of Mr. Putinâ€™s grand hopes. What has Russia received as compensation? Crimea, which in effect it already controlled, and a small, devastated part of eastern Ukraine. Moscow has made the point that Russia will have to be consulted concerning Ukraineâ€™s future, but Russiaâ€™s economic role alone would have made that essential in any case.Russia has supported rebels in parts of eastern Ukraine, but has not, as the rebels wanted, given them the backing to conquer larger parts of Russian-speaking eastern and southern Ukraine. (This wouldnâ€™t have been difficult considering the terrible state of the Ukrainian military.) Russiaâ€™s restraint in Ukraine shows that there is no serious reason to fear that Mr. Putin is ready to create a new, worse international crisis by attacking the Baltic states or Poland. The Ukrainian crisis is about Ukraine. That is not to say that Russian moves there have been legal or moral. They have, however, been more cautious and pragmatic than the West has recognized.In the end, Russia and the West have landed with a much poorer, more chaotic and more divided version of what they had before 2014: an impoverished, shambolic Ukraine caught permanently between East and West and acting as a source of tension between them. That is not a success for the West â€” or for Russia.American leaders have repeatedly demonstrated that they have no intention of fighting Russia in order to defend Ukraine. This makes sense, not only because of the appalling dangers of such a conflict but also because Ukraine is not a crucial American interest and American forces are heavily committed to facing real threats elsewhere in the world. But if the United States does not intend to fight, does it not make more sense to try to cooperate with Russia? On Syria, the United States and Russia have congruent aims. Mr. Putin has signaled clearly that his country wants to cooperate. Itâ€™s time for Washington to respond accordingly.",1

"Hgar The Horrible cartoonist Chris Browne admitted Thursday that he was disappointed with the lack of attention his syndicated comic received on its 40th anniversary. Its not like I was expecting to be on the cover of TIME or anythingbut would a little feature in USA Today with a headline like Americas Favorite Viking Turns 40 have killed anyone? said Browne, who has been writing and illustrating the strip since the retirement of his father, Dik Browne, who created it in 1973. Or maybe Google could have had Snert the dog barking out their logo. I dont know. Something. Browne said he plans to get plenty of coverage for the 41st anniversary by penning a storyline in which Hgar returns home to find his village burned and his family raped and murdered. ",0
"Retired Police Captain: I Trust #Anonymous More than the FedsBy Carey Wedler In his public Facebook post, he prefaced his allegations with a warning of first-time disclosure. He said, Before explaining the incident, he first asserted that earlier this week while attending a protest against a proposed Atlantic coast pipeline, he was approached by a Department of Homeland Security officer. Lewis said the officer told him that he had to watch a DHS film about him. After providing this context about the degree of federal scrutiny applied to him, Lewis shared another equally disturbing anecdote: Lewis claims the Anonymous member told him the contents of that email: Lewis continued that within a week, he had received a notification that his pension was in jeopardy. Charles Ramsey is a notoriously corrupt cop who recently headed President Obamas Task Force on 2st Century Policing. In contrast, Ray Lewis is a former officer who has protested a variety of policies around the country, from oil profiteering to Wall Street to police brutality. In the post, he included a picture of himself at the Wednesday protest, holding a sign that says WARNING: MASSIVE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IS NEXT. CIVIL is crossed out. Due to the surveillance and targeting Lewis claims to have experienced, he sides with Anonymous over the government. His post concludes, Though it is unclear whether or not Lewis pension was actually revoked four years ago, it is unsettling that he was (and likely is) so closely surveilled and targeted. Nevertheless, these alleged revelations are offset by the fact that fortunately, four years later, his voice has not been silenced.

"As the playground bell sounded on Australian cricketâ€™s version of â€œnext goal winsâ€, it was the quintet of Matt Renshaw, Peter Handscomb, Nic Maddinson, Matthew Wade and Chadd Sayers who emerged victors. Though as the choice of personnel shows, this was not the zero-sum Shield showdown many had feted. Of the five, only two (Renshaw and Handscomb) can lay legitimate claim to having delivered in the Great Audition of 2016. The remaining three (Maddinson, Wade and Sayers), it can be deduced, must have been reasonably close to selection already given their unremarkable performances this round.   Related: Australia make six changes in drastic selection shake-up for third Test   As the five new additions to a squad of 12, the change is sweeping and its scale almost unprecedented. But having never experienced such a sudden dismantling of home hegemony, the national appetite for blood was so ravenous that the level of change offered felt about right. This is an upheaval not only rich in quantity, but variety too. Almost every type of selection is accounted for: Renshaw is the bolter, Handscomb the anointed, Maddinson is potential, Sayers the horse for the course, and Wade was simply recalled.  It is the latter whose selection has evoked the most consternation. Clamour for Wadeâ€™s inclusion seemingly began from nowhere, some weeks ago. It happened in an unnervingly familiar way â€“ a small chorus of Australiaâ€™s retired cricketing elite commenced a call for more â€œgritâ€ and â€œmongrelâ€ in the Australian unit â€“ and weeks later, here he is. Notwithstanding his comparable first-class batting record with vanquished predecessor, Nevill, Wadeâ€™s glovemanship remains at the forefront of national concern.  A Mitchell Johnson-esque recall â€“ where Johnson returned a remodelled man technically and mentally â€“ this isnâ€™t. With 209 runs at 23.22 in his last 10 first-class innings, itâ€™s then difficult to separate Wadeâ€™s inclusion from Steve Smithâ€™s rallying cry for â€œenergyâ€ following Australiaâ€™s relatively recent Sri Lankan capitulation. He may bring that great intangible of â€œmongrelâ€, but will Wade write cheques with his mouth that his keeping canâ€™t cash? Faf du Plessis, Nevill, and the rest of Australia will watch on. However, as with Joe Mennie before him, Wadeâ€™s inclusion is primarily informed by Australiaâ€™s significant and wholesale problem with the blade. Previously the nation may have turned to experienced, but damaged, alternatives. Names like George Bailey, Cameron White and Alex Doolan adorned team sheets and featured in â€œmy best XIâ€ conversations this past week, and not without reason. Bailey has averaged 70 in his last 10 innings, while White has returned to form and Doolan made 202 before retiring hurt. But the selectors instead opted to usher in a new cohort of bladesmen.  There is something instructive in this. Amidst the panic and confusion within Australian cricket broadly, the selections of Renshaw, Maddinson and Handscomb definitively signal the commencement of a batting rebuild. At 20, 24 and 25 respectively, these are players who may form the spine of an Australian batting group for the better part of a decade, if theyâ€™re persevered with. Of the upstarts with viable prospects of selection, it is New South Welshman Kurtis Patterson who finds himself most unlucky. The upright, correct left-hander compiled an elegant half century on a wearing SCG wicket (something his colleagues couldnâ€™t do), and must surely find himself on the cusp of selection in the near future.  Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising selection of the three was that of Maddinson. Averaging 30 from his last 10 innings, the man Nathan Hauritz described on ABC Grandstand as â€œa bit differentâ€ couldnâ€™t rouse himself to Handscomb or Renshaw-esque heights this round. His selection, particularly ahead of the better-performed Patterson, reveals a player with a favourable reputation among selectors though.  This isnâ€™t new. Back in 2011, the late Peter Roebuck wrote of Maddinson: â€œInterstaters are entitled to be aggrieved to hear his name mentioned before the deed has been done. But it will be done.â€ Nineteen at the time, Maddinson has always seemed to flit between that characterisation of â€œoverhyped NSW golden boyâ€ or inevitable Test mainstay. Circumstances have helped catapult him into the frame ahead of schedule, much like the remainder of the new batting group.   Related: Solve Australia's cricket crisis: pick your own Adelaide Test team and coach   Set to debut at a younger age than Ricky Ponting, Renshawâ€™s selection is a win for cricket hipsters nationwide. He may have only played 11 first class fixtures but he too has been touted; much in the same way that local band you saw before they were big were touted. On face value he should be utterly unfamiliar to the Australian public, but the England-born 20â€“year-old is a big, left-handed opening batsman from Queensland. Moreover, with scores this round of 108 off 202 balls and 50 off 51 balls, Renshaw appears able to both defend and dominate, much like his 90s likeness did. Nauseating and altogether unfair comparisons with Matthew Hayden will undoubtedly abound, but in times of crisis, laying back and thinking of the 1990s is a nationally certified coping mechanism. Not unfamiliar with throwbacks, Sayersâ€™ inclusion pits him head-to-head once more with the returning Jackson Bird for the third seamers position. Not dissimilar in pace, it may be that Sayersâ€™ exemplary record at his home Adelaide Oval makes him the fourth to debut for the side this Thursday. If this were the case Bird, like Nevill, would be exceedingly unfortunate to again miss out. But whereas an air of experimentation accompanies Australiaâ€™s other selections, there is something reassuring about that of Handscomb. No mere product of often-parochial Victorian advocacy, the St Kilda playerâ€™s growing reputation as Australiaâ€™s next batting mainstay exists because he has the youth and the runs to prove it. Averaging 76.67 from his last 10 first-class innings, it is instructive that his most significant knock â€“ 215 against New South Wales â€“ was staged this week and in these circumstances. For a nation with a worryingly bare cupboard of batting stocks, Handscomb is an exception. His path into the Australian side is the way youâ€™re meant to do it. By any measure, he deserves his place. So for now, the changes have satiated the nationâ€™s desire for blood â€“ but it cannot say for how long. Because a curiosity lies beneath Australiaâ€™s new faces: do they represent the ushering in of a new era, or are they merely another next short-term bet? Whatever the case, as Adelaide nears, hopes will rise. As with Usman Khawajaâ€™s debut in Sydneyâ€™s dead rubber Ashes Test of 2010-11, Australia will once again look for signs of the future before scintillating 50s.",1
"5 Debunked Marijuana Myths The State Uses To Keep America In The Stone AgeBy Jack Burns But even with so many Americans voting against the long-standing federal ban on a natural, healing herb, a plant no-less, much misconception still abounds with respect to marijuana, its users, and the impact it has on society. In the following essay, a close examination of the claims against cannabis will be examined, and hopefully, in the end, a better understanding will take place, and myths long associated with cannabis use will finally be dispelled. Its been said so much it may seem like an immutable fact, Marijuana is a gateway drug. But nothing could be further from the truth. According to one research study (Morral, 2002) which sought to examine the available research theorizing cannabis to be a gateway drug, marijuana users were only likely to try harder drugs if they were offered those drugs by a friend or a dealer, for example. The researchers concluded, something like a marijuana gateway effect probably does exist, if only because marijuana purchases bring users in contact with the black market that also brings increases access to hard drugs. In other words, the researchers concluded since marijuana is illegal for most purchasers, even purchasers where marijuana may be legal (whose users may not be card carrying medicinal marijuana licensed users), those who are seeking marijuana may find themselves faced with temptation to use harder drugs because street dealers will sell them any drug they may be peddling. The researchers concluded that only a tiny fraction of marijuana users are at risk for turning to harder drugs, simply because those said individuals have a propensity to experimenting with those harder drugs. With those conclusions in mind, being able to regulate marijuana like alcohol, even allowing for it to be purchased for recreational use, will permitcannabis users and those wishing to experiment with cannabis to come in contact with just marijuana, not the other harder drugs found on the street. Proponents of marijuana foresee a day where its sold only at tightly regulateddispensaries and believe that a legal system is the only real and effective way to combat the criminal black market. Such dispensaries provide a safe place to do business, free from the shame and stigma of buying drugs off the street and away from the availability of harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Citing the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, Forbesreported thatnot only is marijuana use safer than alcohol use when it comes to driving, but far fewer fatalities are recorded when marijuana is present than when alcohol is present in traffic fatality instances. It looks like marijuanas impact on traffic safety has been greatly exaggerated, writes Forbes. Theres no question marijuana use impairs a persons ability to operate a vehicle, especially when the drivers are young and male. But in Colorado, where recreational marijuana is currently legal, driving under the influence (DUI) citations are on the decline, as reported by the Denver Post, and highway fatalities are at an historic low, according to The Washington Post. Compared to alcohol, which is legal in all 50 states, cannabis is much safer. Forbes writes, a 2015 National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) studyfound no statistically significant association between marijuana use and crash risk once the researchers adjusted for confounding variables (such as the aforementioned age and sex). The explanation for this difference may be that the NHTSA analysis included any drivers who tested positive for active THC, whether or not they were still feeling the effects. Given these statistics, one might hypothesize that if those who are currently drinking and driving, would give up alcohol, and use marijuana instead, driving under the influence fatalities might further diminish. However, more research into that theory should be undertaken before any such conclusion could be drawn. Actually, the War on Drugs produces more criminals than the substances do, according to one recent editorial. Fox News John Stossel addressed the issue of drugs and violence saying, Violent? People who get high are rarely violent. The violence occurs because when somethings illegal, it is sold only on the black market. And that causes crime. Drug dealers cant just call the cops if someone tries to steal their supply. So they form gangs and arm themselves to the teeth. Some police officers agree. Neil Franklin, a 33-year veteran police officer from Maryland used to kick down doors during drug raids and admitted he used to feel that drugs made people violent. Franklin now is a proponent for ending the prohibition against cannabis, leading the group known as LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. It must be difficult to be an opponent of marijuana reform. They cant make arguments against legalization based on logic and facts so they must constantly resort to fear-based hypotheticals and anecdotes that keep getting proved wrong by systematic study. I feel for them. I really do, he said. Citing a longitudinal research study by the University of Texas, Dallas, LEAP maintains where marijuana is legal, the crime rates for homicides and assault are slightly lower. Franklin told Stossel, We have the violence of these gangs competing for market share, and people get hurt. He added the current police tactics in the war on drugs are ineffective and actually create more war on drug victims. Drugs can be and are in many cases problematic, he told Stossel adding, But the policies that we have in place to prohibit their use are 10 times more problematic. When police officers decide to start busting down doors in a frenetic search for drugs, We end up with kids being shot search warrants being served on the wrong home, innocent people on the other side of the door thinking that they are protecting their home, he stated lamenting his role in police raids. Stossel indicated that legalizing all drugs, following the example set by the country of Portugal, might actuallyreduce drug addiction and end the notion that police officers and modern-day policing are the enemies, allowing law enforcement to focus their attentions on real crime and hardened criminals. The failure of the war on drugs may best be described by USA Todays editorial board. With an average 78 Americans dyingeach day from overdoses of prescription opioid painkillers and heroin, its clear that the U.S.is losing the war on drugs.The epidemic has spread to suburbia and rural areas. The death toll from heroinhas more than tripled since 2010. And the nation is desperate for answers, they write. The truth is that the real drug killers of Americans are powerful prescription pain pills, opiates, and as The Free Thought Project has faithfully reported, their abuse has reached epidemic levels, now accounting for more fatalities than car accidents. All the while, marijuana is showing promise as a much safer alternativefor pain than deadly opiates. In fact, in states where marijuana is legalized in some form, opiate deaths have plummeted. According to one pro-marijuana legalization advocacy group, citingthe Colorado Department of Revenues marijuana statistics, the regulated marijuana market generated more than $156 million in state tax revenue and license fees in FY 2015-2016, including $40 million in tax revenue for school construction projects fulfilling the promise of Amendment 64 plus an addition $2.45 million also earmarked for public schools. These figures do not include local taxes and fees (e.g. Denver). If the schools never see a dime of the revenue being brought in from legal medical and recreational marijuana sales, it may be due to legislative appropriation and not revenue generation. In other words, the moneys coming in, but citizens must be vigilant to ensure lawmakers simply dont spend it for some other purpose than in schools and education. Millions of Americans have tried marijuana, but most are not regular users [and] few marijuana users become dependent on it [A]lthough [some] marijuana users develop dependence, they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs (including alcohol and nicotine), and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugs, concluded a federal study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine. Drug treatment facilities also know this. While it is possible for one to seek treatment for cannabis dependence, few drug treatment facilities will even consider admitting someone if their drug of choice iscannabis Theres a reason why stoners chill when they smoke weed. Its because cannabis relaxes its users, who are much less likely to become violent while stoned. One research study concluded cannabis use reduces likelihood of violence and concluded alcohol is clearly the drug with the most evidence to support a direct intoxication-violence relationship. Put simply, your town drunk is more likely to pick a fight with you than your neighborhood pothead is. According to one source, The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 30,000 annual U.S. deaths are attributed to the health effects of alcohol (i.e. this figure does not include accidental deaths). On the other hand, the CDC does not even have a category for deaths caused by the health effects of marijuana. A study published in Scientific Reports in January 2015 found that the mortality risk associated with marijuana was approximately 114 times less than that of alcohol. Going further, there has never been a case of an individual dying from a marijuana overdose. Meanwhile, the CDC attributes more than 1,600 U.S. deaths per year to alcohol poisoning. Alcohol has been known to cause cirrhosis of the liver as well. But weed works as an anti-inflammatory, and a natural anti-depressant, potentially much safer than the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and carries no black box warning label like they do. As far as cancer is concerned, the organization Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol stated, Alcohol use is associated with a wide variety of cancers, including cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, lungs, pancreas, liver and prostate. Marijuana use has not been conclusively associated with any form of cancer. In fact, a 2009 study contradicted the long-time government claim that marijuana use is associated with head and neck cancers. It found that marijuana use actually reduced the likelihood of head and neck cancers. If you are concerned about marijuana being associated with lung cancer, you may be interested in the results of the largest case-controlled study ever conducted to investigate the respiratory effects of marijuana smoking and cigarette smoking. Released in 2006, the study, conducted by Dr. Donald Tashkin at the University of California at Los Angeles, found that marijuana smoking was not associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Surprisingly, the researchers found that people who smoked marijuana actually had lower incidences of cancer compared to non-users of the drug. So there you have it! Armed with these facts and more, proponents of the legalization of cannabis can take their case to the court of public opinion and win over the jury of their peers, swaying the population to embrace marijuana as medicine for a whole host of illnesses. Those who are sitting cautiously on the fence, waiting to draw their own conclusions now have more research studies to ponder. And proponents of continuing the decades-long prohibition of cannabis no longer have a leg to stand on. Jack Burns writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared. Spot on! The town drunk vs the neighborhood pothead. So true! I cured my fathers cancer with THC. Its medicine but the AMA and Big Pharma dont want people to be able to grow their own medicine for pennies they want to suck the life (and wealth) out of everyone they can. People that work for these industries are monsters they know EXACTLY what theyre doing. Imbibe for the health of it while watching gorgeous Colorado sunsets and a little help from your friends. Maybe its time to find a less derogatory name for pothead? Pot most likely came from the Spanish word potiguaya which apparently meant cannabis leaves years ago. I dont have a replacement word myself. Anyone? planthead.serenityhead.creativehead Those are good. Planthead made me think Herbhead- in honor of Bob Marley. I have a book about Bob Marleys life titled Catch A Fire and among his quotes regarding pot , he says it makes you wise . That would be a wisehead . Another quote of his it makes your come taste sweet . That would be a sweethead I read that bio too, wonderful book. Indeed .. Pot is not good for the prostate and also stops deep REM sleep from occurring. It is a great plant with many uses but nothing is perfect either. And people should not smoke it, smoking it is abusive. It is a vegetable and should be eaten. The best way to be in life is totally 100% sober though, which is how I live. Remember when you were a little kid and were at your happiest? You were sober. But do what you want, obviously. We were not happy as children because we were sober, we were still connected to earth and not connected to the matrix. Schooling disconnected us. Children who are homeschooled and screened from TV, violence, technology, etc. by parents who understand this remain very happy, per their own assessment. Is there research showing the cannabis/REM connection? That certainly hasnt been my experience, but Im also careful not to partake of sativa strains at night because they increase motivation and creative activity. Major psychoactive difference between sativas and indicas. It has been found that many animals seek out ways of getting high. The Sleeping Sharks seek out cave areas with electrical fields that buzz them into a snoozing stupor. Bird and elephants alike seek out fermenting berries and other fruits. Birds love eating pot seeds. Animals of all kinds dig getting high. Its part of the animal experience. ",0
"MORENO VALLEY, Calif. â€” Once heralded as a vital check on corporate influence over government, Californiaâ€™s ballot initiative system â€” which allows residents to propose laws and approve them by popular vote â€” has been used to sharply cut property taxes and to enact the countryâ€™s first medical marijuana law.But these days, developers are using the process for another purpose: to sidestep state environmental laws and speed major developments.Plans for a stadium in Carson, a shopping center north of San Diego and a vast warehouse complex in Moreno Valley were approved last year using the ballot initiative process. Another ballot measure petition hastened construction of a stadium in Inglewood, where the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League will play.The advantage for developers is clear: Projects approved by ballot measures avoid legal challenges under the California Environmental Quality Act.There is a twist, though: Residents often do not even have a chance to vote.Once 15 percent of eligible voters have signed a petition, a project qualifies for the ballot, and local elected officials can call a special election or accept the proposal without negotiating changes. Officials often approve the project to avoid paying for a special election that could further strain tight budgets.Supporters of the ballot measures say they allow residents to override a broken system in which lawsuits and environmental reviews can delay projects for years.But environmentalists argue that the arrangement grants special privileges to developers, even if only a relatively small fraction of residents support a project. And land-use experts say the strategy will become more common unless the state government steps in to curtail it.So far, the issue has failed to attract much attention in Sacramento.â€œWeâ€™ve ended up with a warping of direct democracy to defeat strong environmental laws,â€ said Douglas Carstens, a lawyer specializing in land use and the environment. â€œItâ€™s ramping up. Within a year or two, people will realize what a bad situation this is.â€Developers have complained for decades about the California Environmental Quality Act, which is far more exacting than federal regulations. The state law requires them to identify and mitigate the environmental effects of their projects. No state agency oversees the law; it is enforced only by lawsuits. Written broadly, the law allows almost anyone to sue, claiming environmental harm that can range from destroying animal habitats to blocking a view. The litigation can add years and millions of dollars to a projectâ€™s cost.Walmart has pioneered the use of ballot initiatives to speed construction over the last decade. Since 2009, the company has taken plans for stores to the ballot in at least nine cities across the state; elected officials approved the measures without a vote in eight of those cases.The company recently gathered enough signatures in Desert Hot Springs for a ballot measure that would clear the way for a new superstore.A Walmart spokeswoman, Delia Garcia, said the ballot initiative was â€œa way to move the process forward,â€ but she would not address whether the company was using the process to avoid potential lawsuits.â€œWe really wanted to give the public a chance to weigh in,â€ Ms. Garcia said of the decision to put the Desert Hot Springs store on the ballot. â€œWe knew there was strong community support. In 21 days, we surpassed the required number of signatures.â€The California Supreme Court affirmed Walmartâ€™s strategy in a 2014 decision rejecting a challenge to the companyâ€™s expansion of a store in Sonora. An elected board, the court ruled, may approve a ballot measure petition without a special election, and that project can then bypass an environmental review.After the decision, more developers began following Walmartâ€™s approach.The court ruling offered â€œa road mapâ€ for how to avoid the environmental review process, said Richard Frank, a former chief deputy attorney general in California who began working on Environmental Quality Act cases shortly after the law was signed in 1970.â€œWhat is troublesome to me is that some members of the regulated community are using the Supreme Court decision to circumvent the true intent of the law,â€ he said.Some city officials, frustrated by lawsuits, see the end run around the state environmental act as a useful way to speed construction.In Carlsbad, the plan to build a shopping complex was certain to prompt a lawsuit until the developer, Caruso Affiliated, circulated a petition to put it on the ballot. The City Council approved the measure outright in a unanimous vote.â€œThey would meet our growth standards, and our vote would give them security about litigation,â€ Mayor Matt Hall said. Noting that a desalination plant in town had faced more than a dozen lawsuits and appeals, he added that the state environmental law had â€œbecome more of a weapon than a shield.â€Mr. Frank, the former lawyer in the California attorney generalâ€™s office, said that this use of the ballot initiative system â€œsmacks of a collusive process.â€Nowhere have ties between a developer and elected officials come under more scrutiny than in Moreno Valley. After the City Council approved plans to build the largest warehouse complex in the United States, environmental groups sued, contending that the complex would add nearly 70,000 car and truck trips a day to an area that already had some of the most polluted air in the country. The developer, Highland Fairview, had also spent heavily to aid the election of the three Council members who supported the project.So backers of the project gathered signatures for a ballot initiative, and then the Council approved it outright â€” shielding the project from environmental lawsuits.Jeffrey Giba, one of the councilmen who supported the project, called the environmental lawsuits â€œan extortion racket.â€â€œI donâ€™t want to spend my cityâ€™s money on a special election when we already approved the project once,â€ he said.Responding to accusations of collusion with the developer, he said, â€œNobody bought me.â€Although environmental activists are leaning on state officials to close the loophole, no new legislation has been proposed this year.In the meantime, residents have tried to force local public votes. But they say it is difficult to fight developers that can put millions toward the projects.In Carlsbad, an affluent seaside community, residents gathered enough signatures to force a referendum on the shopping center. Voters narrowly rejected the project in March, overriding the Councilâ€™s previous approval.Deâ€™Ann Weimer, who helped organize opposition to the shopping center, said that despite her groupâ€™s victory, it was unrealistic to expect residents to continually fight companies like Caruso Affiliated, which spent more than $10 million pushing for the shopping center. Her group spent about $100,000 in the months before the referendum.â€œItâ€™s an unfair playing field when an organization has this much power and money and resources,â€ she said.In Moreno Valley, a working-class city where people are clamoring for jobs, opponents of the warehouse complex said the process had effectively allowed the developer, Highland Fairview, to buy the right to build what it wanted.Opponents later tried to force a referendum, but they failed to gather enough signatures. Highland Fairview spent more than $1 million since the beginning of 2015 in support of the warehouse complex; the local opposition group raised less than half as much.â€œIf weâ€™d all had the same amount of money to plead our case, it would have been different,â€ said George Price, a city councilman who opposes the warehouses. He estimated that 90 percent of the residents in his district, where the project will be built, opposed the complex.Echoing Walmartâ€™s argument, the chief executive of Highland Fairview, Iddo Benzeevi, said the 49,000 signatures gathered in favor of the ballot measure proved the publicâ€™s support.â€œComplaints about money spent to educate voters are not surprising,â€ Mr. Benzeevi said in an email. â€œOpponents simply lost their argument with the community.â€",1

"Adobe Security Breach Could Affect As Many As 150 Million UsersChris Dougherty Brad Arkin, Chief Security Officer for Adobe, said We also believe the attackers removed from our systems certain information relating to 2.9 million Adobe customers, including customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to customer orders. In a blog post this week by Brian Krebs, it was revealed that early estimates were far too low and the actual number of customer accounts affected by the breach may have been in the tens of millions.

"In Charlotte, N.C., the lines for the first wave of early balloting last month forced some voters to wait more than two hours. In Las Vegas last weekend, voters were still waiting outside a polling place in a Mexican grocery store two hours after it was set to close. In New York City on Election Day, voters who spilled out of polling sites snaked through schoolyards and around entire city blocks.There are two ways to interpret these scenes.â€œIt does give some indication of the health of our democracy that you have all these people who are excited enough to vote that theyâ€™ll wait in a long line,â€ said Stephen Pettigrew, a Ph.D. candidate in Harvardâ€™s department of government who studies polling lines. â€œBut itâ€™s also an indication, at least in some areas, that there is a problem.â€One problem is that some groups are much more likely to face long lines than others. Another, according to Mr. Pettigrewâ€™s research on recent elections, is that the people who do wait are less likely to vote in the future as a result.Early voters, urban voters and minority voters are all more likely to wait and wait and wait. In predominantly minority communities, the lines are about twice as long as in predominantly white ones, Mr. Pettigrew has found. And minority voters are six times as likely as whites to wait longer than an hour to vote. Those disparities have persisted even within the same town or county, suggesting they donâ€™t reflect simply the greater difficulty of putting on elections in populous cities.â€œThat means members of minority communities are forgoing wages; theyâ€™re having to juggle child and family care and all sorts of other things that white voters donâ€™t have to do,â€ said Charles Stewart III, an M.I.T. political scientist. (In a presidential election, he has estimated, all this waiting nationwide adds up to a billion dollars in lost wages.)Voting essentially costs people more in minority communities, and that also makes them particularly susceptible to the long waitâ€™s other effect. Mr. Pettigrewâ€™s research suggests that for each hour would-be voters wait, their probability of voting in the next election drops by one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but Mr. Pettigrew estimates that this means 200,000 people didnâ€™t vote in 2014 because of the lines they encountered in 2012 (and thatâ€™s accounting for the lower turnout weâ€™d expect in a midterm election).Even the most effective get-out-the-vote tactics budge turnout by only three or four percentage points, at best. So long lines are a relatively powerful way to influence behavior. In concerns over minority turnout in particular, the publicâ€™s focus has fallen much more on the consequences of stricter voter ID laws and fewer early voting days. But long lines can have a similar effect, depressing turnout too.Mr. Pettigrew, whose data also shows that predominantly white precincts tend to receive more voting machines and poll workers, doesnâ€™t argue that these patterns necessarily prove discrimination. Election officials may have reacted slowly, for example, to shifting dynamics in who votes. Historically, white turnout has been higher than black turnout â€” a pattern broken for the first time in 2012.But regardless of whether party officials are actively trying to depress minority turnout â€” a question litigated extensively over the last several years as the Supreme Court has weakened the Voting Rights Act â€” the effective outcome of these disparities matters.â€œI can understand long lines randomly appearing in places because of weird idiosyncratic forces,â€ Mr. Pettigrew said. â€œI think itâ€™s not O.K. for there to be this systematic pattern in certain areas of long lines.â€For the vast majority of voters, this issue never arises. In 2012, voters waited an average of about 14 minutes to cast a ballot. Only about 5 percent waited longer than an hour. But that small fraction, in a presidential election, is several million voters.Those voters might be deterred in the future for several reasons. As the costs of voting rise, research suggests, people are less likely to do so. And many of us vote not because we think weâ€™ll cast the deciding ballot, but for the civic experience â€” the chance to get that sticker, to join in the communal exercise, to feel patriotic. If the experience itself (or the customer service around it) is unpleasant, that undercuts one of the main reasons to do it.Mr. Stewartâ€™s own surveys also show that people who wait longer to vote have less confidence that their votes are counted accurately. As a result, long waits may signal to voters that the entire election system is flawed. Just as unfair traffic stops can test faith in the criminal justice system, dysfunctional lines may undermine belief in American elections. And so why vote next time?In North Carolina, where a federal court struck down voting restrictions that it said targeted blacks with â€œalmost surgical precision,â€ there were reports this election of black voters who encountered long lines and gave up.â€œIn America, we have heightened awareness about racial disparities,â€ Mr. Stewart said. â€œAnd isnâ€™t it really sad to say hereâ€™s yet another area in which the racial disparities exist, particularly in light of the fact that one of the top goals of African-American political activism for a century has been access to the poll.â€",1
"Investors flocked into the haven of gold on Wednesday amid jitters in the global financial markets prompted by fears that Donald Trump could pull off a shock Brexit-style victory in the US presidential race. Shares and the US dollar also fell after opinion polls suggested that the contest between Trump and his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, was now too close to call. Wall Streetâ€™s assumption that Clinton was cruising to a comfortable victory has been shattered by the FBIâ€™s announcement on Friday that it was looking into a batch of freshly discovered emails that might have a bearing on its investigation into the former US secretary of state.     Hillary Clinton: â€˜There is no caseâ€™ in FBI email investigation â€“ video  As the battle for the White House entered its final days, evidence that Clintonâ€™s seemingly unassailable lead has been whittled away led investors to speculate on a repeat of the UKâ€™s EU referendum in June, when opinion polls were suggesting a victory for the remain side throughout the campaign and up until the polls closed. â€œNow that itâ€™s a bit less certain that [Clinton] is going to win, weâ€™re seeing the impact of investors finally taking evasive action â€“ probably evasive action which they should have taken a month ago,â€ said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. â€œThe caution is setting in.â€  Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: â€œDespite seeming improbable to most of us for the majority of the last year, the prospect of a Trump presidency has long unsettled economists and market analysts, who predicted he would bring uncertainty to markets. â€œThis was highlighted [on Wednesday] by a poll that showed that a Trump win was the likely result of next weekâ€™s election, causing global markets to panic and investors to back away from the dollar. Now that the stability represented by Clinton is no longer assured, the following week will be a tense period as global markets seek to avoid the kind of complacency shown before the Brexit vote.â€ Gold rose $15 to stand at just over $1,300 an ounce as investors sought out safe havens in the event of a defeat for Clinton. Meanwhile, the dollar lost ground against the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the recently battered pound. Sterling was up two-thirds of a cent against the greenback to just over $1.23 â€“ its highest level in three weeks. Shares dropped on the worldâ€™s major bourses, with the leading index of UK shares â€“ the FTSE 100 â€“ closing 72 points lower at 6,845. In New York, the S&P 500 was on course in early trading to post its seventh consecutive day of losses.    Donald Trump smiles during a campaign rally in Miami. Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters   Financial markets were also rattled by a 3% drop in oil prices following news of the biggest increase in crude stocks in the US since modern records began in 1982. The cost of a barrel of US light crude dropped by almost $1.50 on news that oil inventories in the past week had jumped by more than 14bn barrels compared with the 1bn barrel increase dealers had expected. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, continued its wait-and-see approach to interest rates at the end of a two-day meeting. But the Fed dropped a broad hint that it would act at its next meeting in December by saying that there was not enough evidence â€œfor the time beingâ€ to warrant higher borrowing costs. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, said there was a risk that the unsettled mood in the financial markets could linger on even when the result of next Tuesdayâ€™s election was known since there was a risk of a repeat of events 16 years ago when the race between George Bush and Al Gore was finally decided by the Supreme Court weeks after polling day. â€œThe presidential election race is now too close to call, raising the possibility of a near-tied election result that would be aggressively disputed by one or both of the candidates,â€ Hunter said. â€œUnder those circumstances, the infamous 2000 election suggests that the uncertainty could persist for at least a month and could weigh heavily on the stock market during that time.â€  ",1
"SBS is launching a new youth-focused channel called SBS Viceland on 15 November, replacing SBS2. The new channel will be owned and operated by SBS but will be programmed with content from the US-Canadian media company Vice. It is a free-to-air channel that will be available on television and online platforms.  SBS2 was launched in 2009. In 2013 it rebranded with a younger focus and an orange logo, as well as a flagship program, The Feed, hosted by Marc Fennell. The managing director of Vice Australia, Michael Slonim, said the partnership would â€œhelp catapult Vice further into the consciousness of young Australiansâ€. â€œSBS shares our storytelling sensibilities and curiosity about the world, and weâ€™re delighted to be partnering up to bring Viceland to this market in the biggest way possible,â€ he said.   Related: ABC boss Mark Scott questions whether Australia still needs SBS   The global media company announced this year it would launch in more than 50 new countries, including many in the Middle East and Africa, and expand services in existing markets including Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The SBS managing director, Michael Ebeid, said â€œexploring diversity through cultureâ€ was at the heart of SBSâ€™s purpose, and Vice would bring some of the best available content from across the world. The programming is yet to be revealed but the channel will continue to feature SBS2 shows such as The Feed as well as Vice shows on culture, music, sport, fashion and technology.  Viceland, created by the director Spike Jonze, was launched in the US this year with programs including Gaycation (with Ellen Page and Ian Daniel), Huangâ€™s World (with Eddie Huang), Noisey (with Zach Goldbaum) and F*ck, Thatâ€™s Delicious (with Action Bronson).  In August the siteâ€™s founder, Shane Smith, said traditional media companies had failed to connect with young audiences or cover the issues they were interested in.  Last month the Columbia Journalism Review criticised Vice for its treatment of freelance journalists in the US. â€œJournalists who have worked for Vice tell CJR that the company published their work without paying them for it, promised them assignments which were later rescinded, and asked reporters for their help with documentaries that covered issues they had written about without any plans to pay them for their work,â€ the review reported.  Vice responded by outlining steps it planned to take to improve the relationship.",1
"With hours to go before the winner of this yearâ€™s Man Booker prize is announced, former Waterstones bookseller Graeme Macrae Burnetâ€™s tale of murder in a Scottish crofting community, His Bloody Project, is comfortably outselling the rest of the shortlist. But Madeleine Thienâ€™s Do Not Say We Have Nothing has emerged as the frontrunner at the bookies.    Best sales â€¦ Graeme Macrae Burnet. Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP     Related: His Bloody Project review by Graeme Macrae Burnet â€“ murder in the Highlands   Published by tiny Scottish independent publisher Saraband, His Bloody Project â€“ described as â€œa fiendishly readable tale that richly deserves the wider attention the Booker has brought itâ€ in the Guardianâ€™s review â€“ had sold just one copy in the week before it was longlisted for the Â£50,000 prize in July. According to statistics from Nielsen BookScan, its life sales at that point were just 561 copies. Following the longlist announcement, it sold 5,622 copies, and in the weeks since the six-strong shortlist was unveiled on 13 September, it has sold an additional 24,079 copies â€“ well ahead of the second bestselling title, Ottessa Moshfeghâ€™s thriller Eileen, which has sold just over 11,000 copies since the shortlist was announced. â€œOur bestselling title by some distance is His Bloody Project. A cracking plot combined with the literary kudos bestowed upon it by the Booker judges seems to have created a kind of commercial alchemy â€“ which has made it not only our bestselling Booker title but one of our bestselling titles full stop,â€ said Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White. â€œAlso, from a personal perspective, itâ€™s wonderful to see a former Waterstones bookseller having such success.â€    Shortened odds â€¦ Madeleine Thien.

Do Not Say We Have Nothing was backed from 12/1 to 7/4 favourite at William Hill, and is also 2/1 favourite at Ladbrokes. William Hill has Deborah Levyâ€™s Hot Milk at 11/4, His Bloody Project at 4/1, Paul Beattyâ€™s The Sellout at 5/1, David Szalayâ€™s All That Man Is at 7/1 and Eileen at 8/1 to win the prize. â€œThirty-four per cent of all the stakes on the outcome of the Booker have been for Madeleine Thien, with 26% of all bets placed on her,â€ said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe, â€œThe Canadian author tops each of these categories and has been backed down from 12/1 when the longlist was issued, to 5/1 when the shortlist was announced, then to 3/1 and now to 7/4 clear favourite, relegating Deborah Levy to second favourite.â€ At Ladbrokes, Alex Donohue said: â€œThe literary runners and riders are still tightly bunched entering the final straight. The trends favour a win for either Thien or Levy, but in a year of shocks and surprises it wouldnâ€™t be that much of an upset at all for anyone to take the prize.â€",1
"Saying it was the furthest thing from his mind when he clocked in each day at the Northwestern Steel and Wire factory in the 1950s, retired laborer Henry Mitchell, 84, told reporters Monday that he had absolutely no idea his earnings from six decades ago would have to support the next three generations of his family. Back then, I knew I needed the money I was making on the production line to feed and clothe my kids, but I really had no clue that my grandkids and even their kids would still rely on it all these years later, said Mitchell, noting that, had he realized his wages operating a metal rolling machine during the middle of the previous century would eventually be called upon to provide for 11 separate family members, he would have done a better job budgeting his weekly salary of $65. At this point, Ive pretty much run through my savings paying off my sons mortgage. And, no matter how I cut it, my pension dollars just arent going to stretch much farther, not with [grandchildren] Tom and Karen still out of work and five great-grandchildren who will one day need to go to college. Boy, I wish Id gotten that promotion to furnace operator sooner.

"Retail sales fell less than expected nationwide in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, but a sharp downward revision to Januaryâ€™s data could reignite concerns about the economyâ€™s growth prospects.The weak report bucked the trend of recent labor market data that had suggested the economy remained on solid ground despite some fears of a looming recession.The data could give the Federal Reserve more reason to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, when it will release its latest policy statement.â€œBased on todayâ€™s lackluster sales report, policy makers will be in no hurry to raise interest rates,â€ said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.Retail sales dipped 0.1 percent last month as automobile purchases fell and cheaper gasoline undercut receipts at service stations. Januaryâ€™s retail sales were revised down to show a 0.4 percent drop instead of the 0.2 percent gain previously reported.Underscoring the reportâ€™s weakness, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent increase in January.These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have risen 0.6 percent in January. Economists had forecast retail sales slipping 0.2 percent and core retail sales advancing 0.2 percent in February.Last monthâ€™s weak core retail sales reading, together with Januaryâ€™s modest gain, suggest that consumer spending will probably remain tepid in the first quarter after growing at a 2.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.Economic growth prospects were further dented by another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories edging up 0.1 percent in January as sales continued to decline.That pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio to its highest level since May 2009, suggesting inventories could remain a drag on growth in the near term.In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month on lower energy and food costs, after edging up 0.1 percent in January.In the 12 months through February, the index was unchanged after falling 0.2 percent in January.An important measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.2 percent in January. The so-called core producer price index was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through February, the largest gain since last July.â€œThese increases argue against the idea that deflation risks are spilling over into the U.S. economy,â€ said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.",1
"Fears for how Trumpâ€™s America will unfold have spurred activists to start organizing aggressively and creatively for his presidency, from starting self-defense classes for women to calling on people to move to swing states. Trumpâ€™s campaign was always rather light on policy detail, but that hasnâ€™t stopped progressives from preparing for the worst.  Hereâ€™s a list of the solutions citizens are coming up with: Safe houses for undocumented immigrants John from San Francisco, who asked for his surname not be to used, has started compiling lists of people with spare bedrooms and undocumented immigrants in need of safe houses in case mass deportations begin. He got the idea after a friend, who is undocumented, spoke of his fears for himself, his wife, child and friends under Trump. Trump campaigned on tougher border control and deportations of undocumented immigrants. John offered to host his friend at his own apartment, but the man replied: â€œWhat about all my friends too?â€ So he called out on social media to friends and acquaintances who would be willing to host an undocumented individual or family and has collected more than 100 safe houses in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Portland. He has also got about 60 undocumented migrants who he will match with a safe house person, offering them housing but also just contact and help from outside the Latino community, in case they need a person to call for help. â€œBy the time we need to use this list, itâ€™ll be too late to make one and so better start it now and hopefully it doesnâ€™t come to this,â€ he told the Guardian. Birth control: call to get IUDs Contraception is covered for free under Obamacare, but with Trump promising the repeal it, women are being encouraged to get IUDs, which can last up to five years, as long-form birth control.  GET AN IUD TOMORROWâ€” Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) November 9, 2016   Women: organize. But first, get an IUD.â€” Elizabeth Plank (@feministabulous) November 10, 2016  A community-written document called The â€œOh Shit! What Should I Do Before January?â€ guide, started by artist Ariel Federow, offers a plethora of health tips including encouraging people to stockpile the morning after pill and calling on medical students to get abortion training, since Trump wants to overturn Roe v Wade, the US supreme court decision that protects abortion access. â€œIf you have been putting off dealing with something medically or administratively, especially something that relates to intersection with the federal government, this is the moment,â€ reads the guide. Currently itâ€™s on Google docs, but Federow is looking at building a Wiki site so that it can be more easily accessible. Passports for trans people Often official identification with correct gender markers can be a bureaucratic nightmare for trans people â€“ and it could get worse. â€œIf youâ€™re trans and you havenâ€™t been getting around to changing your gender marker on your passport, get to it,â€ said Federow, 33, a Brooklyn resident. â€œThatâ€™s been easy to do so far because of an Obama executive order.â€ Because itâ€™s an executive order, Trump could immediately repeal it. Self-defense classes for women After his â€œgrab â€™em by the pussyâ€ comments, plus at least a dozen women alleging sexual misconduct by Trump, many women are fearful of the kind of behavior that has been legitimized by Trumpâ€™s election. Timothy Faust, a 28-year-old Austin resident, is the general manager of Party World Rasslin, a theatrical wrestling event. A woman in the PWR Facebook group mentioned that following the election of Trump, she wished she â€œknew a bit of self-defenseâ€. â€œMy job is to be quiet and to listen to folks who say what they need and do whatever they can do get them what they need,â€ said Faust. And so Faust used his networks to put a callout for a self-defense instructor and within two hours a class was organized for this Sunday with Katie Jackson, an owner and instructor at Lions Krav Maga, an Austin self-defense studio. â€œ2017 looms and DARKWAR seems realer than ever â€“ we cannot promise you everything will be OK, but we promise you that your friends at PWR have your back,â€ reads the Facebook invite. The class costs $10, with proceeds going to the The Lilith Fund, a charity that helps fund abortions. Protect yourself from surveillance During the campaign Trump spoke about a register of all Muslims. Although he has backed away from that plan in recent months, having him in charge of the National Security Agencyâ€™s domestic surveillance, which Edward Snowden revealed in depth in 2013, means Trump can track citizens or groups. As journalist Alex Hern wrote in the Guardian this week:  Protecting yourself from surveillance by the NSA isnâ€™t easy, but with information security technologies it is possible. In fact, itâ€™s possible to fit the basic guidelines in a tweet, like this from the pseudonymous security researcher the grugq:   .@snowden OPSEC guide:- use Signal- use Tor- use full disk encryption- use a password manager- use two factor authSolid basics.â€” the grugq (@thegrugq) November 23, 2015  This article explains exactly how you go about using the best tools available to avoid NSA surveillance.

"Supporters of wind and solar energy were urging Congress on Wednesday to renew a federal grant program credited with jump-starting renewable power projects nationwide. The incentive program is set to expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts -- but the odds of that happening narrowed when the initiative was left out of a tax cut package developed by the Obama administration and congressional Republicans. Under the grant program, companies can nab direct cash payments from the Treasury Department that cover up to 30 percent of the cost of building qualified renewable projects. The initiative was created as part of last year's stimulus package in response to concerns that the economic downturn had caused traditional renewable energy financing tied to investment and production tax credits to dry up. Because that tax credit financing market hasn't rebounded, the incentive program is 'the most important policy for continued growth of the renewable energy industry in the United States,' said Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association in a conference call with reporters. Tens of thousands of jobs tied to the construction of wind farms, solar arrays and geothermal operations financed by the incentive program hang in the balance, Resch said. In Texas -- the nation's leader for wind power generation -- more than 3,000 jobs 'in the manufacturing pipeline' for new projects are threatened, said Denise Bode, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. 'Without continuation of this policy, we will absolutely have layoffs ahead,' Bode said. Faced with the program's possible demise, renewable energy executives are making personal pleas to lawmakers, and industry lobbyists are circulating on Capitol Hill with fact sheets that show what projects are benefiting in every state. 'We've pretty much dropped everything as an industry' to fight for the program, Resch said, adding: 'It really is an all-out effort.' If Congress doesn't reauthorize the grant program, it would mean a second blow to the renewable energy sector, which already failed this year to convince lawmakers to require that utilities must derive more of their electricity from the wind, sun and other easily replenished sources. That would have helped drive demand for renewable energy and helped it compete with lower-cost power sources, such as natural gas. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the head of the Senate Finance Committee, had advanced a proposal to extend the program for one year, at an estimated pricetag of $1.3 billion. But it was left out of the tax cut plan developed by the White House earlier this week. That package would temporarily renew Bush-era tax cuts, in exchange for extending unemployment benefits and some tax provisions aimed at middle- and low-income households. 'It's great that the administration and Congress is supporting additional unemployment benefits, but unfortunately many people currently employed by the (renewable power industry) will be standing in line applying for those benefits,' if the grant program isn't renewed, Resch said. The renewable grant program faces opposition from some lawmakers who are reluctant to reauthorize any initiatives borne out of the $789 billion stimulus package. Some Republican lawmakers also have complained that spending on renewable energy leverages an industry that could not survive on its own and otherwise can't compete with oil, gas and coal. Julie Blunden, vice president of public policy for San Jose, Calif.-based Sunpower Corp., suggested the grant program could threaten the firm's plans to expand to a larger facility and open a new office in Austin, Texas. 'We are in the process of growing our business,' she said. 'The Treasury grant is a threshold policy to continue to move that forward.' If the program isn't renewed, renewable energy developers can only qualify for the funding if they begin construction on projects by the end of the year (and complete construction by 2016). That deadline has prompted a mad dash to kick off work on planned projects nationwide, as companies 'try to meet the construction deadline,' Blunden said. 'We're racing to do that.' (Jennifer A.

"JERUSALEM â€” For Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, what was intended as a gesture of respect for a man of peace has brought him anything but peace back home.His brief visit to Jerusalem to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president of Israel, and his handshake with the current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, brought a fierce backlash from many Palestinians who called it an act of betrayal by a leader who has grown out of touch.The youth movement of Mr. Abbasâ€™s own Fatah party at one university declared that he had â€œcommitted a crimeâ€ and called on him to apologize and resign. A Palestinian military officer was so critical of Mr. Abbas on Facebook that security forces went to his home and arrested him. On Twitter, angry Palestinians used Arabic hashtags that translate to #Treason, #CondolenceForTheKiller and #AbbasDoesNotRepresentMe.â€œAbu Mazenâ€™s participation in the funeral is an absolute disgrace to the Palestinian people,â€ Abu Samah, 52, an electrician from Ramallah, said in an interview, using Mr. Abbasâ€™s nickname.Abu Nidal, 36, a taxi driver, complained that Mr. Abbas had joined an Israeli event even as Israelis used force against Palestinians to administer the occupation of the West Bank and continued to build settlements on land claimed by Palestinians.â€œWhy would you honor a man responsible for the killing of your own people and then willingly shake the hands of the current enemy who is continuing to enforce the torture of his people?â€ Mr. Nidal asked. â€œShame on you, Abu Mazen.â€The reaction to Mr. Abbasâ€™s attendance at the funeral underscored divergent views of Mr. Peres. In Israel, the United States and much of the world, he was admired for his part in negotiating the Oslo accords, which won him a Nobel Peace Prize.But he was remembered in the West Bank, in Gaza and elsewhere in the Arab world as an Israeli security hawk who was instrumental in building Israelâ€™s military might and promoted settlements on Palestinian territory. He also launched a military offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1996, during which Israeli artillery shelling of a United Nations base killed scores of Lebanese refugees, many of them children.The wave of criticism also reflects the weakened domestic position for Mr. Abbas and his ruling team after more than a decade in power at the Palestinian Authority. With the peace process frozen, Mr. Abbas has little to show for his cooperation with Israel on security and other matters, according to many Palestinians in the West Bank, who see their leaders as, in effect, Israeli collaborators.To his critics, Mr. Abbas seems less interested in his domestic audience than the international community, particularly in Washington. And yet his international patrons are worried that he is losing the credibility that would be necessary for a peace process to have a chance at success, should it ever be restarted.Mr. Abbas earned praise from world leaders for attending the funeral while other Arab leaders stayed away. In his eulogy, President Obama hailed him for coming. Official Palestinian news agencies published interviews praising Mr. Abbas for acting like a statesman and creating new opportunities for negotiations.Mohammed al-Madani, an adviser to Mr. Abbas who attended the funeral with him, said the decision to go would advance the Palestinian cause internationally.â€œAll the world leaders who were at the funeral applauded the presidentâ€™s participation, and 90 percent of the attendants shook his hands,â€ Mr. Madani told a Fatah-affiliated radio station, according to Maan News, an Arabic news agency. â€œIt was a political move rather than just participation in a funeral.â€Mahmoud Habbash, who served for years as religious affairs adviser for Mr. Abbas, said the Palestinian leader had acted in the best tradition of his faith. The Prophet Muhammad participated in his Jewish neighborâ€™s funeral, he told Arabic news outlets, â€œand Peres is our neighbor.â€The 1996 shelling that killed Lebanese refugees sheltered at the United Nations base made Mr. Abbasâ€™s presence at the funeral especially controversial in Lebanon.â€œThere is nothing worse than the death of the former Israeli president Shimon Peres, quietly, on the land of occupied Palestine, except the pilgrimage of Arab and Palestinian officialdom to participate in his funeral,â€ the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar declared in an editorial.Another Lebanese newspaper, Assafir, described Mr. Abbasâ€™s participation as â€œshaking the hands of a killer at the funeral of a killer.â€The decision gave Mr. Abbasâ€™s foes in Hamas fresh ammunition against him. Mahmoud Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas, told an Iranian television channel that under Islamic law, Mr. Abbas now qualified as a Jew. â€œI pray for Allah that he will join Peres in hell,â€ Mr. Zahar said.The criticism extended inside Mr. Abbasâ€™s Fatah party and across social media. Cartoons mocking him were posted and shared. One such cartoon showed Mr. Abbas placing a wreath on a boot representing Mr. Peres; on Mr. Abbasâ€™s backside was a boot print. A Facebook video posted by a critic who excoriated Mr. Abbas had more than 330,000 views by Sunday evening.The funeral was held as violence, and the fear of it, continued. A Palestinian man stabbed an Israeli soldier on Friday at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem and was then shot to death, according to the Israeli authorities. Israeli forces shut down all crossings with the West Bank for two days for Rosh Hashana, as they typically do during Jewish holidays.The Palestinian authorities have reacted sharply to some of the criticism. Besides arresting the Palestinian officer, who wrote on Facebook that Mr. Abbas had â€œmade a mistakeâ€ by agreeing to â€œparticipate in the funeral of the killer of our people,â€ the authorities shut down the website of the Fatah youth movement at Birzeit University, which had condemned Mr. Abbas for his â€œbetrayal.â€ Several students were reported to have been detained.Mr. Abbas seemed to react to the criticism by taking a hard line on Israel again as soon as he returned home. At a factory groundbreaking ceremony in Bethlehem, he vowed to break the Israeli occupation.â€œIt is true that we are a state under an occupation that persecutes, oppresses, seizes our land piece by piece, runs after our youth and destroys our homes,â€ he said, according to reports from the event.â€œLet them do what they want and build what they want, but we will build our nation and will establish our independent state.â€",1
"Militants wearing military uniforms attacked a balloting center in a remote northern area and killed 10 guards, a senior police official said on Tuesday. The militants showed up at the polling center late Monday in Daqouq, a village outside the northern city of Kirkuk, saying they had come to carry out a search, the police said. Instead they shot and killed the guards. The attack was part of an effort by militants to derail the April 30 parliamentary elections in Sunni-dominated areas.",1
"  10.00pm BST   Apologies again for the tech glitch that prevented us starting on time. But thank you for staying with us and we look forward to normal service - twits doing daftness with commentary - resuming next week. See you in the comments!     9.59pm BST   Next week, they are throwing the team right into the pit with the advertising challenge. It looks like Alan gets pretty angry about jeans next week. Something to look forward to.     9.58pm BST   Michelle is bitter and thinks Rebecca is skating on very thin ice. Back at the house, the teams welcome back Alana and Rebecca and quiz them on what the firing finger jamboree is like.     9.57pm BST   As the drums build itâ€™s Michelle! The PM is fired and she thanks Alan for the opportunity. The opportunity to run around London like a pillock, and have it filmed for TV.     9.56pm BST   Alanâ€™s summarising and he starts with Rebecca. Sheâ€™s a bit meh, Alana didnâ€™t something or other, Michelle didnâ€™t boss good. But Rebecca feels the crosshairs hot on her forehead.     9.55pm BST   Alan says Michelle didnâ€™t take control of her team properly. When do we think weâ€™re going to find out Alana was actually named after Alan by her Apprentice super-fan mum? Perhaps thereâ€™ll be a subplot which reveals sheâ€™s actually Alanâ€™s daughter? Iâ€™m drifting off while they argue.     9.53pm BST   In terms of television, I suppose Rebecca would be the least noticeable loss on account of her not making any kind of impression at all. It would be like Lord Sugar firing water or air.     9.52pm BST   Alana and Michelle turn on Rebecca because she looks a bit weak and an easy target because she sold nowt. Claude also has it in for her. Is she to be the first sacrifice for blending into the wallpaper?     9.51pm BST   Karrren tucks into Alana while the three wait outside. Itâ€™s not long before they are marched back in. Who is getting the firing finger right in their mush?     9.51pm BST   Itâ€™s reality show tradition that a woman should go first. The world is a misogynist. Business is a misogynist.     9.50pm BST   Trishna has put in quite a chippy boardroom performance so far, saying she knew it was all bobbins and she was the only one who tried to do it properly. All eyes turn towards Michelle for want of a better scapegoat.  She brings back Alana and Rebecca. I donâ€™t think she even knows who Rebecca is. I certainly donâ€™t.     9.48pm BST   Grainne appeared briefly there, frozen in the headlights. Has she spoken yet or is she a Westworld escapee stuck in a reverie?     9.48pm BST   Frances (no distinguishing features so far) blames Alana as sub-team leader for the poor pricing policy at the car boot. Natalie (Scots) apologies for selling two Â£300 vases for Â£15. I hope the vasesâ€™ new owner is watching tonight and drinking champagne out of those vases.     9.46pm BST   Lord Sugar aims both barrels at the team in general and Aleksandra (god it takes a long time to type her name) jumps straight in and blames the team leader with a side order of Alana.      9.45pm BST   That tray of polystyrene cups is so depressing. Theyâ€™re not even allowed mugs. Thatâ€™s how austere this segment gets. They donâ€™t deserve china. The arguing begins. Michelle says she isnâ€™t here to make friends and starts fighting for her life. Everyone blames everyone else but not for long as theyâ€™re back in boardroom hell.     9.43pm BST   Never mind the boys lindy-hopping. Cut the bitter recriminations over scummy tea and disconsolate elbows on sad formica.     9.43pm BST   Alan has laid on vintage dance lessons for the boys. Their eyes betray their utter disappointment. The girls, however, look sadder. They are bound for the sad cafe for at least one of them will be fired. Who is going?     9.42pm BST   Titans took Â£1428 and Nebula took Â£959. And there we have it. Boys win. Girls lose.     9.41pm BST   Re the failed sale in Chelsea, Dillon says â€œIt was kind of awkward.â€ At the moment, whenever Dillon speaks I see Jedward talking in unison. Really similar voices.     9.40pm BST   Mukai has sensibly gone with a more sombre bow tie for the boardroom. Iâ€™d actually have admired him more if heâ€™d fronted it out and gone full leopard print.     9.40pm BST   Sofiane strikes me as one of those geezers who Alan will like because â€œyou remind me of a young meâ€.      9.39pm BST   Now onto the boysâ€™ horrible mistakes. JD justifies the name Titans and Alan makes his first zinger of the episode. A truly awful gag about the Greek god of sausages. Who had 38 minutes for the first zinger? Come and collect your prize ham at the end.     9.38pm BST   Michelle doesnâ€™t hang anyone out to dry and says they were all smashing. Her team arenâ€™t so charitable and start lobbing blame pie in Michelleâ€™s unimpressed face.     9.36pm BST   The market team from Nebula are immediately on the chopping block for selling stuff too cheap (Alanaâ€™s fault?) and for spending too much time with the expert who they then ignored.     9.36pm BST   Alan says Nebula is â€œtoxic gas in spaceâ€. Aleksandra feebly tries to correct him but he doesnâ€™t care and she should know that.     9.35pm BST   I havenâ€™t even breathed or sipped my drink and weâ€™re already in the boardroom. Iâ€™d forgotten how much of the show they spin this section out for. Almost half the show.     9.34pm BST   I just love the sooooooooound of money, hollers Karthick. Iâ€™m sorry, but in my mind palace he will forever be sat in the back of a Renault 5, puking into a paper bag.     9.33pm BST   I could actually do with that plant stand to put my phone on. No seriously, which shop did the girls sell that to?     9.33pm BST   The girls go into full bullshit mode as they try to sell anything and everything. Trishna is raging as Jessica (The Mask) sells something too easily when she claims sheâ€™d have made a ton on it.     9.32pm BST   A tenner says he comes out with â€œBow ties are cool,â€ before the end of his time on the show. Twenty!     9.31pm BST   Seriously, Mukaiâ€™s matching pocket kerchief is the last straw. He seems like a nice guy but heâ€™s asking to get bog-washed by the rest of his team before the end of episode one.     9.30pm BST   The girls stumble around the cobbles of Camden Lock shouting into their horizontal smart phones as Claude derides their lack of common sense and business sense. Has he met an Apprentice candidate before? The ones with common sense are screened out at the first interview.     9.29pm BST   Is that Mukai wearing the insane orange crochet bowtie? Who does he think he is? Zandra Rhodes? This is the Apprentice, not the Clothes Show, Mukai.     9.28pm BST   Two straw-haired ladies banter about how much to charge for stuff. Oh it was Alana and Rebecca. These people will be like old friends in a few short weeks. But right now they are shapes, like that episode of Black Mirror where you canâ€™t see someoneâ€™s face because theyâ€™ve real-time blocked you. Just shapes.     9.27pm BST   The girls make their scheduled stop while their uninformed van driver arrives in Camden. With all of their stuff. Who was in charge of logistics? WHO?     9.26pm BST   Karrrrren despairs from behind her smoked glass eye protectors as he loses the sale. Back at the car boot, tut covers the table, unsold. Titans decide Portobello is the place to be if they want to knock out the remaining junk to unsuspecting poshoes with more money than sense.     9.25pm BST   The boys are polishing their Alan Partridge chair and Oliver (posh) pushes the sale by telling the dealer â€œIâ€™ve actually got a sofa myselfâ€. Thatâ€™s the kind of expertise money canâ€™t buy. I want Oliver to sit me down and tell me ALL about sofas.     9.24pm BST   Jessica love bombs an antiques dealer and tells him she will bring him her wares on their way to Camden. He has little option but to accept. YAY, she says on the phone to him as he hangs up, terrified.     9.23pm BST   Michelle, having spent 8 hours quizzing her expert, pulls a Michael Gove and ignores him completely, opting to eschew his Portobello hint and driving to Camden. A place where the only things you can buy are patchouli, Doc Martens and ethnic throws. Super.     9.22pm BST   Oliver sounds quite posh, doesnâ€™t he? More observations like that to come. The girls are still quizzing their expert while Claude looks at his watch, wondering when theyâ€™re going to start selling the stuff.     9.21pm BST   The upscale faction of Team Titans go to Chelsea to tout an old drinks trolley they should obviously be strewing in bunting and chilli lights and flogging to a Hoxton minty with a bulging wallet. Fail.     9.20pm BST   Karrren watches the boys through her aviators. Sheâ€™s impressed.     9.20pm BST   Paul looks at the Alan Partridge chair and gets a Â£300 valuation from his expert. He thinks hipsters will like it. Add a couple of antique trombone parts and an ironic lampshade and youâ€™ve got a deal. The girls sell the same chair for about 50p. Go girls!     9.19pm BST   Itâ€™s already mid-morning. How time flies in Alan world. Both teams meet with experts to find out how much the good stuff is worth. Little do the girls know that the whole boysâ€™ team is hiding inside that tiny, blue wooden horse.     9.18pm BST   At the car boot sale, the boys set out their tatty old trestle table with broken china and an old statuette. The girls havenâ€™t even unpacked when some eager beavers with an eye for a bargain start taking them for a ride, I mean buying their stuff. They have no idea what theyâ€™re flogging and ask for some magic beans in exchange for a Rembrandt.     9.16pm BST   Jessica almost dropped a vase! Did you see! But she was pretending which is definitely a quality Lord Sugar is looking for. Choice dummy drop skillz, Jess. Youâ€™re hired! Only joking.     9.16pm BST   Jessica wisecracks her from boardroom to people carrier to stock room. She never stops. She loves a laff. We all love a laff donâ€™t we? Cos itâ€™s a laff!     9.15pm BST   Alana or one of the others who looks a bit similar says sheâ€™s happy to play market trader and knock tut out for tuppence. At this stage, the girls all look the same and so do the boys. Except for Dillon who looks ASTONISHING.     9.14pm BST   Michele decides to mark everything down whether itâ€™s Ming or minging. She doesnâ€™t care what itâ€™s worth, knock it out for a fiver.     9.13pm BST   Literally not a single girl wants to step up and manage Nebula. Michele bores everyone senseless with her mortgage managing experience and meekly accepts the PM mantle before boasting about how much of a threat she is. Yuh.     9.12pm BST   Titans choose their project manager and the first lamb to the slaughter is Paul who has seen Bargain Hunt and has GOT THIS.     9.12pm BST   The boys go straight for Team Titans. The girls are pondering Nebula. Aleksandra says itâ€™s something to do with stars and goes into full Brian Cox on a mountain top paroxysms of cosmic joy. So they agree to shut her up.     9.11pm BST   So, to recap the first 10 minutes. Boardroom face, Jessica hysterical, Karrren menacing. They see their luxury house. Some squealing. And straight into boys v girls. Team naming!     9.10pm BST   I take it weâ€™ve all taken Jessica to our hearts. Sheâ€™s the only one whose name I can remember. Today is all about taking names and then forgetting them again. Sheâ€™s the female Jim Carey.      9.08pm BST   Sorry about the late start! Tech problems. Right, letâ€™s start.     9.07pm BST   As Bake Off heads towards its conclusion, here comes its evil twin, The Apprentice, upturning bun-covered tables and kicking out the guy ropes of the tent as it goes.  We now live in a world where the boss of The Apprentice (US version) can actually run for leader of the free world. Think about that for a minute - Lord Sugar as Prime Minister. It could happen. So it is our duty to watch the heck out of this series so the daft ayputh doesnâ€™t get any ideas. We shall distract him with 18 hepped-up business lemmings, desperate for his Â£250,000 and a kind look from his furry face. Thereâ€™s 12 weeks of competition with 18 contestants, so expect some multiple firings and general backstabbing. Weâ€™ll be liveblogging each weekâ€™s action, so do join us and share your observations in the comments below. Is this thing on? Itâ€™s business time. At 9pm. So join me here then.  ",1
"With lifesize replicas of Buckingham Palace, a rampaging elephant, about 7,000 costumes and a Â£100m budget, The Crown is one of the most lavish television dramas ever made. The two-series biopic, starting with the wedding of the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and written by Peter Morgan (the writer of the film The Queen), charts Britain in the second half of the 20th century. But it will not be airing on the BBC; instead it is appearing on the subscription service Netflix from Friday 4 November.  Stephen Daldry, its director, said: â€œItâ€™s not just the story of the royal family. Itâ€™s the story of who we are and why weâ€™re here and what we dream of. Itâ€™s the story about a nation.â€ The drama stars Claire Foy as the young Queen and Matt Smith, the former Doctor Who actor, as Prince Philip. â€œWhen itâ€™s about the royal family, it probably helps to have good tailoring and a lot of extras. They did have a lot of people around them and you couldnâ€™t make it on the cheap,â€ observed Smith, who relies on a blond wig to make him look the part. â€œWigs cost a lot of money.â€   Related: Royal drama The Crown shows Queen's father reciting dirty limerick     Netflix has been best known for US commissions such as House of Cards and Stranger Things, but its move into British costume drama demonstrates the changing nature of the television industry where the BBC faces increasing competition from better resourced and more nimble international rivals. With a running cost of around Â£5m an hour, the Crown compares with films such as The Kingâ€™s Speech rather than the typical Â£1m-per-episode drama budget at the BBC or ITV. To make The Night Manager for the BBC, the producer had to solicit money from co-production partners AMC. Danny Cohen, the BBCâ€™s then head of television, has admitted that the corporation â€œcouldnâ€™t compete with the amount of money that Netflix were prepared to payâ€ for â€œa classic BBC subjectâ€. Netflix, by contrast, committed to spending a Â£100m budget within 40 minutes of sitting down to discuss the drama. Keen for half of all its global content to be original, Netflix has not only snapped up The Crown but has also bought the cult comedy hit Black Mirror from Channel 4. Meanwhile, its rival, Amazon, will launch the Grand Tour later in November, the Â£160m Jeremy Clarkson vehicle as the two aim to develop a new market in cut-price subscription television.      Netflix commissioned two series initially â€“ a commitment that Morgan said â€œtook us back a bitâ€. The series currently being filmed ends in the 1960s and Daldry has said he is â€œassuming we will carry onâ€, with each new series set to cover a decade potentially up to the Queenâ€™s 90th. The economies of scale from a two-series commitment meant replicas sets could be built and the directors were able to add to the much-lauded â€œauthenticityâ€. The production includes a vintage train costing Â£200,000 and filming on location at Ely Cathedral. Bringing the story up to date may yet prove more complicated for other reasons. When dealing with the royal family, a senior BBC executive still acts as royal liaison officer to request footage or interviews for corporation use. Meanwhile, in The Crown, King George VI is portrayed reciting a limerick on the morning of his daughterâ€™s wedding that includes the word â€œcuntâ€.    Peter Morgan (left) and Stephen Daldry, writer and director of The Crown. Photograph: David Benett/Getty   But Morgan â€“ who has successfully dramatised the period around the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 in The Queen â€“ said at a screening of the first episode last week that he had kept his distance from the Palace, even declining an opportunity to meet the Queen, while the Palaceâ€™s line is that the programme is simply â€œa fictional dramaâ€. If the programme is recommissioned, a greater challenge is to predict how viewing habits are changing. Morgan said he found it harder to predict how the global television revolution itself would play out, as the lines blur between handheld screens and cinemas. â€œThe way in which we will be watching this a few years down the line ... itâ€™s almost as though Iâ€™m too unimaginative to predict,â€ he said. â€œEven if I do continue with this, we will be watching it in different way.â€ The Poldark prince? Promotional shots of Matt Smith rowing topless have already prompted tabloid comparisons with Aiden Turner, the star of Poldark on BBC1, although the actor himself is not so convinced. The portrayal of Philip as a young Royal navy lieutenant in a rowing race on the Mediterranean had prompted the Mail on Sunday to declare, â€œItâ€™s Philip the Poldark prince!â€ â€œItâ€™s definitely not,â€ Smith said, when asked if it was a â€œPoldark momentâ€. â€œIâ€™m not in the same shape as Aiden. Hell no! But I think you do see my bottom at one point.â€",1
"RIO DE JANEIRO â€” The Trump Organization says it is pulling out of a troubled hotel project in Rio de Janeiro, just weeks after a federal prosecutor opened a criminal investigation that included the hotel and another Trump venture in the city.The prosecutor is looking into a broad range of investments across Brazil, questioning whether public pension fund managers in the country were paid bribes to invest money in commercial projects.The criminal inquiry names both the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro and a Trump Towers project in the city. But many other investments that have nothing to do with President-elect Donald J. Trump or his organization are also being investigated, including Brazilian real estate, energy and manufacturing ventures.A spokeswoman for Trump Hotels said in a statement that the decision to pull out of the Rio hotel project was made because of problems in completing the 13-story, 171-room luxury property. It was opened for the Rio Olympics in August before several floors and facilities were finished, including a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.â€œUnfortunately, the developers of the Rio de Janeiro hotel are significantly behind on the completion of the property, and their vision for the hotel no longer aligns with the Trump Hotels brand,â€ said Jennifer Rodstrom, the spokeswoman for Trump Hotels.Ms. Rodstrom did not immediately respond to a question about whether the decision was made in response to the criminal investigation. The hotel uses the Trump name, and the Trump Organization has been managing the property. But it does not have an equity stake in the hotel, which is owned by LSH Barra, a Brazilian company based in Rio. The move by Trump Hotels to stop managing the hotel was first reported by The Washington Post.Mr. Trumpâ€™s business dealings have come under intense scrutiny in countries around the world. In Turkey, India, Argentina, Scotland, the Philippines and other nations, Mr. Trumpâ€™s ventures have raised questions and concerns, particularly over potential conflicts of interest that could arise between his business activities and his role as president.In the United States, one federal agency, the Office of Government Ethics, has said that Mr. Trump must divest from his properties to eliminate potential conflicts.On Wednesday, House Democrats issued a letter suggesting that the General Services Administration â€” which essentially serves as the landlord for the federal government â€” had concluded that Mr. Trump would breach the lease that his company has to operate a hotel in a federally-owned building on Pennsylvania Avenue the moment he is sworn in.The Democrats said that the agencyâ€™s deputy commissioner had made this statement in a briefing to House staff members earlier this month, citing a provision in the 60-year lease with the Trump Organization that prohibits it from being held by any federal government employee.But shortly after the Democrats issued their letter on Wednesday, the agency said that it had not yet reached such a conclusion.â€œWe can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,â€ a spokeswoman for the agency, Ashley Nash-Hahn, said in a statement.A decision on this question, she added, will not likely come until Mr. Trump takes office.The hotel project was conceived by Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a right-wing businessman who said that he gained Mr. Trumpâ€™s interest in managing the property by boasting of family ties: Mr. Figueiredo Filho is the grandson of JoÃ£o Figueiredo, the last military dictator in an authoritarian government that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985.Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a federal prosecutor in the capital, BrasÃ­lia, opened the criminal inquiry in October, identifying $40 million in investments in the hotel made by two small Brazilian pension funds. One invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm; the other manages the pensions for civil servants in Tocantins State.In legal filings, Mr. Lopes said that he was examining why the two pension funds invested so much of their capital in the venture, positioning his inquiry within a broader federal investigation of graft at Brazilâ€™s pension funds, pillars of the economy that have been involved in an array of scandals in recent years.As part of the same investigation, Mr. Lopes is also focusing on the Trump Towers Rio, a project to build five futuristic office towers in downtown Rio that was announced in 2012 in conjunction with MRP, a Bulgarian real estate company. Unlike the Trump Hotel Rio, the partners in the downtown venture have not started construction.Mr. Lopes is examining whether the Trump Organization and MRP illegally benefited from support for the office-tower complex from a huge public bank, Caixa EconÃ´mica Federal.LSH Barra, the owner of the Trump Hotel Rio, did not respond to requests to comment on the decision by the Trump Organization to pull out of the venture. In a recent statement, LSH said that it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the pension fund investments, and that it was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.Mr. Figueiredo Filho, who spearheaded the venture until recently, is now living in the United States.In a statement, he said he found out about the split with the Trump Organization on Tuesday, adding that he respected the decision and currently did not take part in management decisions for the hotel.â€œMy admiration for Donald Trump, with whom I share so many ideas and whom I enthusiastically supported during the campaign, has not changed one millimeter,â€ said Mr. Figueiredo Filho.It remains unclear what will happen to the hotel, which was conceived as a linchpin of Rioâ€™s overhaul for the Olympics. Parts of the futuristic beachfront property, which was the Trump Hotel Collectionâ€™s first property in South America, still resemble a construction site, despite the hotelâ€™s inauguration months ago.",1
"Was Scalia murdered? Forget Conspiracy Theory. This is Real.By Jon Rappoport As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia. You have a Supreme Court Justice who died, not in attendance of a physician. You have a non-homicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed. You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack. What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction? Why not a cerebral hemorrhage? How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack Did the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas. If this isnt enough, the Post goes on: Scalias physician, Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalias [prior] health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland. Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject, he said. When asked whether he planned to make public the statement hes preparing for [Texas Judge] Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter. As long as no law-enforcement investigation of Scalias death is launched, the doctor is justified. Confidentiality applies, unless Scalias family lifts it. But if such an investigation is opened, all bets are off. Confidentiality no longer applies. There are reports that, after Scalias body was transported from the celebrity ranch in Texas, closely guarded and shielded by a bevy of marshals, it was rapidly embalmed. If so, that would apparently make toxicological tests far more difficult or impossible. As for a murder motive, try: upsetting the voting balance of the US Supreme Court. Try: a push to appoint a new Justice now, thus ensuring the appointees political persuasion, regardless of the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election. Try: attempting to shift the Courts voting balance in upcoming cases on abortion, immigration, and Obamacare. Dismiss the comfortable notion that this couldnt happen. JFK couldnt have been murdered, but he was. High political figures dont carry special immunity. Dismiss assurances from incompetents in Texas that Scalia died of natural causes, and dismiss the press repeating these assuranceswhich add up to: nothing. Dismiss calls for propriety in a time of grief. Dismiss whatever opinions, pro and con, circulate now about Scalia, his points of view, his decisions, his character, his life. Theyre irrelevant to the facts of his death. Those facts are as clear as mud. Dismiss the typical accusations of conspiracy theory. Its no theory when key facts are unknown and incompetents supplied the current information. In addition to what Ive cited above, count as relevant the fact that Scalias federal protection had been removed while he was at the Texas ranch. Were told Scalia didnt want that protection. Maybe yes, maybe no. Were also told Scalias family didnt want an autopsy. Again, maybe yes, maybe no. The family has been silent. Or if not, their statements arent being reported. Consider, as potentially relevant, the report that Scalia was found with a pillow over his head. Consider, as relevant, that Judge Guevara, deciding without seeing the body that Scalia died from natural causes, ruled against doing an autopsyand a counter-opinion, offered unofficially by another Texas judge, Bishop, that she would have wanted an autopsy. Concerning Judge Guevara, this may or may not be relevantheavy.com reports, Judge Cinderela Guevara: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know: This isnt the first time Guevara has been the source of controversy. In 2013, Melaney Parker Rayburn was found dead after being hit by a train in Marfa, Texas Liz Parker, Melaneys mom, questioned how Guevara handled the investigation of her daughters death, The Daily Kos reported. Melaney was hit by a Union Pacific Railroad train and, Liz [her mother] wrote, a Union Pacific representative told her that it appeared that her body had been placed on the tracks while she was unconscious. Liz asked the Justice of the Peace and the Sheriff to open the case as a homicide investigation, but they would not. Guevara, who was a Justice of the Peace at the time, did not order a rape kit or an autopsy, Liz wrote, because a doctor at the scene said the cause of death was obvious. Liz later wrote a letter to the editor, published on Big Bend Now, in which she said that Guevara had asked for God to give her an answer about whether Melaneys death was suicide. Liz wrote that Guevara told her: Yes, this was a tragedy, but the true tragedy was that she died without accepting Jesus Christ as her savior. Bottom line so far: Any reasonable law-enforcement agency would immediately open an investigation into Scalias death. Failing to do so would rate as aiding and abetting a concealment of the truth, whatever that turns out to be. (To read about Jons mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix, click here.)

About a bajillion Supreme Court opinions, for starters. Recorded interviews, for another. If youre trying to be funny, you have not succeeded. We know his signature lived anyway. He was killed by Illuminati Bilderberg Zionists! Or maybe from too much fluoride in the tap water and chemtrails!! lol Go away underage troll. Can we beam you up now, Scottie? Good article. I hate to think that he was murdered, but theres enough things that dont add up that we have to consider that possibility. I find it suspicious that he died while a guest at a ranch, that there was no autopsy, and that the body was rapidly embalmed. I am sure there are methods of causing death that can make it look like natural causes. If the CIA had Secret Poison Dart Heart Attack Guns in the 70s, what do you suspect theyd have access to 40 years later given that military technology doesnt have the constraints as civilian tech? I bet they have frequency weapons today that at the very least could cause heart havoc. Totally non invasive and therefor undetectable. Ranch has its OWN AIRSTRIP w/ many high profile VIPs there. Why wasnt he FLOWN to metro area immediately and professionally examined? As an ACTIVE high govt official- not retired- the needs of public supercede his family desire for secrecy. Same guy. He was found guilty of five felony counts, later reversed on appeal, which means he owes someone big time. After Iran Contra he was rewarded for his role by being appointed a honcho at DARPA, a well-known black ops division of the military. He was also head of NSA. Who would suspect him of anything shady? LOL Youd think a smart guy like a SCOTUS judge would know better. No, not the same guy, just the same name (well, not exactly, see below). John Marian Poindexter of Iran-Contra fame, was employed by Ronald Reagan as his National Security Advisor. The ranch-owning John B. Poindexter is a registered Democrat. Hmmmm. Very interesting. While political affiliations can easily change, the middle initial usually doesnt, although the name coincidence is very strange. Thanks. no autopsy was ordered via his Familys wishes- he has high BP and heart problems and too weak for surgery- this via his DR and his family! I don;t know where you get your information, but the family has no say in the matter. Every State I know of, Texas included, has mandatory autopsy laws when people are found dead for no apparent reason. Secondly, I heard the exact opposite, he was in great health for a man his age. He didnt smoke or drink and got plenty of exercise. Toxic land.violate hippa laws much? Or are u guessing? no idiot- I read what the family had to say DUH I feel for his family, but the Country is BETTER OFF W/OUT this Grandstanding member of the Court gone. The Guy with the Pirates of Penzance stripes on his Robe, as if he was more special then the rest of the Court? Not so special now! To his family, my condolences. As an American, there really is a God! To bad Scalia wont be with God. He knows, based upon his service to Country record. Guess, he will feel the Bern! You rear you ugly head again and also speak ill of the dead. Scalia was the most original intent constitutional member of the court, although that is not saying much. But, I realize you wouldnt recognize a Constitutional principle if it bit you on the a$$. Didnt speak ill of anyone. Just expressed my thoughts about a horrible person whos Family I feel empathy for. But, none for you or scalia. Eightball who made you lord of the Board? He took his Constitutional principals and okd Citizens United. Condi is that you? You might want to look up the definition of empathy. While youre at that, you might do some research on why SCOTUS stood they way they did on the Citizens United case. The sad, little-known fact is that all the natural born citizens of the United States are corporate entities, therefore the court had to rule that the corporations have the same rights as citizens. Im not saying they were right, only that decision was a huge nugget of truth to all incorporated citizens who bothered to look at the case law. No need to look up Citizens United, just follow the MONEY in this Election! I suppose you think TTP is great too! I will look at results of CU, its pretty easy to see they favor the rich. Koch Bro.s is this you? No, its John Poindexter and Michael Bloomberg. The Country is better off without Scalia and Pirate stripes. The Left favors GE , Viacom, Time Warner and an entire hosts of very wealthy Corporations. And? What Left? Democrat ran companies. You know what I meant! Many Democrats are misinformed about the evil corporations that they wrongfully believe are ran by Republicans. The most heinous companies are ran by Democrats. The Union pension plans, Fidelity and Vanguard ,20% of those Democrat ran mutual funds go to the funding of private prisons. Private prisons which make Democrats a huge profit. You can easily find out the names of the managers/owners of these mutual funds. GE, Viacom and the rest are cronies of Obama. BLueDogs dont count. Democrats are The Leftists in this country, am I wrong about this? Left or Right.. About as different as Muslim Burka and Judeo-Christian Nun outfit. None! Just names are changed. I agree that he made some bad decisions, however, he was the best friend the Constitution had on the court which is not saying much. What are you doing on this site anyway? Shouldnt you be over at commmunism today or some such far left radical webpage that is more aligned with your pyschosis? You sure believe in freedom of speech dont you? See, people like you are why Scalias death is good for the country. Enjoy your new Amerika ahole. When ALL your freedom and liberty is stripped from you and your family by the Bern who is 79yrs OLD, you can pat your ignorant, disrespectful loser self on the back. Ari Fliescher is that you? Bush Family apologist. I think you have been watching too much Pirates of penzance! Burn!!!! We will indeed enjoy our restored America when our country is given back to us from the oligarchs plutocrats, and jobs are kept here while the deadbeat corporate fatcats are forced to pay their share and even the lives undeserving blowhards like you are improved, well all light one up and toss a cold one back in honor of the 73 YEAR OLD STATESMAN that helped bring it about. (You didnt even get his age right dimwit). All hail the Soviet! So why did they slaughter the Romanovs, even the children? How many children have you assassinated? You better check your meds. Someone put in a hallucinogen Dilbert! ah gee. Randje. looks like you socialist pal Bernie wont be able to continue to take America from those big meannie corporations and the Koch brothers Hes tanking against the Shrillary! You love Socialism which makes you the King of dimwits! Thats the best you got genius? You dont know socialism from pederasty. Which is why you walk funny. Just sayin . dimwit ..! Was he murdered? Of course he was. Do you think the pillow found over his head was anything but a message? It would have been much more titillating if he had been found tied up with one of those sexual choking harness things (happy to admit I dont even know what they are called) but well all have to make do with pillow over head because the message has to be clear for all to see. particularly the rest of the members of SCOTUS: You have been silenced. Hard to miss that one. Ha, its OK to say Ball Gag, maybe not OK to wear one but hey, to each his or her own Pillow over the face is definitely a Ginsberg era tactic, good call, no need to hit them with something to Sci-fi, it might not have the impact! Thats what I thought, a calling card with the message, we shut him upand his opinions. It is pretty hard to smother oneself to death with a pillow! Crying in ones pillow is probably the most extreme pillow related scenario I can think of. LOLhaving a fit is more like it!! Lol. I believe Scalia was murdered! Nothing to see here, sheep. Go back to sleep. Bleep. Bleeeeeeeeep. an autopsy should have been done irregardless of his condition.someone that important will be speculated about if no autopsy.and for good reason IRREGARDLESS AINT A WORD. Hey it the Thought Police! Wanna donut? lulz HE WAS MURDERED. ACCEPT IT. THE U.S. ETHICS ARE IN TH TOILET WERE THE TURDS ALL U.S. ALLIES HAVE BECOME UNDEMOCRATIC STATES IN THE PROCESS OF HELPING THE U.S.. MURDER NATION STATE LEADERS, THEN PLUNDER THE NATIONS. Give us a break with the caps willya? Give us a break with the brown and black states, as well. Those countries own leaders murder the citizens and have for centuries. Not just one, but millions. Cinderela Sounds like it could be a CIA groomed drug trafficking operative name to me. Shes too stupidbelieve me I wouldnt accuse anyone in government positions of being intelligent now. Nepotism reigns in government, as well as in corporations. Suspiciousall the way around. A professional hit leaving his pillow over his head to send a message to others. From the facts I read and heard about Scalias death , I find too many holes in this report. It would merit a thorough investigation. Further, what was the rush to judgement to dispose Scalias body before it was thoroughly examined. This all seems very suspicious to me. Talk about a stacked deck in the making. I care not who a nations politicians are, as long as I control the money supply to paraphrase Lord Rottenchild Immigration, gun rights, campaign finance, health care, affirmative action, homosexual rights and abortionall in the hands of the few rulers that Scalia warned us against. people who die of a heart attack dont have pillows over their head, dont lie peacefully fully dressed in a SUIT. he was at a dude ranch and just came back from dinner; doubt that he was wearing a SUIT at dinner. people evacuate their bowels and bladder upon death and hear attack victims usually foam at mouth, grab chest, flail for air. NOT RESTING PEACEFULLY !!! Justice Scalia could have been found hanging upside down from a tree and shot six times in the back and Judge Guevara would have said it was the clearest case of a heart attack shed ever seen. I dont know if its true, but Ive heard that Scalia was cremated. In the cases of official murder, there is usually a very quick determination of death. Other indications include no autopsy, no photos of the body, quick burial or cremation of the body and ridicule, disappearance or sudden death of those who are close to the murder and who question it. Look at Pope John Paul I, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, etc. One of the biggies is if there are no photos or if the photos were lost somehow. No access to the body is another. A Navy doctor in Bethesda who questioned the photos he had just examined of JFK, and who said they looked altered, was found days later shot in the head, the pistol in his right hand. But he was very left handed. Unfortunately, the doctor had been telling people that he thought JFK had been shot from the front, not the back as the official report said. Vince Fosters family played ball and lied about Fosters gun, changing the story to match the official report on that death. So families quite often help investigatorsor else. He made that comment regarding the lesser universities due to the high percentage of Blacks failing out when given affirmatiuve action scholarships to more prestigious Universities. Also, because he was a Catholic only balanced out the numbers. Do you think a fair method of appointing The Supreme Judges would be to make sure that they were all Leftists? And it will continue to be stacked that way for a long time. If Bathhouse Barry wanted scalia out of the way, should of done it in his first term, not on his way out. ",0
"But although prices have risen domestically and abroad, analysts said fears of empty supermarket shelves are overblown and that the gloomy outlook of big food companies is really part of a larger effort to pressure the government into dismantling sugar trade barriers. The futures price of sugar traded on world markets closed at 22.2 cents a pound Thursday, down about a penny from the previous day but still up 72 percent in six months. Weather problems in the sugar producing regions of India, the diversion of Brazilian sugar cane to produce ethanol and a growing global sweet tooth are behind the increase, according to analysts. In a recent letter to Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack, the group warned of 'unprecedented shortages.' Without higher quotas on sugar imports, 'consumers will pay higher prices, food manufacturing jobs will be at risk and trading patterns will be distorted,' the food companies said. There is considerable debate about whether the run up in sugar prices is a sign of a looming crisis. Just a fraction of global sugar supplies are traded on international markets. And according to the USDA, the wholesale price of sugar in the United States has risen by a much smaller amount, just 15 percent from a year ago to a little under 35 cents a pound. 'I do not think there will be a severe sugar shortage for U.S. food manufacturers in the near future,' said Tom Graves, a Standard & Poor's equity analyst who follows the big food companies. Graves said the warning by the food companies was more about the politics of sugar quotas than price spikes or shortages. With the exception of Mexico, which the North American Free Trade Agreement freed from quotas, U.S. trading partners are limited to exporting more than a combined 1.3 million metric tons of sugar to the United States this year. Mexico will account for roughly the same amount of U.S. sugar imports. The United States consumes about 10 million metric tons, according to the American Sugar Alliance, the trade group that represents domestic sugar farmers. Food companies have argued that raising the quotas will increase supply and drive down prices. Sugar producers vigorously have defended any attempts to change the rules, claiming that increased quotas could at some point push prices below the cost of production and drive them out of business. The USDA is staying out of the battle for now. Spokesman Justin DeJong said the agency will 'continue to monitor market developments.' Some of the biggest names in domestic food production including Hershey Co., Kraft Foods, Mars Inc. and Unilever United States Inc., are part of the coalition seeking higher quotas. But all four companies refused to answer questions about sugar quotas, prices and supplies when called by the Los Angeles Times. While sugar supplies are tighter than in previous years, which accounts for rising prices, the nation is far from a sugar crisis, Graves said. Supermarkets report plentiful supplies -- as well as price increases. The wholesale price San Bernardino, Calif., supermarket chain Stater Bros. pays for sugar rose 10 percent this week, according the Jack Brown, chief executive of the large regional grocery chain. Stater Bros. does not intend to pass the entire increase through to consumers, he said. A five-pound bag of Stater Bros sugar sells for $2.69, or just under 54 cents a pound. The dire warnings of the food manufacturers were mocked Thursday by the American Sugar Alliance. Sugar producers are unaware of a single buyer having problems finding the commodity, said Phillip Hayes, an Alliance spokesman. The group posted a notice on its Web site asking 'any large food manufacturers claiming sugar shortages' to contact Jack Roney, an executive at the Alliance, and included his phone number. 'Every sugar producer in America has sugar available to sell,' the group said, 'and the American Sugar Alliance can provide contact information for numerous suppliers.' ",1
"copyright 2009, The Washington Post WASHINGTON -- With President Obama poised to give a health-care address Wednesday before a joint session of Congress, administration officials promised that he will deliver a detailed prescription for reform despite the risks of spelling out exactly where he stands. Vice President Joe Biden, in an appearance in Washington on Thursday, said the speech will map out 'in understandable, clear terms what our administration wants to happen with regard to health care, and what we are going to push for specifically.' Though favoring one proposal over another carries political risks, potentially limiting what Obama might be able to claim as a victory, senior administration officials said the speech will satisfy demands that he clarify which provisions he supports and which he could jettison. The contents of the speech are largely decided, officials said. 'I don't think that there will be any ambiguity about where he thinks we have to go from here,' senior adviser David Axelrod said. Joel Benenson, the lead pollster for Obama, said in a memo to Democrats on Capitol Hill that support for a health-care overhaul is higher than it appears and will increase once the specifics are made clear. 'There is little doubt that the moderate numbers of support for the president's health insurance reform plan are based in large part on a lack of awareness of the details of the plan,' Benenson wrote. Officials would not elaborate on what Obama will say -- namely, whether he will continue to advocate for a government-run insurance program. But advisers said Obama will address the question -- setting the stage for a showdown between liberal Democrats insistent on a public option and conservative Democrats and Republicans who oppose it. In the Senate Finance Committee, where negotiations on a bipartisan compromise are underway and a conference call is scheduled for Friday, lawmakers are trying to reach a deal by Sept. 15 with perhaps as many as three Republicans on board. The White House is focused on one of the three, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who they view as the Republican most willing to reach an agreement with the White House. On Thursday, aides to Snowe confirmed that the senator is talking with administration officials, particularly with regard to her 'safety-net fallback option.' Under that proposal, the government would sponsor a nonprofit insurance plan but it would become available only in states or regions where private insurance firms had failed to offer a reasonably priced product that would be affordable to 95 percent of the population. Snowe's spokeswoman, Julia Wanzco, said the senator 'has had an open line of communication with the White House over the course of the past few months.' Meanwhile, pressure from liberals is mounting. In a statement Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called a public option essential to real reform and said not including one would be 'a major victory' for the insurance industry.' In a letter delivered to the White House on Thursday, the two leaders of the bloc of House progressives told Obama they will not support a health-care plan without a public option -- and demanded a meeting to inform him face to face. 'Any bill that does not provide, at a minimum, a public option built on the Medicare provider system and with reimbursement based on Medicare rates -- not negotiated rates -- is unacceptable,' said the letter, signed by Reps. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., and Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. 'A health reform bill without a robust public option will not achieve the health reform this country so desperately needs,' it continued. 'We cannot vote for anything less.' Also Thursday, two major liberal advocacy groups, MoveOn.org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, launched petition drives demanding that Obama endorse a public insurance option. Should Obama abandon the public option, progressives will come under tremendous pressure to back the plan anyway. White House advisers are confident that Democrats across the spectrum will be reluctant to block even a health-care plan that they think falls short, but the advisers said they recognize that the president must work to keep the party base satisfied if he embraces a more modest plan. Biden, in his appearance, predicted the administration is 'going to get something substantial' once the negotiations are complete. 'It's going to be an awful lot of screaming and hollering before we get there, but I believe we're going to get there,' Biden said. 'The president's going to lay out for you very clearly on Wednesday what he thinks those pieces have to be and will be. But that's as much as I should say, and the president will tell you a lot more on Wednesday.' Staff writers Ben Pershing, Michael D. Shear, Dan Eggen, Lori Montgomery and Mike Fletcher contributed.

"The Queenâ€™s Dartmouth has run second in the prestigious Canadian International, coming close to giving the monarch a rare Group One victory overseas. The race was won by the 12-1 shot Erupt, trained in France, who had finished behind Dartmouth at Ascot in July. Dartmouth was one of the slowest from the stalls as the-mile-and-a-half contest began on Sunday evening but was immediately urged forward by William Buick, riding him for the first time. That proved an astute move as the early pace was sustainable and several horses held up at the rear in the early stages, including the Ryan Moore-ridden Idaho, failed to get involved later. Dartmouth tracked the early leader, World Approval, and must have provoked excitement among his connections when moving to the fore at the top of the straight. But his tenure there was brief as Erupt swept by under StÃ©phane Pasquier, holding on to win by a comfortable length. Dartmouth ran on well to be second ahead of the US-trained Wake Forest and The Pizza Man. Idaho, representing the Irish trainer Aidan Oâ€™Brien, was fifth. This is the seventh consecutive year that the International has been won by a European raider, Francis-Henri Graffard being the successful trainer this time. It has been a productive year for Dartmouth, who began with successes in two Group Threes and a Group Two. He was a respectable third in Ascotâ€™s King George on his first attempt at the highest level and his showing in Canada suggests he may be able to find an opportunity in a Group One. He is now quoted at 14-1 for the Breedersâ€™ Cup Turf in California on 5 November.",1
"AntiLiberals like to pretend that they are open-minded people who welcome everyone with open arms. With violent riots protesting a Trump president and despicable actions toward leaders like Vice President-Elect Mike Pence, their actions are telling a very different story. Earlier this week, Mike Pence went to see the Broadway show Hamilton. The actors decided to take the opportunity to humiliate hima move that has had a significant impact on their success. Video captured the Vice President-elect being greeted with a mix of cheers and boos as he entered and exited the show. In between, he received a lecture from Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the musical. Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here at Hamilton: An American Musical. We really do, Dixon, who also asked the crowd not to boo Pence, said. We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Thank you.

"The future of Americaâ€™s basic environmental protection has been thrown into doubt, with a host of fossil fuel executives and climate change skeptics set to get key roles in Donald Trumpâ€™s new administration, including a potential return to political life for Sarah Palin. Palin, the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential nominee, is thought to be in the running to become interior secretary in a Trump presidency. The move would put Palin, a vocal proponent of oil and gas drilling, in charge of Americaâ€™s public lands, including prized national parks such as Yosemite, Yellowstone and the Everglades.   Related: Donald Trump presidency a 'disaster for the planet', warn climate scientists   Forrest Lucas, co-founder of oil products firm Lucas Oil, is also reported to be in the running for the interior secretary job. Palin has previously voiced her interest in heading the Department of Energy, if only to dismantle it, and said last year that gas and oil are â€œthings that God has dumped on this part of the Earth for mankindâ€™s use instead of us relying on unkind foreign nations for us to import their resourcesâ€. The future of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also appears uncertain, with Trump appointing Myron Ebell to head the transition team for the regulator. Ebell is a director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative thinktank, and has expressed doubts over the reality of what he calls â€œglobal warming alarmismâ€. In April, Trump said he wanted to completely abolish the EPA, which he erroneously called â€œthe department of environmentalâ€, and told Fox News that it was â€œkilling us environmentally, itâ€™s just killing our businessesâ€. The EPA was created in 1970 under Richard Nixonâ€™s administration and is responsible for the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, which have both come under attack from Republican lawmakers in recent years. Trump has since modified his stance on the EPA, stressing that he supports clean air and â€œcrystal clear, crystal cleanâ€ water but not programs that combat climate change.    Related: 100 years of Americaâ€™s national parks â€“ in pictures   â€œI will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans,â€ Trump said in September. â€œI believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.â€ The Sierra Club, Americaâ€™s largest environmental group, was quick to criticize the makeup of Trumpâ€™s transition team and warned that any attempt to unwind the EPA or environmental laws will be fiercely resisted. â€œMyron Ebell is the sort of insider fighting progress that Trump supposedly campaigned against. Heâ€™s not qualified to run the transition team,â€ said John Coequyt, director of federal climate campaigning at the Sierra Club. â€œItâ€™s not clear what Trump wants to do but itâ€™s likely theyâ€™ll drop the Clean Power Plan, defund the EPA and take potshots at the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act.  â€œI donâ€™t think the Senate and House Republicans understood how to govern until now. The dog has caught the car. If they start repealing environmental protections, which was part of their pandering message, that will be incredibly unpopular and they will lose politically.â€ Athan Manuel, director of Sierra Clubâ€™s land protection program, added: â€œSarah Palin would be nothing short of a disaster for our national parks and public lands if she were appointed as secretary of the interior.     Sarah Palin: â€˜Nothing short of a disaster for our national parks and public lands if she were appointed.â€™ Photograph: Joseph Connoly/Getty Images   â€œSheâ€™d want to drill in so many places that she would not be able to see Russia from Alaska any more because of all the oil rigs.â€ Republicans have pushed in Congress for public lands to be opened up for fossil fuel extraction and other developments and are already lining up the elimination of various regulations. Restrictions around drilling and fracking, as well as the moratorium on coal mining, may be lifted.   â€œYouâ€™re going to find that we are going to repeal a half-dozen or more regulations in the first week of Congress,â€ Republican senator Rand Paul told MSNBC.   â€œAnd Iâ€™m excited about it because I think the regulations have been killing our jobs and making us less competitive with the world.â€  Some environmentalists are hopeful that the new administration will stop short of wholesale repeal and can instead focus Trumpâ€™s attention upon crumbling infrastructure he has promised to fix.  â€œThereâ€™s a huge opportunity to address infrastructure and put nature in the picture for that, given the state of our national parks,â€ said Lynn Scarlett, managing director of public policy at the Nature Conservancy and a former deputy secretary of the interior under George W Bush.  â€œWe will be vigilant about efforts to advance energy development anywhere and everywhere. Those regulations are there for very good reasons and there is very strong bipartisan support for clean air and clean water.  â€œI donâ€™t know who will end up being secretary of the interior. Itâ€™s typically a former elected official and someone from the west. I would hope itâ€™s someone who has a broad understanding of public lands and isnâ€™t just energy, energy, energy. Thatâ€™s not really a profile that looks like Sarah Palin.â€",1

"Imagine a vendor on the National Mall, selling burgers and dogs, who hasnâ€™t paid his rent in 20 years. He refuses to recognize his landlord, the National Park Service, as a legitimate authority. Every court has ruled against him, and fines have piled up. Whatâ€™s more, the effluents from his food cart are having a detrimental effect on the spring grass in the capital.Would an armed posse come to his defense, aiming their guns at the park police? Would the lawbreaker get prime airtime on Fox News, breathless updates in the Drudge Report, a sympathetic ear from Tea Party Republicans? No, of course not.So whatâ€™s the difference between the fictional loser and Cliven Bundy, the rancher in Nevada who owes the government about $1 million and has been grazing his cattle on public land for more than 20 years? Near as I can tell, one wears a cowboy hat. Easterners, especially clueless ones in politics and the press, have always had a soft spot for a defiant white dude in a Stetson.This phony event has brought out the worst of the gun-waving far right, and the national politicians who are barely one degree of separation from them. Hundreds of heavily armed, camouflaged supporters of the scofflaw turned out Saturday in Nevada, training their rifles on public employees who were trying to do their job. The outsiders looked like snipers ready to shoot the police. If you changed that picture to Black Panthers surrounding a lawful eviction in the inner city, do you think right-wing media would be there cheering the outlaws?With their assault rifles and threats, the thugs in the desert forced federal officials with the Bureau of Land Management to back down from a court-ordered confiscation of Bundyâ€™s cattle. One of the rancherâ€™s supporters, Richard Mack, a Tea Party leader who is in the National Rifle Associationâ€™s Hall of Fame, said he planned to use women as human shields in a violent showdown with law enforcement.â€œWe were actually strategizing to put all the women up front,â€ Mack said in a radio interview. â€œIf they were going to start shooting, itâ€™s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot.â€Thatâ€™s who Fox and friends are playing with these days â€” militia extremists who would sacrifice their wives to make some larger point about a runaway federal government. And whatâ€™s more, the Fox host Sean Hannity has all but encouraged a violent confrontation.At the center of the dispute is the 68-year-old rancher Bundy, who said in a radio interview, â€œI donâ€™t recognize the United States government as even existing.â€ A real patriot, this guy. You would think that kind of anarchist would draw a raised eyebrow from the Tea Party establishment that provides Bundy his media oxygen. After all, wasnâ€™t the Tea Party born in a rant by Rick Santelli of CNBC about deadbeat homeowners? He complained about taxpayersâ€™ subsidizing â€œlosersâ€™ mortgagesâ€ and he said we should â€œreward people that can carry the water instead of drinking the water.â€ Believe me, Bundyâ€™s cattle are drinking an awful lot of our water, and not paying for it.But instead, people like Ron Paul have only fanned the flames, warning of a Waco-style assault. Paul and his son, Senator Rand Paul, further showed themselves to be stunningly ignorant of the public lands legacy created by forward-thinking Republicans a century ago.Â  â€œThey had virtual ownership of that land because they had been using it,â€ Ron Paul said on Fox, referring to the Bundy clan. â€œYou need the government out of it, and I think thatâ€™s the important point.â€No, the renegade rancher has no more right to 96,000 acres of Nevada public range than a hot dog vendor has to perpetual space on the Mall. Both places belong to the American people. Bundy runs his cattle on our land â€” that is, turf owned by every citizen. The agency that oversees the range, the Bureau of Land Management, allows 18,000 grazing permits on 157 million acres. Many of those permit holders get a sweet deal, subsidized in a way they could never find on private land.Whatâ€™s more, the land is supposed to be managed for stewardship and other users. Wild-horse advocates would like a piece of the same range. The poor desert tortoise, which has been in Nevada a lot longer than Bundyâ€™s Mormon pioneer stock, is disappearing because of abusive grazing on that same 96,000 acres.Ranching is hard work. Drought and market swings make it a tough go in many years. Thatâ€™s all the more reason to praise the 18,000 or so ranchers who pay their grazing fees on time and donâ€™t go whining to Fox or summoning a herd of armed thugs when they renege on their contract. You can understand why the Nevada Cattlemenâ€™s Association wants no part of Bundy.These kinds of showdowns are rare because most ranchers play by the rules, and quietly go about their business. They are heroes, in one sense, preserving a way of life that has an honorable place in American history. The good ones would never wave a gun in the face of a public servant, and likely never draw a camera from Fox.",1

"Smart Meter Spying Finally AdmittedBy Warren Woodward Of course they didnt quite put it that bluntly. In fact, they celebrate the ability of utilities to know what appliances people use as another tool to help craft the wonderful world of the future. Below is my letter to the Arizona Corporation Commission pointing out that industry has finally come out and admitted what I and others have been saying for years. [Note from Take Back Your Power: Its important that you send your utility your notice of Non-Consent via registered mail. Subscribe to our Newsletter for forthcoming news, and see our Solutions page for current links to templates.] The SmartGridNews article, entitled Now utilities can tell customers how much energy each appliance uses (just from the smart meter data), is here. May 15, 2014 Ladies and Gentlemen; Here is breaking news. SmartGridNews has just come out of the closet and admitted what I and others have been saying all long: Smart meters are surveillance devices. SmartGridNews calls such smart grid industry names as Telvent, Silver Spring Networks and Lockheed Martin its major sponsors. So of course the news story attempts to put a positive spin on the surveillance, hyping such nonsense as an over 4% conservation [of energy] after just a few months. Wow, that means I might save four whole dollars and change on a one hundred dollar electrical bill. Where do I sign up to be spied on? Enclosed is the SmartGridNews article, Now utilities can tell customers how much energy each appliance uses (just from the smart meter data). Sincerely, PS In the article, note the creepy picture of a guy dressed in black and using binoculars. SmartGridNews is shameless to promote Peeping Toms as cool. Note also Orwellian phrasing such as behavioral science and turning ratepayers into willing partners. Its not a smart grid; its a sick grid. Related selfnews Post Article: This article first appeared here at Take Back Your Power. I ran into this blog by pure coincidence, I was googling a picture of smart meters. You are a bunch of crazy paranoid people. I can show you several examples of how smart meters allow very poor families in Africa and Asia to access electricity and help them to use it without wasting precious resources. Of course, poverty is something that you people have no clue about. If you really dont like the idea of smart meters, buy a PV panel and go offline and dont complain if thats not enough to cover your nice American way of living with AC, fans, TVs, fridges, dishwashers, dryers, etc. FYI: Smart Meters aim is to achieve demand modelling. Demand modelling is used for pricing. Basically you pay less for basic needs: lighting and warm comfort. In this way, more people can afford their basic needs. On the other hand you pay more for luxury: big TVs and overuse of ACs. A single price is monopoly, communism, nor democratic! ",0
"Monsantos Roundup, Glyphosate Linked to Parkinsons and Similar DiseasesElizabeth Renter New research, published in the journal Neurotoxicology and Teratology, indicates a connection between a component in Monsantos Roundup and Parkinsons disease. Glyphosate is said to induce cell death, with frightening repercussions. GreenMedInfo.com reports the study was investigating the links between herbicides (weed killers) and brain damage. These chemicals, the studys authors say, have been recognized as the main environmental factor associated with neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinsons. Parkinsons disease is a degenerative nervous system disease. It slowly progresses as time goes on with common symptoms like tremors, rigidity, difficulty walking, poor posture, lack of movement, and slowness of movement, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. The CDC reports Parkinsons as the 14th leading cause of death in the U.S. In 2010 (the last year for which data is available), there was 4.6% increase in the number of deaths attributed to this disease. One has to wonder if there is a connection between this jump and the ever-growing prevalence of herbicides like Roundup in our air, food, and water. Studies indicate that glyphosate is toxic to human DNA at concentrations diluted 450-fold lower than used in agricultural applications. Worded differentlythe levels considered safe by our government are 450 times the levels at which glyphosate has been found to damage and destroy human DNA. Yes, its that serious. Whats so scary about the growing body of research on Monsantos Roundup, its components, and their presence in nearly everything around us, is that the federal government refuses to recognize the risk. Despite a growing concern on an international level, the powers-that-be are seemingly content to turn their eyes while the people demand accountability and safe food. Until pesticides and herbicides are no longer used on a mass scale, the growth of these diseases will likely continue. Eat 100% organic produce whenever possible to bypass exposure to destructive pesticides and herbicides.

"Tom Clancy, bestselling author of such military thrillers as The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games, is being treated like an actual terrorism expert, having offered his opinion on Larry King Live and countless other TV shows since Sept. 11. 'The Al Qaeda network is known to have operatives in at least 30 countries, including the U.S. and Great Britain,' said Clancy, a former insurance broker and avid wearer of naval-warship baseball caps, during a recent Nightline. 'By the way, Ted, Stephen Ambrose's The Wild Blue is a terrific read.'

"Organizing Against TyrannyBrandon Smith For the liberty movement, the movement against globalization and forced centralization of financial and political power, lies are simply not an option. The internationalists have already cornered the market on lies, so we must take a completely contrary approach. We must organize around the truth, no matter how painful it happens to be. This is a much more difficult prospect, one many people dont understand or appreciate. There are a lot of complaints in the movement about the lack of what they consider effective organization, and the frustration is in some ways beginning to evolve into fear. Here are some core inconsistencies I believe are at the heart of organizational problems within the liberty movement and what we can do to solve them. Re-examining Our Concept Of Real Organization For multiple generations, Americans and most of the rest of the world have been conditioned to believe that organization is a top-down affair that requires a central leadership that hands orders across the ranks of a rigid structure. The people within the structure operate as parts of a greater machine, and the success of the machine is (supposedly) directly related to how close the smaller parts (people) work together and follow those orders. Unfortunately, many activists in the liberty movement also assume that this is what an organization is and how it works. Surely, there is a need for people with a talent to inspire others to thought and to action. But these men and women are nothing unless they can motivate individuals to eventually take their own initiative without orders. A true leader is a teacher nothing more. And if he really cares about the future prosperity of the people he is teaching, that teachers objective will be for his students to exceed his own capabilities and to become independent in their accomplishments. For a movement driven by a desire for the preservation of freedom and sovereignty, organization requires structure, but not rigidity or centralized leadership. The collectivist model of the human machine or hive is a flawed model that oppresses individual contributions that could be revolutionary. The corporate model, for instance, is a perfect example of an organization built mostly on lies (just look at the inconsistencies of real debts versus real profits for most major companies) and that fuels itself on the integration of people as replaceable gears and bolts on a rusted, shuddering Ferris wheel ride. Corporations might appear to make money, but they never meet their ultimate potential as organizations because most of the people within them could not care less about the purpose or even health of the system as long as they continue to draw a paycheck. When an organization merely limps along on the thin thread of the survival principle, this is the opposite of success. The liberty movement has to abandon outmoded and ill-conceived notions of mainstream organizational models and take more stock in decentralized activity. A lack of an arbitrarily designated pecking order or the pyramid scheme of top-down branching management is a good thing for our cause, not a disadvantage. Legitimate Structure And Purpose Just because a movement is decentralized does not mean it should lack a foundation, and that foundation should be composed of a primary purpose and a primary plan of action. This is where some liberty activists seem to become most nihilistic in their thinking. They have been looking for top-down leadership, which doesnt exist and shouldnt exist. They have been looking for a set plan of attack, which no one can seem to agree on. And they moan relentlessly about what they see as the lack of a singular, universal vision of what the ultimate goal should be. I have heard the argument more than once that the liberty movement will fail because victory would require us to all agree on one ideological vision and a rather singular strategy. What they dont appear to realize is that a vision and strategy already exist that most of us agree on. Again, our society has been conditioned to see through only a very narrow window of what constitutes organization that demands we adhere to the top-down philosophy. However, most liberty activists already agree on the bottom-up goal of self-reliance and self-sufficiency in all things, from food and water to education, security and governance. There will be no mass majority movement on Washington in a V for Vendetta-style march led by some heroic masked man. And even if there were, it would accomplish nothing unless the top of the globalist pyramid was toppled (Occupy Wall Street is a good example of how such theatrics fail). This goal of a mass awakening is a common fantasy and an impractical one; but self-sufficiency, mutual aid and mutual defense are realistic efforts, given the likely short amount of time we have left. The universal vision is right in front of our faces and always has been: to break away from the corrupt mainstream system, to remove our dependency, to provide our own necessities and, thus, to remove our consent. Every liberty proponent in America should be able to pursue this goal without prompting from any centralized leadership, and it encompasses every aspect of the fight against tyranny. Make your family self-sufficient and secure without aid of government. Make your neighborhood self-sufficient and secure. Make your town or county self-sufficient and secure. If the elites try to stop you, fight back and from a position on the moral high ground. If enough communities defend themselves the prospect of martial law or totalitarian control becomes systemically impossible, politically and strategically. I rarely run into liberty advocates who disagree with this plan, yet they do nothing and refuse to even make the attempt because they are still waiting around for someone to give them a plan. Stop waiting around for the next Gandhi or George Washington and do what you already know needs to be done. It is truly as simple as that. Changing Our Idea Of Leadership As stated earlier, you do not need a man on a white horse to ride in and save you from the terrifying idea of self-responsibility. If you are waiting for someone to come down off the mountain with magical stone tablets and lead you to the promised land, you are going to find yourself rather disappointed. Despite popular belief, men do not organize other men; only ideas given focus organize men. Men rally around that which they love or that which they hate. Leadership is often incidental, or sadly, manipulative. So, by extension, we can conclude that to develop a strong organization, the ideal must be honest and honorable, the plan must be decentralized and natural for individuals to implement, and those who coordinate the organizational efforts must do so with the realization that they are stewards of the principles of that movement and that those principles are more important than their glory. If activists plan to become followers of anything, it should be solid principles. Leaders are secondary. Destructive Egomania In my time in the movement, I have seen relatively good men with sound ideals exhibit insane behavior and absurd motives when exposed to a mere 15 minutes of fame. Ego is truly the greatest Achilles heel of any activist organization. This is a fact that corrupt governments are highly aware of. If you look into the history of the FBIs subversive Cointelpro efforts from the 1950s onward, you will find a common tactic used to dismantle anti-establishment groups, which is to sow discord among organizers and coordinators by feeding egos and turning them against each other. Like the ring of power in the Lord of The Rings books, the desire for leadership can blind people to the greater cause. They develop delusions of grandeur, thinking they are the next guru, the next prophet, the next man to lead the charge to permanent historical stardom. Each person believes that if only he had the ring, if only he were the leader, he could resist the temptations of power and achieve what others could not. And so he refuses to work with others or to share the stage, or he even attempts to subvert or co-opt the legitimate accomplishments of more capable men. The only solution is to cast off the ring forever, to care nothing for the supposed glories of leadership and to work only for the betterment of others. I have also seen people within the movement fall victim to the admiration of their own fan base. Positive feedback from readers is certainly helpful, but I would be writing everything I write now even if every email I received were laced with vitriol (sometimes they are). The truth does not require fans; it functions fine without them. Liberty champions do, on occasion, receive letters of adoration from being compared to Thomas Paine all the way to being labeled the next Jesus (the former being flattering and the latter being just plain weird). The problem is not public appreciation; it is the cult of celebrity that many Americans have grown too attached to, as well as the fact that some activists in more public positions have a hard time handling positive attention without their heads expanding 10 sizes too big. The fact is I dont matter, liberty leaders and personalities dont matter, the limelight doesnt matter, and the level of our fan base doesnt matter. All that matters is how effectively and efficiently we can get the facts to the public. Organization suffers when the cult of celebrity takes over, whether in the minds of activists or in the minds of the people who represent them in the media. Fear Of Risk Leads To Inaction In my work with groups such as Oath Keepers and its Community Preparedness Team program, I have taken what some might consider sizable risks, and I have witnessed others who have gone even further. And in this risk I have seen the kinds of progress in organization I have never seen anywhere else. Without risk, there can be no organization against tyranny and, thus, no chance of success. If you are afraid to be put on the naughty list in the National Security Agency database, if you are afraid you might lose your job, if you are afraid you might be labeled an extremist or if you are afraid of uneducated public perception and this has prevented you from building mutual aid and defense groups where you live, then you have already lost everything. Fear leads to inaction, and inaction is death. I have even witnessed members of organizations attempt to prevent others from taking positive measures like training for community defense because they are so fearful of what might happen due to their affiliation they will actually work against the better goals of the people around them. All I can say is that fear-driven people have to be removed from organizational environments, or they will poison the waters until the entire venture flatlines. Risk is inevitable. It is unavoidable. All anti-establishment, anti-tyranny movements depend on it. The more people willing to take risks, the more effectively safe that risk becomes. This includes the fear of defense and the fear of losing ones life in the process. Every scenario, even the worst-case scenario, has to be considered and then set aside as irrelevant. Fear has no place in the minds or actions of liberty champions. Remove fear, and world-changing organization becomes possible. REMINDER: Alt-Markets winter donation drive is now underway!

"Iâ€™d be interested in your views on Amazon Marketplace, as we have found that it offers no consumer protection or any help in dealing with a supplier.  Earlier this year my daughter bought some Nike trainers from Legend Footwear. At Â£103 they were not cheap, but of surprisingly poor quality. Within two months the back of one had split to the point that it was unwearable. We contacted Legend but were told that because the shoes were more than 30 days old, the company had no liability.  When I explained that the Consumer Rights Act 2015 requires that goods should last a reasonable length of time, it asked for some photos of the damage. The photos were fine, but we were told they were insufficient. After sending more we were told that the shoes showed â€œexcessive wearâ€. My daughter had worn them to school for a few days each week for about six weeks. At that point we wrote to Amazon (my daughter had put Â£60 of Amazon vouchers towards the shoes), Nike and Santander (to ask for a â€œchargebackâ€ refund of the amount she had paid from her own account). Nike and Santander ignored our letter; Amazonâ€™s line was the same as Legendâ€™s â€“ because the shoes were more than 30 days old, it wouldnâ€™t help. Our conclusion was that if you want to buy anything where the defects might appear after 30 days, youâ€™d be much better off using a traditional high street outlet. RC, Oxford Ahead of the Christmas shopping frenzy, this letter is a timely reminder that buying through Amazon Marketplace offers you less consumer protection than if you buy direct from well-known websites, as well paying for items in excess of Â£100 by credit card. It also shows that there are some companies on Amazon that will try and deny you your consumer rights. The Consumer Rights Act is clearly on your side and states that if a fault occurs within six months, it is automatically assumed to have been present at the time of manufacture, unless the retailer can show otherwise. We think most reasonable people would expect a Â£100 pair of trainers to last more than two months, and that Legendâ€™s stance is unacceptable. We contacted the company but it has declined to respond to your points. The person who answered the phone tried to claim that a pair a trainers should only be expected to last a few weeks, which is revealing in itself. Amazon confirmed that its A-Z guarantee protection is only for 30 days. In such cases, a spokesman said, the contract is always between the buyer and the selling firm â€“ in this case Legend. However, something has happened behind the scenes because he also said that a refund would now be applied to your daughterâ€™s account. The moral here is that if you have a problem with a Marketplace-bought item, you are on your own after 30 days. In 2013 I revealed how buyers of Marketplace items costing more than Â£100 were not entitled to section 75 consumer protection that enables them to hold the credit card firm jointly liable for goods. It is because Amazon collects the money and passes it on to the retailer minus its commission. The same is true of using PayPal. To gain section 75 protection you have to pay the retailer direct using a credit card. And be aware, we have seen a big jump in complaints about footwear over the past 12 months, and an increasingly poor attitude from shoe retailers. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

"In what observers called a stunning and unexpected display of oratorical eloquence and candor, Vice President Joe Biden delivered a deeply articulate and heartfelt speech at the conclusion of Thursday nights vice presidential debate, reportedly moving the entire audience at Centre College to tears. After moderator Martha Raddatz asked Biden to give his closing statements, the former senator stared down at his prepared statement for several moments before setting it aside, standing on top of the table in front of him, and sharing a series of frank, poignant personal reflections as a surprised and reverent hush fell across the auditorium. I know people expect me to embarrass myself right now, or to do something reckless or silly, but Im not going to do thatnot tonight, said Biden, his voice suddenly tinged with what observers described as a degree of warmth and tender regret never before heard from the veteran politician. I know how you people see methe fast cars, the hitchhiking, the trips to Jurez. You know me, ol stumbling numbnuts Joe Biden. Right? Well, shit, Ill be the first to admit that I aint no saint. No, sir, I suppose I aint much of a role model, either. But when it comes right down to it, even with all my flaws, I am a human being. With hopes, with dreams, and with love in my heart. Go ahead and laugh at Uncle Joe, or call him a fool if you likeIm not going to stop ya, Biden continued. But know that I have a soul, and that my soul bleeds. Hell, I may not always know which way Im going, or why, but god damn it if Im not trying the best I can. The everloving best I can. Biden then reportedly paused, pulled a carton of cigarettes and a Zippo lighter from his back pocket, lit a cigarette, took a few puffs, and stared silently at the ceiling before once again addressing the audience. Listen, I know Im the last person in the world to give you all a lecture on morality, said Biden pacing the tabletop as the auditorium lights laid bare every world-weary crease and crevice in his 69-year-old face. Ive sure as shit made my fair share of mistakes. Ive ridden through some pretty dicey places in my Trans-Am, had one or two run-ins with the law, and spent more than a few nights in county. Ive done thingsterrible things. Ive got a list of regrets a mile wide, and there are nights when those regrets frankly tear me up inside. Just tear me right up. But despite all this, I still have my dignity, Biden added. And nobody can take that away from me, no matter what. Its what keeps me human. Its what keeps me alive. Sources confirmed the Obama campaign was completely taken aback by the vice presidents sudden departure from the expected debate rhetoric, having reportedly instructed Biden to stick to the issues and refrain from going off-topic. However, many staffers were said to be incredibly moved by the sincerity of Bidens words, with senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs calling it a revelation and a glimpse into the bruised soul of a man whos lived 10 lifetimes. While acknowledging the ongoing criticism of Obama over the past week, a misty-eyed Biden offered an honest and personal account of his running mate while arguing for voters to give the president a second term. Weve been through some crazy times, me and Barry, said Biden, taking a quick swig from a flask he pulled from the inside pocket of his leather jacket. Hes caught me on his roof doing some stuff I probably shouldnt have been doing. Stuff Im not proud of, despite how cocky I might act. But you know what? I trust him. And he trusts me. I dont want to make some big political speech up here, but I will tell you right now that Barrys the guy to lead us. Hes a good fuckin man. Whats more, hes my dear friend. And I love him. Sources present at the debate claimed Biden became especially emotional in the middle of his speech when he spotted his wife of 35 years, Jill, in the audience. Jesus, Jillymy beautiful, beautiful Jilly, said Biden, turning to speak directly to his wife. Darlin, I know I havent been the perfect husband. Shit, far from it. Ive done some things with other women that have really put you in a tough spot. But you gotta believe me when I say that I never, ever meant to hurt you. I love you with all my heart, Jilly, added Biden, who maintained a stoic expression as his eyes welled with tears. I always have, and I always will. Wiping his eyes, Biden finally made a heartfelt appeal to Americans to try, if they could, to see the real Joe. My name is Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., said the vice president, his voice choking. Over the years I have been made an object of mockery and ridicule. I have seen pictures of me in the most humiliating positions you can think of plastered across newspapers all over the world. I have been treated as a punch line. A dope. A fuckin jester among kings. But dont be fooled. I am also a man who has touched sorrow. And I am a son of a bitch who has spent nearly seven decades on the razors edge and lived to tell the tale. I may not say it often, and I may never say it again, but I wish to say to you now that I am also a man worthy of love. And worthy of respect. Thank you all so damn much, Biden added. I justI love this country, man. Wiping his eyes, Biden then descended from the table and sat back down as the tearful and blindsided audience attempted to make sense of what they had just witnessed. After nearly a full minute of deeply moving silence, Biden then whistled loudly and admitted to the assembled crowd that he had a huge fuckin woody right now. ",0
"Unable to walk off the sideline under his own power, Eagles coach Andy Reid was loaded onto a medical cart and driven to the 50-yard line to shake hands with Saints coach Sean Payton after their game Sunday. According to those in attendance, a hush fell over the crowd during the 11 minutes the team's medical staff huddled around Reid, attempting to safely hoist the coach onto the cart with a crew of six grown men. 'Coach Reid was conscious, but his breathing was labored and he complained of intense pain all over his body,' team physician Dr. Peter DeLuca told reporters. 'Once we got him onto the cart we had to stabilize his neck out of fear that it couldn't support his head. The good news is, we only had to use the defibrillator twice.' After completing the handshake, Reid gave a thumbs-up to indicate that he wanted the straw in his milkshake to be raised up to his mouth. ",0
"Colorado Legalizes Recreational Marijuana and Industrial Hempselfnews Post Amendment 64 legalizes the personal use, possession, and limited home-growing of marijuana legal for adults 21 years of age and older; establishes a system in which marijuana is regulated and taxed similarly to alcohol; and allows for the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp. In particular, the law removes all legal penalties for personal possession of up to one ounce of marijuana and allows people to grow up to six marijuana plants at their home in an enclosed locked space. A study by the Colorado Center on Law and Policy found that marijuana legalization could produce more than $120 million annually in new revenue and savings within the first five years. Wholesale recreation cannabis in Colorado will be taxed at 15% with the first $40 million allocated to the Public School Capital Construction Assistance Fund. Two other states, Oregon and Washington, are also voting on similar measures. Early results showWashington state will likely legalize marijuana as well with the Yes votes leading by double digits for Initiative Measure 502. Meanwhile it appears Oregons Measure 80is headed for defeat. Massachusetts also voted by a dominant margin (63%) to legalize medical marijuana bringing the total number of medical cannabis states to 18. Read other articles by selfnews Post Here ",0
"WALTHAM - Brandeis University president Jehuda Reinharz, after months of sharp criticism over his financial stewardship and plans to close the university's renowned Rose Art Museum, announced Thursday that he will resign at the end of the academic year. The announcement, which caught many faculty and students off guard, signaled the end of a lengthy tenure that saw the Waltham university vaulted to greater national prominence. Yet in recent months, he was the target of an angry outcry over fiscal troubles at the university and a plan to auction precious works of art to raise money. Reinharz, who became president in 1994, said he plans to head a major nonprofit group focused on issues facing the international Jewish community, but at the request of trustees will stay on until a replacement is chosen, until June 2011. Reinharz dismissed suggestions that he is resigning under pressure arising from the museum controversy, saying he strongly considered stepping down in summer 2008 before signing a five-year contract extension. At 65, Reinharz said he felt the time had come to move on. 'This is not a decision I took lightly,' he said in an interview at his office Thursday afternoon. 'I've poured a lot of sweat and blood into this place, which I love. But I think the time is right.' Reinharz said he first told trustees a month ago that he planned to resign and formally notified them Thursday. In an e-mail sent late Thursday night to the university community, he said he had 'reached the conclusion that now is the right time for me to focus on the next chapter of my career.' 'Serving Brandeis for nearly three decades has been a great honor, which I have enjoyed immensely,' he wrote. 'I believe the future is very bright for the university and I am confident that my successor will take Brandeis to even greater heights.' Jack Connors, vice chairman of the trustees, said the decision to resign was Reinharz's, and that trustees urged him to stay on. 'I think that some people will regrettably focus on the past year, but if you look over his whole time at Brandeis, it's really an impressive record,' Connors said. Controversy over the museum erupted in January, when university officials announced plans to close its art museum and auction parts of its $350 million collection amid heavy investment losses and declining fund-raising. Facing withering criticism from faculty, alumni, and the art and philanthropic worlds, the university quickly pulled back, and Reinharz apologized, saying he 'screwed up.' The controversy, which garnered national headlines, brought a rebuke by more than 60 faculty members, who said Reinharz's handling of the situation had created a 'crisis of confidence' over his leadership. On Thursday, Reinharz said that faculty criticism did not influence his decision to resign and that he believed he had the support of most faculty members. 'I'm sure I've had my critics, but if you can find a university president who doesn't, I'll buy your lunch every day,' he quipped. 'And I have never felt I didn't have the support of the trustees.' In a letter sent Thursday to Reinharz, trustees chairman Malcolm Sherman thanked him for his dedication and achievements, saying the board would have 'greatly preferred' that he complete his term. 'Under your leadership, we have witnessed a heightened profile within the international academic community and an exceptionally diverse student body,' he wrote. During Reinharz's tenure, the university became far more selective, attracting a higher caliber of students, embarking on a major campus overhaul, building a number of sparkling new facilities, and establishing a range of new academic programs. He was considered a highly successful fund-raiser, attracting deep-pocketed donors who helped triple the university's endowment. 'He has raised Brandeis's national and international profile considerably,' said Richard Doherty, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts. 'He brought it out of the shadows.' After last fall's financial collapse, however, donations dried up and the value of investments plummeted. With the university forced to slash its budget, some faculty criticized Reinharz for overextending the university and relying too heavily on donations for Brandeis's growing day-to-day expenses. 'The last year has been one of upheaval that has caused somewhat of a split on campus,' said Michael Rosbash, a biology professor who said Reinharz's handling of the financial crisis cost him significant support. Others said the strategy paid long-term dividends. 'He deserves an incredible amount of credit,' said Sabine von Mering, a German professor and chairwoman of the faculty senate. 'Let's face it, Brandeis is a start-up, and start-ups have to take risks.' Reinharz said he believed the university has made significant strides and said he especially took pride in the increased racial and economic diversity among students. Yet with the university, and higher education as a whole, facing stiff economic challenges in the coming years, Reinharz said he felt it was a logical time to step aside. 'We'd love to have life just as it was before,' he said, calling the financial crisis a 'shock to the system' of higher education. 'But the reality is now we all have to make painful economic decisions.' ",1
"Players and fans alike are saying that Blake Griffin's latest dunk, while a solid, unstoppable one-handed jam, was actually more irritating than it was breathtaking or impressive. 'Just the way he palmed the ball was, like, Oh, I'm going to jump up with this and place it through the hoop now, ooh, look at me,' said Lakers center Andrew Bynum, adding that the dunk was 'probably going to come back to bug [him] all week at odd moments' until the playoffs started. 'And the way he jumped? Tell me that wasn't the most aggravating jump you've seen since Reggie Miller was playing.' Despite the generally acknowledged off-putting nature of Griffin's dunk, onlookers agreed Kobe Bryant was still the most annoying thing about the game. ",0
"With their collective-bargaining agreement less than a day away from expiring, NFL players expressed Thursday how thrilled they are at the prospect of a season-long work stoppage, saying that suffering near-traumatic injuries week in and week out is pretty much the worst. 'Sure, everybody loves the game and the money is great, but have you ever broken both the bones in your shin and been pressured by coaches and fans to play through it? It's really a horrible experience,' said players' union head DeMaurice Smith, adding that 12 months without football will spare several hundred men the pain of enduring multiple concussions.

"Only one thing could have stopped Jeremy Corbyn: if the coup mounted by the Labour right in the week beginning 27 June had actually been a coup. They had momentum â€“ anti-Corbyn shadow cabinet members at one point seemed to be resigning as fast as they were volunteering. If the Labour frontbench operation had collapsed through understaffing, leaving Corbyn incapable of fulfilling the duties of Her Majestyâ€™s Official Opposition, the way was open either to handing the role to the SNP â€“ or forming a separate â€œcontinuity Labourâ€ group in parliament. For those of us among what was, at that time, a loose alliance of rank-and-file Corbynistas, it felt like Stalingrad. We had our backs to the river and were throwing cavalry against tanks. What ended the crisis was not some counterstroke by Corbyn himself but the launch of Saving Labour. Saving Labour looked and smelled so similar to the operation launched by the cold war faction of Labour against the miners and printers in the 1980s that it was uncanny. All it needed to complete the parallel was for the MP Gloria De Piero to call for Sun readers to join Labour to overthrow Corbyn. That was the moment we realised the Corbyn leadership was not up against a serious organic revolt of members, but one manufactured by the neoliberal stay-behinds. As the result of the coupâ€™s failure, Labourâ€™s conference this week has a visible faultline running through it. People floating mysteriously between corporate fringe events, dressed in the sharp suits and shiny tights of the Blair-Brown era, are still there. But nobody really understands why.   Related: Why isn't Labour debating Brexit at its conference?   Networking between the remnants of the Mandelson set and pro-austerity Labour councils must be one of the most thankless tasks in PR right now; like being a court correspondent for a Tsarist newspaper during the Russian revolution. The contrast is not just with the bouncy, T-shirt-wearing graduates at the Momentum event, struggling as people queue round the block to hear from the Sex Workers Open University, Podemos and Black Lives Matter. Inside the conference, too, what used to be known as the â€œwoolly-hat brigadeâ€ â€“ working-class people with a lifelong commitment to socialism â€“ have begun to jostle into packed meeting rooms and find their voice. Having spent much of the summer alongside the people who delivered Corbynâ€™s victory, two things are obvious that the media coverage has missed. First: this is a real, networked reinvention of social democracy. My heart leapt on Saturday when the SWP handed me a leaflet saying it did not want to be part of Corbynâ€™s Labour. The feeling is mutual. Though there are undoubtedly far-left activists inside Momentum, they are a small minority swimming in a sea of networked, horizontal, democratic, globalist and liberal young professionals who regard them, largely, as oddities. When the man in charge of crowdfunding the Momentum fringe event approached me for help, I asked what had brought him into this. Heâ€™d studied social movements at university, he said, and spent five years in banking. Though Corbyn himself, and many of his rally-goers, are gung-ho for scrapping Trident, this young inner core of activists understands the difference between principles and tactics. They know theyâ€™ve been handed a historic opportunity to pursue one thing â€“ social justice â€“ and theyâ€™ve no intention of letting it slip. The second thing media coverage misses is the pent-up excitement Corbyn is tapping into. He has become Zen-like himself. But I have never seen the streets around a political conference venue come alive in the way Liverpool did with Labour this weekend. â€œThe whole cityâ€™s buzzing,â€ a bloke said, accosting me. He had his teenage son with him; they were on their way between the Momentum fringe and a pro-Corbyn comedy event. The challenge is to turn that buzz into something relevant to service personnelâ€™s families on a rainy estate in Portsmouth; or to Scots enthralled by the cultural renaissance of their nation; or jobless kids in the Welsh valleys drawn by the white identity politics of Ukip. For me, a bit-part player in the failed Bennite movement and witness to the betrayal of the printers and the miners, Corbynâ€™s victory on Saturday was about more than politics. On the way there, I checked my family tree on the Ancestry website. From about 1790 my patrilineal line goes: labourer, hatter, hatter, hatter, miner, miner, economics editor. Some of that recent upward mobility is a result of the postwar boom â€“ which itâ€™s now fashionable to claim was a one-off in the history of capitalism. Some of it was about how Labour shaped the postwar boom in the interests of the working class. On my way to the announcement, in a bus stop, I scrawled a sign I wanted to hold up if Corbyn won. It said: â€œThis is for all our ancestors.â€ But the event itself was quiet, stunned; nobody sang The Red Flag. There was a media scrum but a hall half empty. So unused to events of historic significance have we become that we wander around concussed when they happen. People who wish the event had not happened rush to the airwaves to denounce them. But you cannot stop history. At some point, having been hijacked by the elite class, Labour was always either going to collapse â€“ as it has done in Scotland â€“ or revive. What we witnessed was both revival and survival. Labourâ€™s polls â€“ in the teeth of a hostile press and active sabotage from within â€“ may be low. But they are the highest of any socialist party in Europe.",1

"  7.54pm BST   So thatâ€™s it for today. ESA will make their next official statements about the Trace Gas Orbiter and the Schiaparelli lander at 9am UK time tomorrow.  For the TGO, everything is peachy. The spacecraft is in the expected orbit and functioning normally. For Schiaparelli things donâ€™t look so good.  The signal was received for a good part of its journey through the Martian atmosphere but was lost before the lander reached the surface. This is confirmed by both the radio telescope tracking from Earth and the Mars Express spacecraft, which was recording the descent from orbit. Although it would be a disappointment for the landing to fail at the last moment, the most important thing was that it happens now and not in 2020 when ESA send their life-detecting rover to the surface.  So all in all, today was a success. A fantastic new science mission is now in orbit around Mars and the landing test returned invaluable data for the engineers to make the 2020 landing safer. And that seems like a good place to leave the blog. Thanks for joining us today. Itâ€™s been a good one for space exploration.     7.42pm BST   And with that, ESA brings the press conference to a end.     7.41pm BST   ESAâ€™s director general Jan Woerner is saying that regardless of what happened to Schiaparelli, this test was a success. He says that they did this to get data about how to land on Mars with European technology - and that is what is downloading from Mars Express right now. Although he refuses to give up hope (he says, â€œCross your fingers stillâ€), no one is talking now about the hope of signals being received by Nasaâ€™s MRO spacecraft.  Updated at 7.46pm BST    7.37pm BST   The detailed diagnostic data from Mars Express is being downloaded now. That will be all received by midnight and then the engineers will work all night to understand what happened. Ferri says that they hope to have the story of what happened to the lander by tomorrow morning.  Updated at 7.40pm BST    7.35pm BST   ESAâ€™s Paolo Ferri, Head of Mission Operations Department at European Space Operations Centre says that this is not a good sign.  Updated at 8.29pm BST    7.33pm BST   The Mars Express measurement confirms that the signal from the lander stopped before the landing.     7.32pm BST   ESA confirm that the signal from the lander stopped unexpectedly.     7.32pm BST   Now for some news about the lander.     7.31pm BST   Michel Denis, the ESA ExoMars flight director, says that the Trace Gas Orbiter is definitely in orbit around Mars. It is in a four-day orbit and is working well.  Updated at 7.32pm BST    7.28pm BST   Here we go. ESA is back online to report on whether they have heard from the Schiaparelli lander.     7.12pm BST   Good to see that Twitter is doing its best to keep us entertained while we wait.  The wait goes on.... #ExoMars pic.twitter.com/ilJlXp4Qraâ€” AWESOME ASTRONOMY (@AwesomeAstroPod) October 19, 2016   me waiting schiapparelli signal #ExoMars pic.twitter.com/KmHZ749EI1â€” Andrea D'altri (@mrdaltri) October 19, 2016   Updated at 7.21pm BST    7.08pm BST   Todayâ€™s landing attempt was a rehearsal for 2020, when ESA plan to put a highly capable rover on the surface of Mars. According to their website:   The ExoMars rover will travel across the Martian surface to search for signs of life. It will collect samples with a drill and analyse them with next-generation instruments. ExoMars will be the first mission to combine the capability to move across the surface and to study Mars at depth.  Given the complexity and expense of the rover, ESA decided to add the Schiaparelli lander to the Trace Gas Orbiter as a test for the technologies that will be required in 2020.  Even if todayâ€™s landing failed at the last moment, as looks likely, the data collected will be invaluable in designing a better system to make sure that the rovers gets to the surface in one piece.  Updated at 7.21pm BST    6.55pm BST   He has a point. Perhaps itâ€™s days like today that show us how much work there is still to be done before we send humans to Mars.  Think about how worried space nerds are right now about #ExoMars, and then imagine a future when real people are at the end of that concern.â€” ScaretasticRover (@SarcasticRover) October 19, 2016      6.49pm BST   While itâ€™s a tense wait to discover the fate of the Schiaparelli lander, ESA are reporting that everything is working well on the Trace Gas Orbiter. This is good because the orbiter is where 99% of the science from this mission is going to come from.  Updated at 6.51pm BST    6.28pm BST   Clearly something did not go according to plan with the landing. If Schiaparelli does not communicate with Nasaâ€™s MRO spacecraft during the upcoming pass that must be a strong indication of failure.  .@ESA_EDM recording from #MarsExpress is inconclusive - not clear yet what the status of the lander is #ExoMarsâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016   Next opportunity to hear from @ESA_EDM will be the relay pass with @NASAJPL's MRO spacecraft - should come in the next hour or two #ExoMarsâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016   Updated at 6.30pm BST    6.11pm BST   The Schiaparelli lander is named after the 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. He was born on 14 March 1835, 181 years to the very day before the launch of the mission that bears his name. During his career he observed Mars and named the major features that could be seen from Earth, calling them â€œseasâ€ and â€œcontinentsâ€. He also thought he saw â€œchannelsâ€ on Mars. These are now known to be optical illusions but they sparked a popular idea that they were â€œcanalsâ€ built by Martians in a desperate attempt to irrigate their dying world.  Updated at 6.14pm BST    5.59pm BST   Woerner is still sounding hopeful that Schiaparelli is alive on the surface of Mars. The big test is coming in about one-and-a-half hours when the lander is programmed to talk to Nasaâ€™s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Updated at 6.10pm BST    5.55pm BST   Igor Komarov, the director general of Roscosmos, the Russian Space Agency, is speaking in very positive terms about the collaboration between Russia and Europe during this mission. He is looking forward to more collaboration in the future. ESAâ€™s director general Jan Woerner returns the sentiments.  Updated at 5.57pm BST    5.49pm BST   ESA are running a first person Twitter account for the Trace Gas Orbiter.  Hello, #Earth! Did you miss me?! #ExoMars https://t.co/hjXg3RTvCYâ€” ExoMars orbiter (@ESA_TGO) October 19, 2016   Updated at 5.56pm BST    5.46pm BST   UK astronaut Tim Peake says that the mission is extremely exciting. He is also talking about an experiment he performed during his time in space, when he remotely controlled an experimental rover on Earth from the International Space Station.  Astronauts controlling rovers from the orbit of the moon and Mars is seen as a very likely next step, and a way to link human and robotic exploration of the nearby worlds.  Updated at 5.47pm BST    5.41pm BST   The Mars Express data from the Schiaparelli lander is being analysed now. There are clear signals of key moments, such as the parachute deployment, so it is clear that the lander passed successfully through the atmosphere but there is still a big question mark over whether it survived the touchdown. But, ESA say it is still too premature to draw conclusions about its fate.     5.37pm BST   From a vigil-like feeling in ESAâ€™s mission control centre as spacecraft operators watched for the signal to return, there is now back-slapping, cheers and applause. The main science mission is â€˜go!â€™.     5.36pm BST   The Trace Gas Orbiter is â€˜very likelyâ€™ in orbit around Mars. The signal has re-appeared at the expected time.     5.34pm BST   ESA engineers are waiting for the TGO to make contact as it comes out of eclipse from behind Mars. If it phones home at close to the calculated time this will be an excellent indicator that it is in the correct orbit around Mars.     5.30pm BST   The ESA flight dynamics team will calculate the Trace Gas Orbiterâ€™s orbit around Mars as soon as the signal is received in a few minutes time.  A full house for our #FlightDynamics maths experts as they eagerly wait for the emergence of @ESA_TGO from behind Mars #ExoMars pic.twitter.com/gZyPsF2jgaâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016      5.27pm BST   We are now just minutes away from discovering whether the Trace Gas Orbiter went into orbit around Mars successfully.     5.26pm BST   Mars is a difficult planet to land on because of a combination of factors. Firstly, it is a large planet and so has a strong pull of gravity that must be counteracted using retrorockets or parachutes. However: secondly, Mars has only a thin atmosphere and so heatshields and parachutes have only a limited effect.      5.19pm BST   The Trace Gas Orbiter is where the vast majority of the science of this mission was always designed to come from. It will orbit Mars for years looking at the atmosphere in more detail than anyone has ever done before. Of particular interest is whether methane is found in Marsâ€™s atmosphere. In 2003, Mars Express made a tentative detection of the gas, which sparked excitement because methane is a short-lived gas, and on Earth it is produced mainly by life forms. In 2014, Nasaâ€™s Curiosity rover also detected whiffs of the gas. This increased speculation that perhaps there were microbial communities still alive on Mars, producing the gas. However, there is also the chance that the methane is produced by geological processes. The TGO is designed to help explore these different possibilities.  Updated at 5.23pm BST    5.13pm BST   Even if the lander doesnâ€™t work as planned, valuable lessons will be learnt from the attempt. The Mars Express spacecraft recorded data from Schiaparelli all the way down to the surface. That data is being transmitted back to Earth now for analysis. It is the equivalent of the data recorded by an aircraftâ€™s â€˜black boxâ€™ flight recorder.     5.04pm BST   Denis also confirms that the Schiaparelli data from Mars Express is being downlinked now. About half an hour from now, they hope to be able to say something about the landerâ€™s fate. A key moment will then occur in about a hour from now when Schiaparelli is designed to wake up and send signals to Nasaâ€™s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Itâ€™s still all to play for!  Updated at 5.05pm BST    5.00pm BST   Michel Denis says he is very confident that the TGO completed its orbit insertion manoeuvre. Confirmation should come in about 30 minutes.     4.58pm BST   This could be a reason for optimism. If the size of the Schiaparelli landing recording is consistent with the expected size it would seem to indicate that Schiaparelli worked as expected down to the surface. But the big question is: did it survive the landing?  Engineer @marwood82 report to #FlightDirector: size of @ESA_EDM recording on-board #MarsExpress is consistent with expected size #ExoMarsâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016   Updated at 5.01pm BST    4.53pm BST  Mars landing: what we know so far   The Schiaparelli lander has fallen silent during the last moments of its decent to Mars.  It was being tracked from Earth by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), located in Pune, India.  During its descent through the atmosphere, the GMRT saw several â€œjumpsâ€ in the signal that correspond to key events taking place correctly on the lander, such as the parachute being deployed.  Flight controllers at ESA are refusing to â€œjump to conclusionsâ€, preferring to wait until they can analyse the data recorded by the Mars Express spacecraft, which was in detailed communication with Schiaparelli all the way to the surface.  The Mars Express data is being returned to Earth now and the analysis is expected to take several hours. Meanwhile, the Trace Gas Orbiter has been firing its engine to reduce its speed from 12,000km/h to 5000km/h. The orbiter is now in eclipse behind Mars but will be back in contact with Earth at around 17:30 UK time. Once contact is re-established, the flight dynamics team can confirm whether TGO is now in orbit around Mars.   Updated at 5.13pm BST    4.42pm BST   There can be no doubt that Nasa has dominated Mars exploration. To date they are the only space agency to successfully land and return science from Mars. The Soviets were the first to receive signals from the surface on Mars in December 1971. Their Mars 3 mission landed on the surface but worked for just 14.5 seconds, sending back a static filled image that defies analysis to this day. Worried that the spacecraft may have been swallowed by Martian quicksand, Nasa programmed their 1976 Viking mission to take an image of the landing pads as soon as they touched down. The image of footpad 3 is therefore the first clear image to be taken from the surface of Mars. Since then, Nasa have successfully landed on Mars six more time. ESAâ€™s 2003 Beagle 2 lander never phoned home, and so was presumed to have crashed. However, in 2015 it was discovered to have landed successfully, but not deployed its antenna.  Updated at 4.44pm BST    4.29pm BST   Meanwhile high above Mars, the Trace Gas Orbiter is still firing its main engine to be captured by Marsâ€™s gravity. The spacecraft is now behind the planet and so out of contact with the ground but this was expected. It will be in view of Earth again at around 17:30 UK time, when flight controllers will be able to confirm whether or not it achieved orbit.     4.20pm BST   So, it looks like we are in this for the long haul. Using the Indian radio telescope was always a long shot and something of an experiment - the Schiaparelli lander was never designed to transmit directly to Earth.  The main route to confirming the landing was always designed to be by analysing the data recorded by the Mars Express spacecraft. That orbiter is now getting ready to point to Earth, rather than at the Schiaparelli lander, and relay its recordings to Earth, where they will be analysed.   Updated at 4.25pm BST    4.15pm BST   Andrea Accomazzo saying that finding the signal in an â€œoceanâ€ of noise is not going to be quick. It is going to take hours, not minutes, to determine if the mission landed successfully.  Updated at 4.16pm BST    4.13pm BST   Still no signal it seems from the surface of Mars. ESA are saying â€œletâ€™s not jump to conclusionsâ€. This might not mean disaster, but it looks increasingly as if we will have to wait for the main recordings from Mars Express to be sent back to Earth and analysed by the flight dynamics team.  Updated at 4.14pm BST    4.08pm BST   The mission flight director is in conversation with the Head of the Communication Office at ESAâ€™s Operations Centre (ESOC). Hopefully some official news will be coming soon.     4.06pm BST   Still waiting for a signal to confirm successful touch down. Schiaparelli was designed to drop the final few metres to the surface. A â€œcrushable structureâ€ rather like the crumple zones on a car was designed to absorb the final shock of touchdown.  Updated at 4.08pm BST    4.02pm BST   ESA report that they are still waiting for a touchdown signal.     4.01pm BST   All the indications are good so far, but there is clearly tension in the ESA main control room as we wait for more signals from Schiaparelli to say what is going on.     3.59pm BST   The Schiaparelli decent module uses a heatshield, a parachute and thrusters to stop itself from crashing into the surface.      3.57pm BST   Good news so far.  #GMRT signal trace has jumped again, which should be the signature of @ESA_EDM parachute deployment #ExoMarsâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016      3.56pm BST   Schiaparelli is descending through the Martian atmosphere. Very tense faces in ESA mission control.     3.54pm BST   Andrea Accomazzo, ESA Spacecraft Operations Manager, says that the atmosphere at ESAâ€™s control centre is â€œvery tenseâ€ as they wait for signals.

The landerâ€™s descent to Mars      2.57pm BST   Referring to the simultaneous landing of Schiaparelli and orbit insertion of the Trace Gas Orbiter, ESAâ€™s ExoMars flight director Michel Denis has just said, â€œThis is the European way: do two things at a time and be successful at both!â€ Itâ€™s a bit early to say that, but you have to admire the confidence.  Updated at 3.03pm BST    2.55pm BST   Good news, the radio telescope in Pune, India, has picked up the Schiaparelli signal. The lander is alive and functioning, and on its final approach to Mars.  .@ESA_EDM ACQUISITION OF SIGNAL at #GMRT! A faint trace on the screen shows us that @ESA_EDM has woken up on schedule #ExoMarsâ€” ESA Operations (@esaoperations) October 19, 2016      2.44pm BST   So far, there is no clear signal from the GMRT from Schiaparelli. ESA say they are not concerned. Picking up the signal from Earth was always an outside chance. The lander will be tracked from the spacecraft in orbit around Mars as original planned.     2.39pm BST   ESA are now hoping to pick up the Schiaparelli landerâ€™s faint radio beacon using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune, India. Schiaparelli was not designed to transmit directly back to Earth, it was supposed to communicate only through the other spacecraft at Mars, so the GMRT may not hear it. But it would be good if it does!     2.28pm BST   The Trace Gas Orbiter, which carried the Schiaparelli lander, is one of the largest satellites to be sent to Mars.  â€œIt is an order of magnitude step up in scientific quality. The sensing of the trace gases is a real fundamental step forward in terms of the global exploration of Mars. It is a big scientific payload. Itâ€™s more like taking the atmospheric instruments that we have on Earth Observation satellites, and taking them all the way to Mars and putting them in orbit around Mars,â€ says David Parker, ESAâ€™s director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration. Designed to sniff out methane in the Martian atmosphere, it could put us on the trail of whether there is life on Mars.  Updated at 2.58pm BST    2.17pm BST   Here we go! The Mars Orbit Insertion Manoeuvre is taking place right now. The Trace Gas Orbiter has arrived at Mars travelling at 12,000km/hour. It needs to shed almost half that speed to be captured by Marsâ€™s gravity. This engine burn is happening now and everything is looking good. This manoeuvre is separate from the Schiaparelli landing.  Updated at 2.20pm BST    2.11pm BST   The animation shows this afternoonâ€™s trajectory of ESAâ€™s spacecraft. Schiaparelli heads directly for the planet, while its â€˜mothershipâ€™ the Trace Gas Orbiter goes into orbit around Mars to begin its scientific mission. The orbit of ESAâ€™s previous mission, Mars Express, is also shown.        2.09pm BST   This afternoon the European Space Agency (ESA) will make a landing attempt on Mars. The Schiaparelli module is due to touch down at 3:48 UK time, although confirmation that all has gone well is likely to take several hours. This is an important moment for ESA. Their previous landing attempt on Mars, back in 2003 with the UK-led Beagle 2 lander did not go as well as hoped. Although the lander reached the surface safely it failed to transmit anything back to Earth. Todayâ€™s landing is designed to show that ESA can now land safely on Mars, in preparation for an ambitious rover mission in 2020 that will look for past or present life on Mars. So, itâ€™s all to play for! Whatever happens today it is going to be an important one for ESA and the worldâ€™s exploration of Mars. Weâ€™ll be covering the events as they happen live.

"STUDY: Infants at Risk from Hidden Fluoride Exposure in Commercial FoodsDerrick Broze The researchers analyzed 360 different samples of 20 different foods ranging from fruits and vegetables, chicken, turkey, beef, and vegetarian dinners. All of the foods tested had detectable amounts of fluoride ranging from .007-4.13 micrograms of fluoride per gram of food. Chicken products had the highest concentrations of fluoride, followed by turkey. The New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation (NYSCOF) reports that the fluoride levels were due to pesticides, fertilizers, soil, groundwater, and/or fluoridated water. The high levels found in the chicken and turkey can be attributed to fluoride-saturated bone dust involved in the process of mechanically separating the meat. Based on the study, consuming more than one serving per day of the high fluoride concentration foods would put children beyond the recommended daily fluoride intake. Babies given high amounts of fluoride can experience white spotted, yellow, brown or pitted teeth, known as dental fluorosis. An excessive intake of fluoride can also lead to acute fluoride toxicity. Since the symptoms of toxicity mimic other common illnesses such as the flu or upset stomach many people may not recognize fluoride as the culprit. The Institute of Medicine recommends children 2 to 3 years old only receive fluoride up to .7 mg from all sources. Even if a parent does give their child less than .7 mg of fluoride through their toothpaste (assuming no more is swallowed) it would be rather difficult to avoid the many other sources of fluoride presently found in the United States, primarily through municipal water supplies. As soon as a parent washes their childs mouth with sink water they have just increased their childs chance of acute fluoride toxicity. Add a soda, canned food, shower, or infant food into the mix (all sources of fluoride) and you have an overexposure to the substance and possibility of acute fluoride toxicity. With the American Dental Association recently recommending fluoride toothpaste to children at the first sight of a tooth, it would seem difficult for a parent to guarantee amount of fluoride their child is receiving from such varied sources. The substances added to municipal water supplies known by the name fluoride are actually a combination of unpurified by products of phosphate mining, namely hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride. In the United States thousands of tons of fluorosilicic acid is recovered from phosphoric acid plants and then used for water fluoridation. During this process the fluoride ion is created. This process of taking waste from the phosphate industry and putting it into drinking water has long been criticized for its effects on human health, and that of the environment. It is well known that water fluoridation has led to dental fluorosis for millions of children. This discoloring of the teeth was called cosmetically objectionable by the Centers for Disease Control. Beyond the cosmetic effect there have been a number of studies indicating health issues ranging from arthritis, brain problems, reduced thyroid or overactive thyroid, kidney problems and bone cancers. While proponents of water fluoridation have long pointed to an apparent drop in tooth decay in fluoridated nations as proof of its validity, those claims have been proven wrong by the World Health Organization. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has stated the fluoride in the water is directly related to better teeth quality however, the WHO released its own study showing that tooth decay rates have dropped in all western nations, whether fluoridated or not.

"Picasso fell in and out of love with the Russian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova in one fierce decade. His portraits trace the collapse. When they meet in 1917, she is an exquisite dark-eyed beauty, en pointe and lithe as an Ingres drawing. Four years later, she has become a monument of neoclassical maternity. By 1927, Picasso has fallen for the teenage Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se Walter, although Olga â€“ now a sharp-featured crag â€“ is the last to know. When she finds out, Picasso paints a post-cubist rant: Olga as a pinched polyhedron with a hyphen-slot mouth and ridiculous hat. Her shining eyes are now dumb black pennies. These images, and more, appear on opposite walls of this show so viewers can look back and forth between them. What strikes are all the usual wonders â€“ Picassoâ€™s stupendous draughtsmanship and super-fertile mind, always inventing new pictorial ideas â€“ but also his sheer volatility. He is sardonic, lustful, exuberant, passionate, satirical, furious. The mood swings from love and camaraderie through humour to outright aggression. This is not Picasso as we generally know him.   If all portraits are caricatures, then Picassoâ€™s portraits of other people are simultaneously caricatures of himself   In fact, the show is a true liberation from art-historical constraints. Its curator, Elizabeth Cowling, urges us to view Picasso as an actual man rather than an avant garde deity. She has assembled nearly 80 portraits from every phase of his career â€“ blue period drinkers, cubist flÃ¢neurs, opulent nudes, caricatures, late self-portraits â€“ in a condensed retrospective that fills the entire ground floor of the National Portrait Gallery. Nor are these pseudo-portraits, like the Tateâ€™s Weeping Woman, lacking any sense of individual presence. Each image has force of personality, no matter how remote from conventional likeness. Picasso is compulsive, constantly redefining the portrait for every sitter. Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se is a lavender moon or a rhythm of interlocking ovals, holding her own bosomy beauty together; the dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler splinters in a fractal proliferation of graphic signs. Picassoâ€™s first partner, Fernande, is broken into wintry planes at the end of the affair, built up in loving smudges at the start. The sneaky vagabond Bibi-la-PurÃ©e looks out from such an overhang of impasto he seems to be literally squinting through the paint. The cultural critic Gustave Coquiot, face an arsenical green leer, backed by a chorus line, is given a real theatre of a portrait. The photographer Lee Miller is yellow and red, crisscross features in all the wrong places, but the scintillating combination conveys her brisk intelligence, regular American teeth and tailored jacket.    â€˜A post-cubist rantâ€™: Woman in a Hat (Olga) by Pablo Picasso, 1935. Photograph: Â© Succession Picasso/DACS London, 2016/PA   Picasso runs all the way from refined likeness to pictogram, metaphor and monstrous lampoon, adapting the style to the sitter. He can draw like Raphael (as he once boasted) yet depict his infant daughter Maya like a plump Peppa Pig. And the crux is always drawing, as this show successfully demonstrates. Picasso the schoolboy cartoonist becomes the quickfire genius encapsulating character and likeness in tight kernels of truth. Take his sketch of Stravinsky â€“ a perfect lesson in draughtsmanship. Here is the composerâ€™s taut mask, inscribed with exacting frown lines, the collar summarily defined by the tie, the glasses two quick arcs that the mindâ€™s eye completes. All of Stravinskyâ€™s acerbity and logicality, his disciplined but almost unthinkable vision, are transcribed in these knife-edge contours. The hair is so sparingly drawn you can count the marks â€“ and whatâ€™s hair but a sheaf of lines? This is Stravinsky distilled, but not mocked. Picasso would have been the greatest caricaturist who ever lived had his imagination stopped at wit. And yet his portraits are often comic. Two grisaille paintings in this show are like frames from some early cartoon. Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se poses nude, breasts a plump sofa, nipples and eyes rhyming like upholstery buttons. Nusch Ã‰luard, a professional acrobat, resembles a particularly spiky Wilma Flintstone.    â€˜Cubism caricatured years laterâ€™: Portrait of Nusch Ã‰luard by Pablo Picasso, 1938. Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS   Picassoâ€™s style here, in 1938, seems to prefigure the great Hanna-Barbera era. And not the least humour lies in the artistâ€™s self-parody. Nuschâ€™s eyes have swapped places on either side of her nose, cubism caricatured years later. Picasso darts restlessly back and forth between styles. A 1954 portrait of his second wife, Jacqueline, her face a white oval framed by a black scarf, conflates early blue period sentimentality with neoclassicism and hints of El Greco. Later, she has become an armour-plated warrior, one fish-eye trained upon the artist in the gloomy interior, the other on the green world through the window. She looks like a post-cubist Minoan. The portrait is dark, claustrophobic, oppressive; its geometric forms are scored into the surface with the brush end. But even these marks remain suavely athletic. Picassoâ€™s signature is in every line of his work, and every line communicates the sheer physical virtuosity of its making.   Related: Pabloâ€™s people: the truth about Picasso's portraits   Jacqueline sat regularly for Picasso, though he also worked from photographs and memory. But what this show reveals is a more startling source for the portraits. Picassoâ€™s paintings talk back and forth across the gallery (it never really feels as if heâ€™s dead), calling each other into being. The coinages in one are ramified in another, shapes are echoed, riffs multiplied, reprised or distorted. Look from neoclassical Olga to polyhedron Olga and you see it is not just the woman but her painted portrait thatâ€™s mocked. And Picasso also rounds on himself: filthy monkey, priapic octogenarian, bony deathâ€™s head with sightless eyes (what lies beyond?) Even the late brothel etchings â€“ Rembrandt badly overexcited, Raphael making love, but not so passionately he has to put down his brushes â€“ are self-satirical, exposing Picassoâ€™s notoriously competitive streak. If all portraits are essentially caricatures, to paraphrase the artist, then Picassoâ€™s portraits of other people are simultaneously caricatures of himself. And that is the revelation of this enthralling show: it humanises Picasso, weaving the story of his life with that of his art in a most intimate way. And he himself saw it as a vast pictorial autobiography. Certainly the subject of his portraits is picture-making â€“ the late takes on VelÃ¡zquez are nothing less than portraits of pictures â€“ as much as the human beings who came before him. But for all his superhuman genius, Picasso turns out to be just as mortal. Philippe Parreno, French film-installationist extraordinaire, has transformed the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern into a subaqueous tank. Or perhaps it is an isle full of noises. Inflatable fish drift intermittently through the air, mesmerising the crowd at the door; screens descend from the heavens to audiences sprawled on carpets below. Lights shimmer, murmurs rise and fall through the air.    â€˜Art as perpetual evolutionâ€™: Philippe Parrenoâ€™s Anywhen at Tate Modernâ€™s Turbine Hall. Photograph: Guy Bell/ Rex/ Shutterstock   Nina Conti, onscreen, ponders the universe, uttering a stream of intergalactic thoughts about temporal dilation, semiconductors and the space-time continuum. Her face swims in a pool of limelight. Like Prospero, she seems to be dreaming, talking of tides, infinity and the strange creatures of the sea. One floats into view, eye like a mouth, tentacles clasping like hands. The squid is connected to us, yet utterly alien. Parrenoâ€™s vision is appealingly unobtrusive: Conti quietly breathy, the ambient fluctuations controlled by the infinitely various motions of micro-organisms wired up to software. Slow-flowing, intriguing, this mysterious environment makes a shadow-play of spectators, as well as an audience, measuring their time in the gallery by changing all the time. It is art as perpetual evolution.

"Have you called your daughter by your wifeâ€™s name or your son by his brotherâ€™s name? Have you misplaced your car keys or forgotten where you parked at the mall?If you worry these might be signs of significant memory loss or the early stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, which causes a slow deterioration in memory and reasoning skills, fear not, experts said.Not all memory lapses are created equal.By the age of 45, the average person experiences a decline in memory, Dr. Gary W. Small, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an email.Forgetting facts or events over time, absent-mindedness and incorrectly recalling a detail are among six â€œnormalâ€ memory problems that should not cause concern, according to the Center for Brain-Mind Medicine at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital in Boston.When people do experience normal memory decline related to aging, 85 percent of their complaints involve recalling peopleâ€™s names, Dr. Small said.You can blame multitasking for overloading your mind. Think about the ways we are driven to distraction with smartphones and social media, for instance.â€œWhenever our brains are taxed by multiple demands, cognitive â€˜slipsâ€™ or errors are more likely to occur due to a concept called memory â€˜interference,â€™ â€ Carrington Wendell, a neuropsychology specialist at the Anne Arundel Medical Group in Annapolis, Md., said in an email.Name mix-ups are also more likely to occur when the two names share the same beginning, middle or ending, such as Bob and Ben or Dave and Jake, and are the same sex and similar age, she added.Stress and lack of sleep can worsen the symptoms, Dr. Small said, but the side effects of medications, infections, thyroid abnormalities and depression can also impair memory.Other possible causes include hypertension and diabetes, Dr. Thomas M. Wisniewski, director of the Center for Cognitive Neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center, said in an interview.Dr. Wisniewski said it is one thing to forget where you left your car keys, but it could be something more serious if you donâ€™t know what the keys are for or how to use them. Getting lost in familiar places can also be a warning sign, he said.Look out for instances where you or a loved one is unable to correctly name things and give them alternative names, Ann Norwich, director of the adult gerontology nurse practitioner program at York College of Pennsylvania in York, Pa., said in an email. For example, instead of saying the mail was on the counter, a person with serious memory issues might say it was on the plate or in the oven.â€œAdditional signs of memory impairment include irritability or even explosiveness when questioned about their memory,â€ she added. A person with dementia may create stories and become suspicious of others and withdraw from friends and family.The Alzheimerâ€™s Association has a list of warning signs of the disease, including poor judgment and memory loss that disrupts daily life.Dr. Wisniewski said it was rare that a person below the age of 60 would exhibit the symptoms of dementia, unless there was a family history.The risk for dementia is 10 percent in people 65 years or older and approaches 50 percent by age 85, Dr. Small said.Consulting with a health care professional is necessary to tell the difference between normal aging and dementia, he added. Tests include reviewing the history and nature of the symptoms, a physical exam, often a brain scan to rule out strokes and a mental exam to determine the degree and nature of the cognitive impairment, he said.Dr. Norwich noted that â€œdementia is insidious.â€â€œFamilies adapt to the changes in their loved ones without recognizing that there may be something amiss,â€ she said, adding that sometimes it is only in retrospect that relatives recognize that memory loss has been building over time and that their loved one may have dementia.",1

"Western Military Monitors Turn Up in Eastern UkraineTony Cartalucci The observers who include four Germans and citizens of the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Sweden were sent under the Vienna Document on military transparency and included no OSCE monitors, according to the Vienna-based organization. They were accompanied by Ukrainian military officers. That the team members, all drawn from NATO member states, are not actual OSCE monitors, raises doubts over the legitimacy of their mission. NATO has decisively sided with the unelected regime currently occupying Kiev. The objectivity therefore of monitors drawn from NATO states presents an immense conflict of interest. Just as other international organizations, including the United Nations itself, are used by the West as cover for covert extraterritorial operations, it appears that the OSCE Vienna Document on military transparency has been abused in an effort to support Kievs unelected regime and its on going armed operations in the east of Ukraine. While the West attempts to use the capture of these so-called international monitors to their rhetorical advantage, the propaganda value is minimal. Had these been real monitors carrying out an objective assessment within the mandate of the Vienna Document on military transparency, the backlash from across the West would have been enormous. It is clear, however, that these monitors were most likely using the Vienna Document as cover for a NATO intelligence assessment. Leading the rather muted propaganda campaign is the US State Departments Voice of America, which stated in their article, Captured European Monitors in Ukraine say They are Well, that: With armed rebels watching as they spoke, the leader of the monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, German Colonel Axel Schneider, assured reporters in Slovyansk they were in good health. Voice of Americas rhetoric, calling NATO officers European monitors, strains credibility. Calling anti-fascist eastern Ukrainians pro-Russia insurgents also presents a factual discrepancy an insurgent being defined as a person who fights against an established government or authority, and the regime currently occupying Kiev being neither an established government nor an authority. One must wonder how the Western media would react had it been Russian military monitors captured in Kiev claiming they were operating under the auspices of the OSCE Vienna Document. Irrevocable Damage to Wests International Institutions Just as the West has done with institutions and organizations like the United Nations in nations like Iraq, Libya, and Syria, their use of the OSCE as cover for military officers belonging to the overtly biased NATO alliance undermines utterly any perceived impartiality or objectivity of the OSCEs mission in Ukraine, or overall. The abuse of these so-called international institutions openly being leveraged by Western special interests endangers any legitimate work taking place within them, thus hindering possible avenues to peacefully resolve the current conflict in Ukraine. And even as the captured Western officers themselves attempt to defuse tensions regarding their presence in eastern Ukraine and their subsequent capture, the West has mobilized its media machine to further raise tensions and the possibility of a less than peaceful resolution. Reports from Reuters and updates from the US State Departments Voice of America continue to portray the captured NATO officers as monitors, with Reuters in an article titled, Open arms and smile fail to protect German colonel in Ukraine, claiming: The irrelevant side-note is meant to humanize the NATO officers and further demonize their captors. Reuters fails to define just what Schneider and his team were doing in eastern Ukraine, claiming only that they were doing verification work. The opacity of the mission and the refusal of the respective governments from which the teams members are drawn, to explain their presence and objectives in Ukraine, only further adds to suspicions that they were indeed only using the OSCE as cover for a more insidious agenda. A genuine OSCE monitoring mission to Ukraine, considering the broad membership of the OSCEwhich includes the Russian Federation, might include members from nations backing not only the unelected regime in Kiev, but also those backing anti-fascist Ukrainians in the eastern and southern regions of the country. That all the team members for the mission originated from NATO countries, many of which have in fact arrayed military assets against both eastern Ukrainians and neighboring Russia in recent weeks, indicates not only an immense conflict of interest, but obvious resulting improprieties. And while the OSCE does indeed include the Russian Federation within its membership, its partnership with NATO appears to take precedence. On the OSCEs official website,a page describing its partnership with NATOstates: Of NATOs military intervention in Kosovo it would claim: It would stand to reason that the OSCEs inclusion of Russia among its membership is a symbolic gesture, and the organization itself is but another appendage of NATO and therefore an extension of its regional and global agenda. It is, if anything, reprising its role as facilitator of NATO vis--vis Russia, just as it had done in Kosovo.

"Star Spurs center Tim Duncan has issued a public apology for his 'unacceptable, inexcusable behavior' last Saturday night following a preseason loss to the Orlando Magic, saying that frustration and disappointment with his low-scoring, six-rebound performance caused 'ten years' worth of unexpressed emotions to burst out of me like like something I don't even know what.' An 'agitated' Duncan responds to reporters' questions in a brusque tone of voice at a slightly elevated volume. No criminal charges, police reports, or even complaints have been filed against Duncan, who was last seen leaving the Alamodome after giving what reporters are terming 'mildly animated' answers to their post-game questions at a 'slightly elevated' volume. 'I simply lost control during my post-game comments, and I did not give the press the full half-hour they are entitled to,' said Duncan, who is on record as calling the Spurs' play during the game 'bad,' 'real bad,' 'awful,' and 'very, very bad indeed' several times over the course of the 28 minutes he spent with reporters. 'Anyone who knows me knows I never use language like that. I can only ask the city of San Antonio to forgive me for my outburst and give me a second chance.' 'I was angry,' Duncan added. 'I even felt mad. I never want to go through that again.' Duncan claims that, after speaking to reporters, he was filled with a level of emotion that caused his memory to become unclear. However, Duncan is fairly certain that he turned away from reporters after insufficiently thanking them for the interview, walked to the parking lot with unusual briskness, and climbed into his car in a blatantly agitated fashion. Witnesses' accounts bear out Duncan's version of events, with several onlookers saying Duncan 'slammed' the door of his 1992 Buick LeSabre closed before driving off. Spurs guard Tony Parker, whose car was near Duncan's, denied rumors that Duncan was muttering grumpily to himself, but said Duncan did exhale audibly twice while getting his car keys out. 'Looking back on it, I think he was sighing in a frustrated or even exasperated manner,' Parker said. 'I thought about saying something, but I didn't know what. I'd never seen him like that. Frankly, I was a little scared.' 'I should not have driven in that condition,' said Duncan, who has implored the children of San Antonio not to emulate his actions or regard them as 'cool.' 'I know better than to operate a motor vehicle while upset or in a highly emotional state of mind, but I did it anyway. I only wish I had exercised the self-restraint to let it go at that.' Traffic cameras tracked Duncan traveling from the Alamodome at up to seven miles per hour over the speed limit, twice driving through yellow lights, to a convenience store near his home, where the store's security cameras show him purchasing highly caffeinated beverages and several unhealthy snacks. A clerk at the store says Duncan consumed three of the soft drinks in his car while listening to barely audible music on his car's radio before driving off several minutes later. Duncan's mid-'90s four-door sedan was found in the parking lot of his nondescript apartment building Sunday morning, having impacted a tree at what insurance company investigators say was an 'extremely low' rate of speed, inflicting almost $140 worth of damage to the car during what they say seems to be an abortive attempt to park while slightly jittery from an excess of mild sugar stimulants. 'I do not wish to discuss that at this time,' Duncan said. 'I'm just glad no one was hurt while I was experimenting with Coke, or Pepsi, or root beer, or whatever it was. I just remember going into my apartment, turning on the television, unblocking Showtime, and calling up a few girls from church to say 'hello' and 'how are you doing.' Frankly I'm mortified, and in light of my actions, I wouldn't blame them for being cross with me in return. I was brought up to respect women, not to place telephone calls to them at what might possibly be well past their bedtimes.' Duncan recalls nothing else until 9:30 the next morning, when he woke up two hours late, unshaven, and dressed in unusually brightly colored clothing. Duncan immediately contacted the police, and was relieved to find he had in fact broken no laws. Duncan has assigned himself 120 hours of community service working in hospitals, neighborhood improvement projects, and on highway-beautification crews for his 'reckless endangerment' of the people of San Antonio. 'I promise you,' the dry-eyed Duncan said in an unusually well-modulated voice, 'you will never see anything like that from me again.' ",0

It seeks to reintroduce her to voters, ostensibly by highlighting lesser-known aspects of her work on behalf of families and children.THE MESSAGE Titled â€œAlways,â€ the minute-long commercial begins with home movie footage of Mrs. Clinton as a toddler, teetering down steps with a grown-upâ€™s help and waving to the camera with a toothy smile. â€œShe would grow up to be one of the most recognizable women in the world,â€ a male narrator says, over now-familiar pictures of Mrs. Clinton, some alongside her husband. â€œBut less well-known are the causes that have been at the center of her life.â€ The ad cites her work â€œhelping get disabled kids out of the shadows and into their local schoolsâ€; bringing â€œreform to some of the poorest schools in the nationâ€; working â€œwith Republicans and Democratsâ€ to enact the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program, which â€œtoday is covering eight million kidsâ€; and, as secretary of state, â€œworking to end the trafficking of women and girls.â€ Acknowledging, ever so wispily, that â€œthrough the years there have been challenges, setbacks,â€ the ad says one thing has never changed: â€œHelping children has been a cause of her life, and it always will be.â€THE IMPACT The ad is one of three Mrs. Clinton began running on Thursday in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. She is following the playbook that President Obama used in 2012, trying to define herself and, with speeches attacking Donald J. Trump, define her opponent too, even before they each officially claim their nominations.THE TAKEAWAY What is said is important, like the reference to Mrs. Clintonâ€™s bipartisan work in Washington, a strong signal as she goes up against the my-way-or-the-highway Republican candidate, Mr. Trump. But what is shown is what matters most: Photos and video clips serve to humanize Mrs. Clinton as a motherly figure, hugging young people, crouching down with little children; as a protector, standing alongside military officers; and as a hard worker, toting piles of law books, speaking out, or descending from a government plane alone in the middle of the night.Changing channels â€¦Mr. Trumpâ€™s more insulting remarks about women have proved irresistible satire fodder for his Republican opponents and for Priorities USA, the Democratic â€œsuper PACâ€ allied with Mrs. Clinton. Now, Florida Democrats are giving it a try, but with a new, â€œHappy Daysâ€ aesthetic. The group has made four different ads, with sepia-tone titles, faux film flicker, and a singsong narrator who would sound at home on a furniture-size tube television in the Eisenhower administration. Each offers a different â€œFatherâ€™s Day tipâ€ culled from Mr. Trumpâ€™s utterances. No. 4: â€œBe as uninvolved with your children as possible!â€Of all the insults hurled at Mr. Trump, one seemed to get under his skin the most: Senator Marco Rubioâ€™s suggestion that his hands were unusually small. Mr. Trumpâ€™s response spawned a thousand memes, and now even a super PAC: â€œAmericans Against Insecure Billionaires with Tiny Hands.â€ While joke political groups routinely file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, this one actually cut and broadcast a 60-second ad in Washington, D.C., with actors demanding the release of Mr. Trumpâ€™s hand measurements, as a doll-size hand is shown struggling to manage everyday tasks â€” like pushing the nuclear button.43: Days since the Trump campaign ran its last television ad.$17 MILLION: Amount spent by Priorities USA on Mrs. Clintonâ€™s behalf in the same time period.$8.5 MILLION: Amount spent by Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign in four days this week.",1
"Teneo, the corporate consulting firm with ties to the Clintons, filed papers to sue Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist and chairman of a Donald J. Trump super PAC, for defamation and breach of contract over comments made about the firm in recent days.According to a summons filed in New York State Supreme Court on Monday, the company said it would seek $10 million in damages from Mr. Rollins, who ran Ronald Reaganâ€™s campaign in 1984 and now makes regular appearances on television, often on Fox News.During a Friday appearance on â€œLou Dobbs Tonightâ€ on Fox Business, Mr. Rollins, a senior adviser at Teneo until this year, made comments cited by the company as defamatory and a breach of its contract because they included â€œconfidential information,â€ according to the summons.The company also cited Mr. Rollinsâ€™s statements to The New York Times for an article about the firm published last month.Mr. Rollins said in an interview on Tuesday that he shared no confidential information and that he was in discussions with his lawyers about filing a countersuit against the company.â€œFor a strategy company, it shows that theyâ€™re not very smart,â€ Mr. Rollins said. â€œObviously Iâ€™m not going to roll over and play dead. Iâ€™m an old fighter. If they want to go at it, weâ€™ll go at it. They can depose me and I can depose them.â€Threats of legal action in response to public statements and articles have been a notable feature of the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has frequently told attendees at his rallies that he would like to change the countryâ€™s libel laws to more easily go after media organizations.The summons sent by Teneo to Mr. Rollins on Monday was a prominent instance of a defamation claim that actually proceeded into the courts.Teneo is a sprawling international company that provides strategic advice to chief executives from some of the countryâ€™s largest companies. It has been the subject of Republican congressional scrutiny related to its ties to former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.Emails obtained and released by WikiLeaks have detailed some of the relationships between Teneo clients, the Clinton Foundation and Douglas J. Band, a Teneo founder who is also a top aide to Mr. Clinton.It was not clear which statement by Mr. Rollins prompted the suit.But he said in the interview on Tuesday, after his television appearance, he received a cease-and-desist letter from Teneo on Saturday citing his comments on Mr. Dobbsâ€™s show about Huma Abedin. Ms. Abedin, a close adviser to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, briefly worked for Teneo in 2012.During the television appearance, Mr. Rollins and Mr. Dobbs discussed the revelation, hours before, that federal agents were inspecting newly discovered emails possibly connected to the investigation into Mrs. Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server. The emails were on a computer shared by Ms. Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, a disgraced former New York congressman who is the subject of an unrelated federal investigation into his sending of lewd pictures.Mr. Rollins suggested that Ms. Abedin may have used the same computer during her time at Teneo. He also referred to a policy, reported by The Times, that was instituted by the company last year to remove old emails from its computers.â€œSo my sense is, she probably thought whatever she had on her computer was gone,â€ he said on the show. â€œI think this may have been the outside computer that she used at home, or what have you.â€A spokesman for Teneo declined to comment on the lawsuit. The company has said that Mr. Rollins was fired for â€œegregiously breachingâ€ his employment contract. Mr. Rollins disputes that characterization of his departure from the firm after four years.Mr. Rollins said he received the summons on Monday evening as he left his apartment building on East 66th Street in Manhattan to go to the Fox studios for a television appearance. He saw a black sport utility vehicle and mistakenly assumed the man who stepped out was his driver.In fact, the man was serving him with the summons. â€œI said, â€˜Iâ€™m going to Fox,â€™â€ Mr. Rollins recalled saying. â€œHe said, â€˜No, youâ€™re going to court.â€™â€",1
"by Ming Jinwei BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Central banks of Western countries have fought back to contain the Greek crisis by setting up a 750 -billion-euro (1-trillion- dollar) stabilizing fund and jointly injecting liquidity into financial markets. SETTING UP 'MONSTER' FUND Finance ministers of European Union (EU) nations announced earlier Monday they would set up a big stabilizing fund to stop the Greek debt crisis from spreading to other countries. The decision was taken after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations. Under the plan, the EU will provide 60 billion euros, while eurozone countries will try to secure another 440 billion euros through bilateral backing. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been playing a more active role in tackling the Greek debt crisis, will provide 250 billion euros. Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after the meeting 'we are placing considerable sums in the interest of stability in Europe.' Meanwhile, Olli Rehn, EU's monetary affairs commissioner, said the decision to set up the stability fund proved the EU countries would do everything possible to defend their shared currency. EU finance ministers said in a joint statement released after the meeting that the stability fund would be in place to 'safeguard financial stability.' Late last year, the Greek government announced in a surprising move that its budgetary problems were much more serious than the previous government had acknowledged. Athens has been under severe fiscal pressure as government spending expanded to stimulate the economy and to meeting social security claims while tax revenues shrank during the sharp economic downturn. Greece inched closer to 'bankruptcy' after international rating agencies downgraded its sovereign debt ratings and bond market investors pushed up its borrowing costs to unsustainable high levels. The EU and the IMF announced a joint rescue plan of 110 billions euros on May 2 to help dampen fears about the Greek government defaulting on its debt, but the plan failed to assuage market fears and more and more believe the Greek debt crisis could well spread to other weaker eurozone economies like Portugal and Spain. Analysts believe the latest 'monster' fund was meant to prove to the market that the EU and the IMF were taking credible measures to contain the Greek debt crisis, and restore market confidence. CENTRAL BANKS' JOINT INTERVENTION Meanwhile, central banks of the euro zone, the United States, Canada, Britain, Switzerland and Japan are joining hands to inject fresh liquidity into the financial system. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced in a drastic move that it would start purchasing eurozone government bonds to support battered government debt markets. The ECB decision was seen by many as 'unusual.' The ECB is banned from directly buying government bonds so as not to subsidize those over-spending eurozone countries, but it can make asset purchases on the secondary market. Even though the ECB did not specify how much or what kind of government bonds it would buy, the decision itself was compared to a 'nuclear option' by some economists. With the ECB support, government bond prices would stop falling and give those beleaguered eurozone countries precious time to secure enough funds to meet their debt obligations. The ECB has resisted calls for a greater role in containing the Greek debt crisis in the past months, fearing its involvement would create so-called moral hazard and harm its primary efforts to maintain overall price stability. Other central banks announced they would inject dollar funds into the financial markets. Spooked investors have become more and more cautious about giving away their money and a liquidity squeeze witnessed during the financial crisis resurfaced, though to a much lesser extent. The Federal Reserve of the United States said its move was in response to the reemergence of 'strains' in financial markets in Europe. MIXED RESULTS The EU-IMF stability fund and the joint intervention of Western central banks are welcomed by many. The Group of 20 praised these measures. The news was also well received by the financial markets. Japanese stocks rebounded from heavy losses last week and the hard-hit euro bounced back a little to other major currencies. Usually, it will be a long process to restoring market confidence and the battle to contain the Greek debt crisis could stretch longer than many anticipated. The EU, the IMF and Western central banks have to take measures to prevent the Greek crisis from escalating into a full-blown pan-Europe sovereign debt mess, but the fundamental problem of the current crisis is about how eurozone countries could regain their economic competitiveness. Besides, it seemed that eurozone countries had to spend months narrowing their differences and making a collective decision. This shows that the euro zone, which came into being in 1999, has much to do to improve its internal consultations in times of crisis. ",1
"Big Biotech Seeks to Rule EUHeather Callaghan DuPont and Dow Chemical are poised to crash the EU with their co-created genetically modified 1507 Pioneer corn as well. A corporatocracy didnt just occur out the blue, however. Its potentially being handed to biotech by the European Environmental Ministers with a law that sounds like a national ban (but actually isnt.) Get this:according to Stop the Crop, the newproposal gives biotech companies the power to decide whether a national ban is permitted or not. Gee, which way will biotech decide? Discussion for the proposal takes place tomorrow, May 28th. For more information, Stop the Crop is referring people to Friends of the Earth Europes short document entitled: A poisoned chalice. Why the Greek Opt-out proposal for GM crops will do more harm than good. Sustainable Pulse explains A poisoned chalice this way: The new law is being promoted as a way to give governments more sovereignty over decisions on whether to ban GM crops. However, the current proposals give biotech companies the legal right to decide whether a ban should be allowed. If companies refuse, governments are forced to fall back on vague, non-scientific legal grounds upon which to ban GM crops, opening the door to legal challenges Adrian Bebb of FOE Europesaid: It is an affront to democracy that companies like Monsanto will be given legal status in any decision to ban their products. Governments must be able to ban unwanted and risky GM crops without needing thepermission of the companies who profit from them. For more than 15 years national governments have fought against new GM crops and strongly defended their rights to ban them. This proposal is a poisoned chalice that fails to give member states the solid legal grounds to ban genetically modified crops. The United States parallels the EU in a similar regard. Just on the heels of Vermont passing the first state GMO food labeling law, the DARK Act of 2014 (actual name is Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act) threatens to nullify any past and future state laws regarding GMO labeling and bans.

"EU Lifts Oil Embargo on Syria - Buys Directly from Al QaedaWestern media hails EU oil deal as potential game changer, despite admitting Al Qaeda holds oil fields. It was recently reported that the European Union would be lifting its oil embargo on Syria, in an effort to help fund what it calls rebels operating there. In the Associated Press article, EU lifts Syria oil embargo to bolster rebels, it states: The European Union on Monday lifted its oil embargo on Syria to provide more economic support to the forces fighting to oust President Bashar Assads regime. The decision will allow for crude exports from rebel-held territory, the import of oil and gas production technology, and investments in the Syrian oil industry, the EU said in a statement. A recent TIME article titled, Syrias Opposition Hopes to Win the War by Selling Oil, reports: On paper, the E.U.s idea seemed straightforward. Without an embargo, European companies can now legally begin importing barrels of oil directly from rebel groups, which have seized several oil fields in recent months, mostly around the eastern area of Deir Ezzor. That would provide the opposition with its first reliable source of income since the revolt erupted in Feb. 2011, and in theory hasten the downfall of Bashar Assads regime, by giving rebels the means to run skeletal local governments and consolidate their control. As part of the decision, the E.U. ministers also agreed to export technical equipment, insure the rebels shipments of oil and invest in the rebel oil businesses. Before the war, Syria earned about $3.6 billion a year exporting oil and gas to Europe, with its biggest customers in Germany and Italy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Syrias main oilfields are in the eastern provinces of Deir al-Zour and Hassakeh, which both border Iraq. Just as in Libya, the West is wasting no time in despoiling Syrias resources, with the pillaging beginning long before the war even reaches a definitive conclusion. But in addition to the overt looting of Syrias resources, there is an added complication.TIME also reports: Still, analysts warn that the plan is deeply flawedand in fact, that the E.U.s decision could intensify the violence in Syria, by setting up a deadly competition for control of a resource that has languished amid two years of grinding civil war. And indeed, this deadly competition has already been taking place, as Al Qaedas al-Nusra front in Syria has been overrunning civilian populations, government positions, and local militias alike across Syrias oil-rich region. In fact, TIMEs itself admits that: Complicating the issue is the fact that several of the rebel-held oil fields are believed to be under the control of Jabhat al-Nusra, which has declared its allegiance to al-Qaeda. TIME concedes that several oil fields are held by Al Qaeda;however, other reports across the Western media indicate most, if not all rebel-held oil fields are under Al Qaedas control. Elsewhere, they [al-Nusra] have seized government oil fields, put employees back to work and now profit from the crude they produce. Additionally: In the oil-rich provinces of Deir al-Zour and Hasaka, Nusra fighters have seized government oil fields, putting some under the control of tribal militias and running others themselves. In Reuters Rebels battle with tribesmen over oil in Syrias east, it is admitted that: Islamist rebels are clashing with tribesmen in eastern Syria as struggles over the regions oil facilities break out in the power vacuum left by civil war, activists said on Saturday. The fighting, which started in late March and lasted 10 days, was part of a new pattern of conflict between tribal groups and the Nusra Front, said a report from the Observatory, a British-based group which opposes Syrias government and draws information from a network of activists in the country. The Reuters article had forewarned: The incentive for disputes over lucrative resources may be increased by plans by the European Union to lift an embargo on Syrian oil, which would make it easier to sell. In other words, the EUs announcement while lining the pockets of big-oil, is sowing increased chaos, violence, and death across oil-rich regions of Syria, compounding an already catastrophic humanitarian disaster of the Wests own creation. It is also clear that Al Qaedas al-Nusra front is the opposition the EU plans to buy the oil from, as there are no other opposition groups across the country to speak of according even to the New York Times, and more specifically, none besides al-Nusra holding significant ground in Syrias oil fields. The EU is openly preparing to do business directly with Al Qaeda, in a direct bid to bolster their control over territory they now occupy, and to overthrow the secular government of Syria in an unprecedented sectarian bloodbath. While many may claim the EUs policy is merely yet another manifestation of the corruption and incompetence that are hallmarks of the failed supranational bloc, it was revealed as early as 2007 that the West sought to intentionally arm and fund sectarian extremists, including Al Qaeda, to overthrow the Syrian government in just such a sectarian bloodbath. In 2007 a full 4 years before the 2011 Arab Spring would begin Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in his New Yorker article titled, The Redirection: Is the Administrations new policy benefiting our enemies in the war on terrorism? would state specifically (emphasis added): To undermine Iran, which is predominantly Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East. In Lebanon, the Administration has coperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite organization that is backed by Iran. The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda. Clearly then, it is no accident that Al Qaeda has the weapons and cash to dominate the so-called opposition, nor a mystery as to how theyve managed to seize much of Syrias oil fields. It is also no accident that these very terrorists now stand to gain immensely by selling stolen oil to the European Union, in a bid to further increase their strength, capabilities, and reach, in an otherwise so-far unsuccessful bid to overthrow the Syrian government. The EU and their US and British allies, now have yet another deep scar that will permanently disfigure their reputation, legitimacy, and international standing ad infinitum. For the people of the West, it is imperative that they identify the corporate-financier interests truly driving this conspiracy against the Syrian people and both boycott and permanently replace these interests. If not, they will inevitably, and in many cases already are, turning their attention, exploitation, and rackets inward onto their own.

"In an effort to advance what they have repeatedly stated is the key element of their agenda, the nations gay straw men marched on the nations capital Monday to advocate for the right to marry animals, sources confirmed. If men can marry men, and women can marry women, then why shouldnt I be allowed to enter into holy matrimony with a member of the animal kingdom? said a straw man from Falmouth, MA, who explained that he should be permitted to wed whomever or whatever he pleases given that the legislative gates have been opened, a sentiment expressed by thousands of his fellow straw men as they hoisted signs that read Equal Rights For Interspecies Partners and Marriage For All Mammals Now. In the years since my state legalized same-sex marriage, Ive discovered that my emotional and physical needs cannot be fulfilled by another human, and it is clear that lying with either a cat, dog, or sheep is what I now want. We believe gay marriage has set an irrefutable legal precedent for this behavior, and we intend to act on it. At press time, demonstrators were reportedly shouting that they wouldnt simply settle for the right to marry their siblings or any number of partners, noting that their ultimate goal was to marry an animal of their choosing or, perhaps, an inanimate object.

"Andre Johnson called Tennessee Coach Mike Mularkey, asking if they could talk Monday morning. After 14 N.F.L. seasons, Johnson, the receiver with more catches than any other active player, had made up his mind: time to retire.â€œHe said heâ€™s been contemplating it for weeks and his heart was not in it,â€ Mularkey said. â€œThis is a tough business to be in when your heartâ€™s not in it.â€Johnson, 35, was nowhere to be found on Monday, apparently not ready to publicly discuss his decision. He did not release a statement through his agent or the team.That did not prevent Mularkey from trying to talk Johnson into staying. The Titans had signed Johnson to a two-year deal the day they reported for training camp, paying him the veteran minimum for this season with the prospect of a bigger payday in 2017. Johnson started four of the eight games he played this season but had not caught a pass in the last three.Johnson, a seven-time Pro Bowler, spent the first 12 seasons of his career with the Houston Texans, who made him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2003 draft out of the University of Miami. Tennessee was his third team in three seasons, after Johnson spent 2015 with the Indianapolis Colts.Johnson finishes his career with statistics that rank him among the best receivers in N.F.L. history. He is ninth with 1,062 catches and 10th with 14,185 receiving yards, and he also had 70 touchdowns. Johnson led the N.F.L. in catches in 2006 (103) and 2008 (115).

North-leading Vikings (5-2) their second straight loss.Cutler, who completed 20 of 31 passes, played well in his return from a sprained right thumb. Howard easily surpassed his previous high of 118 yards, Alshon Jeffery got his first touchdown reception of the season, and Chicago outgained Minnesota 403 yards to 258.Bradford, playing behind a porous line, finished 23 of 37 for 228 yards.BROWNS ACQUIRE A TOP PATRIOTS LINEBACKER The winless Cleveland Browns were perceived to be sellers, not buyers, at the N.F.L.â€™s trading deadline, set for Tuesday at 4 p.m. They proved that theory wrong by acquiring the Pro Bowl linebacker Jamie Collins from the New England Patriots in exchange for a conditional third-round draft choice, bolstering a defense that has allowed the most yards in the league.The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Collins was a second-round selection by New England in 2013. He is earning $485,928 in the final year of his rookie contract, but negotiations for a new deal had stalled.Collins, 27, led the Patriots in tackles in each of the last two seasons, starting every defensive snap in their Super Bowl victory in February 2015. He has 285 tackles, 10 Â½ sacks and five interceptions in 50 career games, making him Clevelandâ€™s most accomplished linebacker.ROETHLISBERGER TAKES PART IN PRACTICE Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger practiced in a limited capacity, just two weeks after having surgery to repair the meniscus in his left knee.Roethlisberger, who did not speak to reporters after practice, was initially expected to miss four to six weeks after the operation, but he could return earlier than expected.Jimmy Butler scored 22 points, Dwyane Wade had 12, and the Chicago Bulls improved to 3-0 by beating the Nets, 118-88, at Barclays Center.The Bulls had seven players in double figures, with Wade the last to reach the milestone.

"The Preppers Conundrum: To Bug in or Bug Out? (Pt. 1)Tess Pennington Factors to Consider Making the decision to evacuate or hunker down are both unique to one another. Moreover, both are extremely stressful situations that involve a lot of forethought and planning in order for a smooth transition to take place. Obviously, wed all like to hunker down with our supplies and ride out a storm, but there are factors to consider in the bug in or bug out decision making process: The situations listed above will cause a shift in our everyday lives. No longer can we run out to pick up necessary items at a store, go to the hospital for medical care, or rely on emergency responders to keep us safe. Further, supply trucks will be delayed in resupplying necessary food, water and survival needs, or the government may have felt it necessary to intervene and have a military presence in the city or town that you live. In some cases, banks will shut down making it impossible for you to access your hard earned money. Inevitably, in times such as these, the survival of our family will rest upon our shoulders, and if we find ourselves in an environment that isnt conducive to our way of life and we are unable to thrive, then we must make the choice to leave the environment or stand firm and defend it. But before that choice is made, weigh your options carefully (including your risks and odds at surviving). What it all comes down to is which scenario will you be safest in and thrive the most. It All Comes Down to Two Questions The above-listed events and factors can cause extreme upheavals in our lifestyles and communities; therefore, we must take these into consideration. To evaluate whether or not to bug in or out, you need to ask yourself two important questions: 1. Do you have everything that you and your family need to survive? Ultimately, whether or not you decide to bug in or bug out you take the chance of being on your own for an extended period of time. It could be 2 weeks, a month or longer and its all on you. The place that you decide to survive in needs to have an adequate amount of supplies to carry your family through. As well, thought should be put into longer term survival needs in case the disaster becomes long term. Keep in mind that with respect to major natural disasters, water sources are usually questionable following a disaster, fuel is scare, shelf stable food supplies are limited, supply trucks are delayed, flooding and damage to homes could be a problem, and home invasions are also at the forefront. If you dont have the supplies, tools and skills needed to live on your own for at least a two week period or longer, then you should consider finding shelter elsewhere. Check out the 52 weeks to Preparedness to get ideas and lists of what preps you need for short and long term emergencies. Note: To determine whether or not you are adequately supplied, consider simulating an off grid weekend and live off of your preps to see how well equipped you are. This will help you find any holes in your preparedness supplies and areas where you need to bulk up. Moreover, the climate you live in could play a part in your decision to bug in or out. If you hunker in place in an off-grid environment and have no fuel or supplies to maintain your body temperature, or have to leave your home and bug out on foot in the dead of winter, you could be setting yourself up for hypothermia and frostbite. Therefore, as part of your preparedness supplies, ensure that you have appropriate footwear and outerwear. 2. Will you be safe until a recovery period occurs? Another important consideration when deciding to bug in is that history has shown that following a disaster social breakdowns typically occur. If the event is severe enough, the government may decide that martial law is the only recourse and legally has the right to confiscate guns, thus taking away your ability to protect yourself. If you live in a highly populated area, where crime waves and looting could pose a problem, then this could leave you and your family vulnerable to home invasions and a family member could be injured. Further, you need to really examine whether your home is a safe place to bug in. Is the home far enough off the street to prevent flooding? Is your home built on a solid foundation? Can you defend it if attacked? Do you have a strong local community support (i.e., a well- organized neighborhood watch program, church outreach programs, or friends and relatives that live nearby)? As you can see, there is a lot to think about when making the decision to bug in or bug out. Population density, community support, probability of natural disasters, etc. are all factors to strongly consider. Dangers occur in both situations if you arent properly prepared. Therefore, it is essential that you make an informed decision. In the next part of this series we will discuss the bug in option of this preppers conundrum and what will be needed in order to thrive. Tess Pennington is the author of The Preppers Cookbook: 300 Recipes to Turn Your Emergency Food into Nutritious, Delicious, Life-Saving Meals. When a catastrophic collapse cripples society, grocery store shelves will empty within days. But if you follow this books plan for stocking, organizing and maintaining a proper emergency food supply, your family will have plenty to eat for weeks, months or even years. ",0
"Defense Report Sees Environmental Warfare, Corporate Armies and Robot TakeoverDaniel Taylor An updated version of the report was published on June 30, 2014. Titled Global Strategic Trends out to 2045, the report outlines a future in which globalization limits countries freedom of action, alternative currencies challenge the establishment, environmental warfare and viruses delivered via insect-machine hybrids. In the MoDs previous report, the think tank saw the emergence of a global elite, a powerful network of individuals and institutions that sits above the level of individual states and influences the global agenda Off The Grid: Alternative currencies like Bitcoin are viewed by the MoD as a a disruptive trend that will make tracking economic activity and taxes a significant challenge to the establishment because of their anonymous nature. Corporate Armies: In response to the increasingly bankrupt state, the MoD predicts that private security will gain more power. Private companies are also likely to provide many of the security functions currently provided by the state, with states increasingly contracting out their monopoly on force. The Minnesota town of Foley replaced its police department with private security in 2011. Some wealthy neighborhoods in California are hiring private security as budget cuts reduce the number of police officers on duty. Human Augmentation and Robotics: Advancing technology will eventually enable humans to enhance our abilities well beyond their natural limits.Future technologies may make it possible for people to radically alter their identities by using a range of physical and cognitive enhancements, says the MoD report. Major social disruption is the inevitable result of automated systems replacing humans. Unmanned systems are increasingly likely to replace people in the workplace, carrying out tasks with increased effectiveness and efficiency, while reducing risk to humans. This could ultimately lead to mass unemployment and social unrest. Insect-Machine Hybrids: We could also see sophisticated environmental warfare, capable of spreading plant and human diseases by insects or insect-machine hybrids. Crops and cattle could be destroyed, as well as people being incapacitated or killed. FBI agent Carmine Nigro attended a conference held at MIT on May1, 2014 thatdiscussed synthetic biology. He is quoted by the New York Times as saying, These technologies [synthetic biology] do not just pose a risk to individual buildings or cities, but if cleverly deployed, can reduce our population by significant percentages.

"The University of Texas has a moral responsibility to provide grief counselors to comfort Longhorn fans after surprise defeats that leave these people stricken. Take the game Saturday at Royal-Memorial Stadium when Texas was flogged by UCLA. Where were the mental health professionals when you really needed them? Grief commonly sets in after the Longhorns are beaten by a team the fans expect them to pound easily, in part because of pregame hype promoting the team as a national champ contender when we don't even know these guys' shirt numbers yet. So these great expectations leave the Longhorn faithful suffering from a mental condition know as PUD -- Postgame Upset Depression. You'll know PUD when you hear it in the stands. The five stages of PUD are: 1. 'What the?' 2. 'I can't believe they just did that.' 3. 'I can't believe they just did that -- again.' 4. 'They pay this clown $5 million?' 5. 'Got any of that whiskey left?' You could see PUD coming 'round the bend Saturday afternoon as the Horns were being shot not so much by the UCLA 'pistol' offense as they were by themselves, in the foot. Sitting in front of me in Section 2, directly across from those cheerful nincompoops in the blue shirts, was a guy wearing a set of earphones over a burnt-orange ball cap. With each fumble, each dropped pass, each sideways pass play going nowhere, each flirtation with football hell, this guy would splutter and curse. As if the players could actually hear him. As the game went on and mistakes were made, the spluttering and cursing became more pronounced. I thought this dude's head would eventually explode and his headset would burst into flames. The familiarity was eerie. Hadn't I seen this horror show before in an earlier incarnation? Wasn't there a mugging of similar magnitude I had witnessed on a highway somewhere, Route 66 or something? Or was I California dreamin'? Make that California nightmaring. Next time, Longhorns, do yourselves a favor and schedule Freddy Krueger instead of UCLA. Friends, neighbors and Horns fans, as your grief counselor against PUD, let me just remind you that it's not that bad. The world has not come to an end. Just the football season as we knew it previously. Life will go on. Not a quality life, necessarily, with Top 10 rankings and We're Number One-ings and road trips to, say, Glendale. Sure, a second-tier bowl kind of life. But still, life. Then again, the condition will clear up immediately if Texas beats Oklahoma. So drink three beers and see me in the morning.

"Facebook Game Predicts Mind Controlled Smart HomesNicholas West As further evidence of why Google and others see that the future of surveillance and control is likely to be accepted, attendees of the international Consumer Electronics Show (CES) played the game Whats Next?a Facebook game released by IEEE, the worlds largest technical professional organization, in order to predict the future of consumer electronics. For a chance to win a $100 Amazon gift card, a substantial 42% of those who participated in a game designed to predict future trends revealed that they are not entirely satisfied even with an automated anticipatory home where the objects in it could be programmed to cater to their every need. Rather, these players preferred the ability to control appliances and systems by thought alone. Dean Aslam, IEEE senior member and professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Michigan State University, explained: Through use of wearable Microsystems equipped with inexpensive and non-invasive brainwave and muscle sensors, we will be able to set specific patterns and thoughts to turn on ceiling fans, appliances or even lights. When you get cold, all youll need to do is blink your left eye twice or think about raising the temperature on the thermostat and youll warm right up. If you go to sleep without switching off lights and TV, they will be automatically switched off the moment the sensors find you in the state of sleep. (Source) Participants thought that the only thing better than having an app tell your coffee maker that its time to start brewing a fresh pot in the morning, is having their brains telling it to serve up a cup. 42 percent of respondents think that the future smart home appliances will be mind controlled. However, while this desire for control could be seen as a positive development, it is also unsettling in its shortsightedness. It is like saying that because I can choose the app on my hypothetical smartphone from a wide variety of choices that it is actually MY app and will behave only as directed without any of personal data being collected, my personal choices being databased, or all of that being sold to the government and third parties for purposes well beyond my control. As we know from the revelations of Edward Snowden and others, this is a naive position to have taken. But now that we know the extent to which all of our data (i.e. our thoughts) is open to the companies that lay claim to it, and the governments with which they cooperate, we want to open up our brains directly?! This merger of our brains with computer systems is another two-way street. While participants in this game feel empowered to use their mind to control things essentially reversing the traditional concept of mind control it is itself a psy-op. The mind control of the future forgoes all pretense at indirectly altering perception through media and politics, and does away with the clumsiness of mind-altering drugs and environmental toxins. The mind control of the future looks exactly like the emerging Smart Home and Smart City, which aims to become the Smart Society. It goes straight into direct programming of the digital mind via the two-way interface system being erected. This is precisely what the technocratic elite are discussing right now. This is why we are seeing such heavy investment by the twin behemoths, Google and Microsoft, inaugmented reality not so curiously one of the other elements seen as a major trend at the Consumer Electronics Show. Mind-controlled computers, tablets, phones, video games and more are already here. The direct experience with mind/perception alteration preps the individual for this type of direct manipulation in other areas of their lives. Data received and data transmitted. Every two-way action will be recorded by tech companies, then fed into government databases. Facebook itself is investing in artificial intelligence and has just appointed New York Universitys Yaan LeCun as head of these efforts to get into our heads a bit better. There is speculation that the goal of the artificial intelligence efforts at Facebook are to use its vast trove of consumer data to power intelligent search and response software that can speak with you the way the computers do on Star Trek. (Source) As LeCun explains below, much of what we would call simply Internet activity already employs artificial intelligence, from how we search the Net to what advertisements we see as a result. But predicting that behavior, to maintain the Star Trek reference, is the final frontier. The coolness, convenience, and even health and safety factors are always sold first. Here is an excellent video compilation 8 Examples of Mind Controlled Technology in Actionthat showswhat is already possible with the mind, and is being fully embraced as we race headlong toward becoming full-fledged cyborgs. Everything from mind controlled drones, robots, skateboards and your computer even remote controlled humans via the Internet are now a reality. Between the Internet of Things and revelations that reporter Michael Hastings car could theoretically have been hacked, to the desire for directly connecting ones brain to the computer matrix, the concept of a direct mind upload to the Internet/Cloud should not be seen as far off. And if all of these lesser systems are open to surveillance and hacking, whether domestically or abroad, it would stand to reason that the mind, too, will be subject to security leaks, blunders, and deliberate alteration. Now is this something you are really willing to buy into? Recently by Nicholas West: ",0
"New NDAA Expands Empire But Forbids Debate on WarBy Ron Paul But not even slower growth is enough when you have an empire to maintain worldwide, so the House majority slipped into the military spending bill an extra $89 billion for an emergency war fund. Such emergency spending is not addressed in the growth caps placed on the military under the 2011 budget control act. It is a loophole filled by Congress with Fed-printed money. Ironically, a good deal of this emergency money will go to President Obamas war on ISIS even though neither the House nor the Senate has debated let alone authorized that war! Although House leadership allowed 135 amendments to the defense bill with many on minor issues like regulations on fire hoses an effort by a small group of Representatives to introduce an amendment to debate the current US war in Iraq and Syria was rejected. While squashing debate on ongoing but unauthorized wars, the bill also pushed the administration toward new conflicts. Despite the presidents unwise decision to send hundreds of US military trainers to Ukraine, a move that threatens the current shaky ceasefire, Congress wants even more US involvement in Ukraines internal affairs. The military spending bill included $300 million to directly arm the Ukrainian government even as Ukrainian leaders threaten to again attack the breakaway regions in the east. Does Congress really think US-supplied weapons killing ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine is a good idea? The defense authorization bill also seeks to send yet more weapons into Iraq. This time the House wants to send weapons directly to the Kurds in northern Iraq without the approval of the Iraqi government. Although these weapons are supposed to be used to fight ISIS, we know from too many prior examples that they often find their way into the hands of the very people we are fighting. Also, arming an ethnic group seeking to break away from Baghdad and form a new state is an unwise infringement of the sovereignty of Iraq. It is one thing to endorse the idea of secession as a way to reduce the possibility of violence, but it is quite something else to arm one side and implicitly back its demands. While the neocons keep pushing the lie that the military budget is shrinking under the Obama Administration, the opposite is true. As the CATO Institute pointed out recently, President George W. Bushs average defense budget was $601 billion, while during the Obama administration the average has been $687 billion. This bill is just another example of this unhealthy trend. Next years military spending plan keeps the US on track toward destruction of its economy at home while provoking new resentment over US interventionism overseas. It is a recipe for disaster. Lets hope for either a presidential veto, or that on final passage Congress rejects this bad bill. Dr. Ron Pauls weekly columnfirst appearsat the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. ",0
"by Olatunbosun Awoniyi LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Barack Obama has been in Ghana for a historical two-day visit and he was given more than a hero's welcome on arriving in the west African nation late on Friday evening. It is his first visit to a sub-Saharan African nation since he took office in January this year. The U.S. Presidential jet Air Force One carrying Obama, his wife Michelle and their two daughters Malia and Sasha touched down around 21:05 hours on Friday. It was the third time that the jet Air Force One made its call to the Kotoka International Airportwhich which also witnessed visits by former President Bill Clinton in 1998 and former President George W. Bush in 2008. Moments later, a brimming President Obama accompanied by his wife and two daughters and a 50-member delegation came out of the aircraft to euphoric cheers. There were moving scenes at the airport as Ghanaian President John Evans Atta Mills and his wife Naadu approached to receive the U.S. first family. The U.S. first family, full of smiles, were introduced to the welcoming party which included politicians from all parties including Nana Akufo-Addo, the former president of the west African nation and also a candidate of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP) for the 2008 presidential elections. The Ghana News Agency reported that the festive atmosphere was enhanced by a dancing troupe from the National Dance Company whose coordinator, George Lamptey, said they were performing heraldic dances meant to welcome the august visitor and his family and make them feel at home. President Obama savored the moment by taking a few steps to the 'frontonfron' beat and encouraged his wife, who was then walking with Mills, to join in dancing to the beat. A large crowd of youth wearing Obama T-shirts defied intermittent showers as they lined parts of the street to the airport to welcome the U.S. President. There was heavy security presence and roads leading to the airport were sealed off yet this did not dampen the enthusiasm of people who came out as the motorcade made its way out of the airport. Muhammad Mumuni, Ghanaian Foreign Minister, said President Obama lived up to the government's expectation as an inspirer. He said the U.S. president's whole demeanor at the welcoming ceremony was exhilarating and he lived up to the billing as an inspirer. Speaking in the same vein, Deputy Information Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said everything went well, describing it as spotless. The itinerary for the Obama's visit begins on Saturday, with a special welcoming ceremony at the Castle, where he would hold closed-door bilateral talks with President Mills. President Obama would then be hosted to a big breakfast for about 300 guests, including former presidents Jerry John Rawlings and John Agyekum Kufuor. He would then pay a brief visit to the La General Hospital briefly in Accra, before moving to the Accra International Conference Center (AICC), where Parliament would be convened to hear his formal address. While at the AICC, President Obama would make a major policy statement that is expected to redefine America's relationship with Africa. Security personnel have been posted at vantage points throughout the city, while the police have announced the closure of a number of roads in the capital. ",1
"Lebanon's Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri on Monday condemned Israeli aggressions against Al- Aqsa Mosque and Palestinians in Jerusalem, the country's state news agency reported. Hariri said this aggression was motivated against Christian and Islamic religious sites in Jerusalem, adding that it totally went in the opposite direction to what Israeli officials speak of peace and security in the world. Clashes erupted earlier Sunday between Palestinians and the Israeli police in the eastern part of Jerusalem, as a group of Jewish radicals broke into the yard of al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine to Muslims. About 16 Palestinians and several Israeli police were injured in the clashes, according to local report. Hariri asked international community to press Israel to cease all violations, calling on Arabs and Muslims to stand in one row in face of Israel's aspirations against Palestinians and the region.

"Michelle Obama Just Received Devastating News During The Holidays Even after Americans expressed their outrage about their extravagant lifestyle, the Obamas traveled to Hawaii this year to celebrate their annual Christmas vacation.Throughout Barack Obamas two terms as president, he has pretended to identify with the struggles Americans are facing every day to make ends meet. Meanwhile, his family been spending millions of tax dollars on lavish vacations for the family. According to Judicial Watch, the Obamas spent $4,823,206.88 on their familys 2015 trip to Hawaii. In fact, the first family has made the trip for Christmas every year of his presidency, costing taxpayers a whopping $85,029,819. Their current vacation began in mid-December, and will run through January 3, 2016but Secret Service agents have rented various homes for 19 days, beginning December 16. The total for the rental this year was $245,993.12 for rooms near the Marine Corps base at Kaneohe Bay. They also spent money on rooms at the Moana Surfrider resort on Waikiki Beach and the Ala Moana Hotel, which cost a total of $40,249.28 and $671,895.99, respectively. The family also dined out at the islands most expensive restaurants, including: On Sunday, December 20, the Obamas had dinner at Morimoto, a celebrity chef-owned Asian-fusion restaurant, The Secret Service and the Air Force are being abused by unnecessary travel, Judicial Watch president, Tom Fitton, argued. Unnecessary presidential travel for fundraising and luxury vacations on the taxpayers dime would be a good target for reform for the incoming Trump administration. What do you think? Is this type of spending absolutely unacceptable? ",0

"Gates, GAVI, and WHO Administered Fake Malaria Vaccines to Asia, India and AfricaSusanne Posel, Contributor The Fogarty International Center at the US national Institutes of Health (NH) funded a study that found a shocking 20 to 42% of the malaria vaccines used in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are of substandard quality or absolutely fake. By researching studies and publications, the report explains that, according to the Southeast Asian countries, 36% of the 1,437 samples of malaria vaccines were counterfeit. Another 30% of samples could not test positive for the pharmaceutical compounds that would be in a malaria vaccine. Those drugs given to Africa were discovered to be bogus as well, with 20% of more than 2,500 samples in 6 drug classes showing that they are not real. Thirty-five percent were under drug corporation standards. These findings are a wake-up call demanding a series of interventions to better define and eliminate both criminal production and poor manufacturing of anti-malarial drugs, said Dr. Joel Breman, a senior scientist emeritus at NIH. This indicates that the pharmaceutical corporations and the non-profits are intentionally misleading these nations into taking these drugs. The economic incentives for criminals of drug falsification surpass the risks involved in their production and sale, stated the study, which was published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. GTC Bio-therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company, created this malaria vaccine more than a decade ago. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has been one of the most prominent advocates for the malaria vaccine . It is little known that several members of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation management committee, leadership teams, affiliates, and major funders are currently or were previously members of the boards or executive branches of several major drug makers , including Merck and Novartis. BMGF holdings are invested in Berkshire Hathaway, which the researchers write has significant ownership in GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis Johnson Johnson. BMGF held stock in Merck at a time when it developed partnerships with the African Comprehensive AIDS and Malaria Partnership and the Merck Company Foundation to test Merck products . . . on unsuspecting Africans. BMGF claims that: Between 2000 and 2006, several countries in Africa saw a 50 percent decrease in malaria by using a combined set of effective interventions, including insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying of homes with insecticides to control mosquitoes, and drug treatments to prevent and cure malaria. The goal of the BMGF and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) to vaccinate every human being on the planet. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that: WHO purports that, 200,000 deaths could be avoided by administering the malaria vaccine. When the majority of the vaccines administered by organizations like WHO, GAVI and BMGF are fake how is the disease being prevented? WHO, one of GAVIs partners , has teamed up with the World Bank and UN Population Fund in the 1970s under the Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation. The Task Force, acts as a global coordinating body for anti-fertility vaccine RD. GAVI is heavily funded by the BMGF for the global vaccination projects. The scientific community is working on developing strange alternatives to administering the malaria vaccine. Researchers at the Texas AM University (AM) have revealed their latest genetically modified project; GM goats that unnaturally produce the malaria vaccine in their milk. After altering the genome of goats to produce the malaria parasite, the scientists were successful in producing goats milk with genetic materials that are found in the malaria vaccine. Our ultimate, ultimate idea is to continue the research to the point to where you actually have a herd of goats that are producing vaccines, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals . . . in their milk . . . just go out and drink the milk and get vaccinated, said Mark Westhusin, scientist who participated in the experiment. It is expected that this studys findings will create a stir within the international community. How can governments trust pharmaceutical makers who produce faulty drugs or purvey fakes as authentic? No doubt the fraudulent medicines cost the same as real ones. Susanne Posel is the Chief Editor of Occupy Corporatism.

"Greta Van Susterens Career Threatened By The Obama Administration Greta Van Susteren has been a journalist for CNN and Fox News channels since the 1990s. She has a reputation for being objective, and reporting only on stories that she finds to be truthful. She has been known to vet sources and facts herself. When she reported on the 9/11 Benghazi scandal, she chronicled the Obama administrations attempts to portray the attack as a conspiracy created by an American filmmakers anti-Islamic short film. As soon as it became clear that the incident was a terrorist attack, the administration started to withhold their information. Now Susteren is claiming that the Obama administration failed to invite Fox News to the State Department conference bridge, even as they alerted other news agencies. Fox News has also been repeatedly dodged in their mission to expose the Benghazi cover up. Susteren claims that someone at the Obama administration has also made clear threats to members of her staff, telling them that they would have their careers ended if they continued to investigate the Benghazi incident.

"Do you trust the people? Being able to answer â€œyesâ€ has long been taken as a litmus test of the depth of your commitment to democracy. In a democracy, the people, like customers, may often be wrong, but must always be treated as though they are always right. Thatâ€™s why Hillary Clintonâ€™s biggest campaign gift to Donald Trump was her comment that half of his supporters belonged in a â€œbasket of deplorablesâ€. â€œNo one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their president,â€ Trump said.    No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health or engineering.   In the UK, when David Cameron recently resigned as prime minister he was not ashamed for having called a referendum he lost but â€œproud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisionsâ€. This was one Cameron line his successor Theresa May was all too happy to keep faith with. â€œWe know there is no finer accolade than to say David Cameron put his trust in the British people,â€ she said. â€œAnd trust the people we will.â€ But history suggests it is unwise to trust any politicianâ€™s claim to be trusting the people. In 1906 Winston Churchill even had the gall to assert â€œTrust the peopleâ€ was his motto in a speech defending the hereditary monarchy and House of Lords. Of course there is a sense in which democracy is about trusting the people. The mistake, however, is to assume that this trust is in the majorityâ€™s ability to reach fair and wise decisions about specific policies. That kind of trust is not just unjustified, itâ€™s borderline insane. No sensible person thinks majority opinion is a good guide to best practice in health, education, engineering, or pretty much everything else. So why would public policy be any exception? Plato and Aristotle get a bad rap these days for their rejection of democracy. But the substance of their objections were spot-on, and not just because they saw that majority opinion is not the same as wisdom. For Aristotle, democracyâ€™s fatal problem is that it divides society by pitting the majority â€“ however slender â€“ against the minority. Weâ€™re seeing this playing out in America, where the divide between Republican and Democrat has never been wider, but in elections the winner takes all. Weâ€™re also seeing this in Britain, where cosmopolitan liberal cities and conservative communitarian towns and villages view each other with incomprehension. Why then has democracy actually served us so well? Put simply because it is not democracy as conceived by its ancient Greek critics. What we call democracy is actually a system of representative government which leaves most big decisions to elected leaders. Crucially, it is also a system in which the rule of law is more important than the will of the majority at any given moment. Thatâ€™s a safeguard Aristotle didnâ€™t anticipate. Indeed, he argued that democracy was opposed to the rule of law because he thought it meant the will of the people transcended the law. To say democracy is about trusting the people is therefore simplistic in two ways. First, for democracy to work it requires the people to trust those they elect to make decisions. Demanding that politicians instead trust the people to tell them exactly what is best turns this on its head, undermining one of actual democraciesâ€™ greatest strengths. Second, our democracies are built around constitutional arrangements that make major change difficult precisely because it does not trust the people or the government to be reliable or constant. Western democracy is built around a tripartite trust: trust in the people to hold government to account and to set the general direction of policy, but also trust in politicians to make specific decisions, and in institutions to provide safeguards against rash or tyrannical actions. What we are seeing all over the western world are the last two pillars being torn down, leaving all trust resting on the people. This is rightly called populism, not in the American sense, but as understood in the rest of the world. Populism is generally defined as a mode of politics in which the will of the people is seen as clear, virtuous and homogeneous. Populist politicians simply promise to do what this will commands, ignoring or denying the fact there are different, competing interests in society, not just those of the majority. Populists do not try to square the simple desires of the electorate with the complex realities of society but pretend that what seems simple is simple and that anyone who says otherwise belongs to an obfuscating elite looking for excuses to defend its own interests. Those who oppose populists are accused of being anti-democratic because in a sense they are: they reject pure, direct democracy in which the people dictate policy, as did Plato and Aristotle. But they are completely on the side of the very successful form of democracies that we have developed, systems of government that are much better than any imagined by those great philosophers. We trust the people to play their part, but not to run the whole show.",1
"Hacked Phones Could Be Listening To Everything You SayChris Dougherty, Contributor Researchers at Columbia University have discovered a flaw in telephones that allows a hacker to turn a phones microphone into a sophisticated recording device. Using this flaw an attacker can eavesdrop on conversations remotely. 5th year PhD candidate Ang Cui and Columbia Professor Sal Stolfo discovered the flaw while working on a U.S. Defense Department grant for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). According to the researchers, they can remotely command a hacked phone to do anything they want. For example, they say they can activate a webcam on a phone or instruct the phones LED light to remain off when the phones microphone has been activated. This way the eavesdropping victim wont be alerted when their conversation is being recorded. On the dark side, these phones are sold worldwide, Stolfo said. Any government that would like to peer into the private lives of citizens could use this. This is a great opportunity to create a low-cost surveillance system that is already deployed. Its a monitoring infrastructure thats free, when you turn these into listening posts. Ang Cui, who works in the Intrusion Detection Systems Lab at Columbia University, gave a presentation on December 29th demonstrating the hack at the Chaos Communications Conference in Germany. The demonstration is appropriately titled Hacking Cisco Phones: Just Because You Are Paranoid Doesnt Mean Your Phone Isnt Listening To Everything You Say. Cui, has spent the last five years thinking about ways to defend embedded systems against exploitation. Last year he gave a detailed presentation describing a method to use a printer as a launching point to attack a corporate network. For the purpose of attacking a phone, he has created a little device called the th1ngp3wn3r (pronounced Thing Powner) kit. The researcher says this small gadget can be attached to a single Cisco IP phone and then used to turn an entire companys network into a sophisticated bugging device within seconds. Cisco acknowledged the flaw in a statement to NBC News, but wouldnt say how many of its phones were impacted by the hack. However, Cisco announced in a December vulnerability report sent to paying customers that 15 models were affected. The company appears to be working on a fix, but the researchers still consider the flaw to be very dangerous. Chris Dougherty is a grey hat hacker and online security expert.

"Police Now Using Pre-Crime Algorithm To Target and Label Innocent Citizens as CriminalsBy John Vibes Once an innocent civilian has been labeled as a threat, they are then notified that they have been marked as a potential criminal and that they are now under police surveillance. This disturbing program has quietly been in place for over three years, and in that time, government agents have visited the homes of more than 1,300 innocent people who had high numbers on the list, to inform them that they are now regarded as potential criminals. According to the New York Times, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says that officials this year are stepping up those visits, with at least 1,000 more people. We are targeting the correct individuals. We just need our judicial partners and our state legislators to hold these people accountable, Johnson insisted. However, activists and advocates of civil liberties are not convinced. Karen Sheley, the director of the Police Practices Project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, has pointed out that these innocent people are being flagged based on criteria that havent even been publicly established. Were concerned about this. Theres a database of citizens built on unknown factors, and theres no way for people to challenge being on the list. How do you get on the list in the first place? We think its dangerous to single out somebody based on secret police information, Sheley said. The current program is said to only target individuals who seem to show a high risk of being involved in a shooting. However, it is also important to point out that most laws, especially the bad ones, arent even focused on primary violations of life or property, but are instead focused on secondary actions that are seen as causal factors for these violations. It certainly should be illegal to harm people or their property, but most modern societies, in an apparent attempt to take preventative measures, have outlawed actions that could be a precursor to actual criminal activity. Some have referred to this concept as pre-crime. The idea is that people should be punished if they behave in a way that someone else is uncomfortable with, even if they have not harmed anyone. These types of laws would include: all drug laws, all gun laws, seatbelt laws, intellectual property and other victimless, non-violent crimes, where no person has been harmed, and no property has been stolen or damaged. Drugs are illegal, we are told, because their use could lead to actual crime. Guns are highly restricted because someone could get hurt. Seatbelt laws are imposed because someone could get hurt. And, intellectual property is imposed because someone may lose their investment. The arguments in favor of these laws are all overblown or flat out wrong, but the fear of future crime is always used to justify bad laws that have no basis in justice or restitution. Our entire justice system is made up of this nonsense, which persecutes people who have not hurt anyone or anything because their actions apparently indicate that they will do something harmful in the future. To begin to target individuals before they have even done anything is taking this idea of pre-crime a step further, ushering in a new age of Orwellian surveillance.

Maybe we should devise a computer algorithm to detect individuals with a Authoritarian Personality Disorder. In that event, every mental health professional will be so labeled, as they create these labels for purpose of gaining ascendancy over almost everyone around them, whom they may psychiatrically evaluate (or psychologically evaluate). These behaviorists who are so full of themselves, never slap their labels onto police! Obviously the state boards that allegedly regulate psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers would suspend or pull their licenses if they slapped labels onto police. Behaviorists and police are both enforcers for the state. But only police (usually) get to use deadly force, making police more important to the state than its ravenous behaviorists. The U.S. has been pre-crime for years. Youve summed things up nicely. Too bad 90% of the population is too stupid to see reality. how are you guilty until proven innocent ? cops word vs a persons word. The cops word is infalliable while the citizens is scrutinized in the court. Isnt Justice supposed to be blind, no preference for one or the other? The cops word should be just as scrutinized as the citizens, but it never is. There are several cases being reversed where in the police labs result was taken as 100% true that is now being revealed as inaccurate. Sit in a courtroom sometime and watch the proceedings, in every court Ive been in in the last ten years the judges attitude is if youre in their court, youre guilty. The judge isnt interested in justice, just clearing the courtroom. Get accused of any crime against a woman or child (especially an accusation of a sexual nature) you will find out very quickly. It amazes me how many people will defend the victimless laws. In the old Common Law (constitutional law) courts, when a citizen was brought before the judge, the could ask the judge who is the injured party? And if there wasnt one..they would be free to leave. If we still had common law courts, drug charges would be null and void because there is no injured party. Same with seat belt laws on down the line. I know right? They should let people drive drunk and stuff, even though its dangerous. That way, when your daughter/son, brother/sister, mother/father, wife/husband gets hit by a drunk driver and they go flying through the windshield, their brains splattered out of their skull as they lay on the pavement in a mangled heap of lifeless meat, youll be able to rest easy, knowing that, even though it wouldve saved your loved ones life, when that guy blew through the last 3 stop signs, right before he slammed into your loved ones vehicle, the cop that saw him do it didnt stop him, because his swerving and running stop signs didnt hurt anybody at the very moment that he did it. It was only a few seconds afterwards that he killed your loved one. Thats how I want to live, where thats the law! Lock up the DC criminals first, and every corrupt politician first.then when can we talk laws.as of right now I see that our nation is lawless, by a bunch of beauracrats who think they know better than us, and that is not how this country was designed nor what our founding fathers hoped for us. They had hoped we would refresh the tree of libertyif it ever was them vs us.and right now thats what we have.one nice giant kleptocraptic, smug and arrogant pompous a s s e s running the show. Mke Yeary, please drop the concept of they let or they dont let. Speeding tickets are given because the speeder committed a crime. Now, personally I would see two of these things mostly abolished , traffic cops reduced, but categorizing this pre-crime algorithm as similar/the same is inaccurate. Really? Try to turn around snd not go through a DUI checkpoint and see how fast you are chased down. These days you are guilty just because the cop says so. Well come on, thats like running into a bank with a ski-mask on, seeing a cop, then running away. If you believe that speeding is a crime, then what was the injury to a person or property? Hey its not as if Im in love with either practice; if you said lets abolish TSA and DUI checkpoints I wouldnt mind a bit. As for speeding, weve decided that exceeding safe speeds is a violation of the law; end of story. This isnt some giant oppressive / authoritarian / orwellian nation. At the root of these issues there are people who think theyre helping society. Whether theyre right or not, painting it as this intentionally oppressive police state just eliminates any possibility of productive discussion. For example, this pre-crime thing- Here its described as basically the exact system from Minority Report, whereas the reality is that all theyre doing is flagging individuals who have several priors for things like firearms and drugs, and keeping a closer eye on them than the rest of us. And guess what; it works! It turns out having a history of something is a predictor for more of that something. People freak out as if were arresting them for murders our computer says theyll commit in 2025, but that isnt the case at all. This system isnt any crazier than having a larger police force in a high-crime community than neighboring low-crime communities. Law enforcement has a job to do, and unfortunately some communities individuals predictably commit more crime than others. Telling L.E. they have to choose between doing their job less effectively vs. being looked at as oppressors by a portion of the community they serve is unfair. I think that if the citizens who have issues with the way things are done would be a less sensational with their portrayal of the situation, it would be a lot easier to identify and address whats going on. beseriousplease, in what twilight zone is speeding a crime? Thanks for responding to the entirety of my post, rather than focusing exclusively on the difference between an infraction and a criminal offense (both of which are violations of the law). Way to go; Im so glad I took the time to type it. Anyway, you have fun in your fight against the man. I think Ill get back to living among the rest of society; Ill be sure to tell them of your tragic plight. beseriousplease, you made your point clear. And you made yours; oppressive evil big government yada yada Keep fighting the good fight bud. Itll all be worth it someday gee Kell uhh let me guess uhh 0. Does a thug who posts a YouTube video of themselves brandishing firearms I guess I am surprised that in a city like Chicago there have been only Seeing as how almost everyone I know has said I hope he dies or I would if I had the chance, no, he shouldnt be visited, because its kind of that way with public figures. Facebook sees thousands of death threats about Obama a day, theyve visited like 5 in 8 years. So the Police visiting such a huge number, means they are not being super specific. Poor, black, no father on birth certificate, yup, go knock on his door, let him know we are watching him. Remember, these arent criminals. These are people never in trouble, yet 1,300 deemed criminals worth watching. Where do you get the idea that these arent criminals? The author claims their innocence with no way of having any knowledge of the matter. You expect me to believe that these people didnt have criminal records? What do you think they are basing this on, library cards? And in a city of around 3 million, 1300 people visited barely registers, certainly not a huge number. Your claims are unsubstantiated. BTW, I voted for Bernie in my states primary, a state that delivered him an early upset and win. Feelin the Bern doesnt mean checking your common sense at the door. This is about saying that we are all potentially guilty and we had better watch ourselves. It is part of political correctness. It is about getting us to self censor and always be on the defensive. It is about getting us not to trust ourselves. I was repeatedly accused of being a narcotics user. Their probable cause? I was walking a dog. Why dont police stop being indefinite and just come out into the open and admit that if youre not a member of their occupation, or a member of an occupation that supports or supervises them, they consider you to be a felon? This post is entirely misleading from what is actually being done. Chicago is only targeting known criminals and gang members who they believe will be shot soon. Just read the NY Times article that is linked. However, I do agree this is a slippery slipe that the government should NOT be doing. I have to say at least they tell these people that they are being watched rather than waiting for them to say murder someone..there are many really sick people being watched who have a psychopathic attitude and could happily kill someone. I think this is awesome. And I think you are brain dead~ Watch dogs. Its happening boiz! Why does this article work in a jab against seatbelts? would they release what data these algorithm is using? None of this will make sense by themselves would they release what data these algorithm is using? criminal records None of this will make sense by themselves. On another thing im sure they already did this before the algorithm, at least in my country i know they do, they find infromation and use some kind of shrodinger tactic, to see if they can arrest you for something, basically they will create several situations and see how would you react if they cant do anything they can change tactics, and so on indefinetly, if they persist they can also use other thing to keep pressure,like sending bots mostly woman or someone that seem to be vulnerable in case you attack them,they will repeat something you just mentioned on internet a site or wherever, but always avoiding showing its them, or giving conclusive evidence so im certain thats the source of this algorithm.Funny note if evidence of this is provided they will keep it up but more discretly to try and avoid legal action, similar things might happend in the virtual world. Isnt it amazing what a false-flag attack (9/11), a few FBI/DOJ agent provocateur concocted terror attacks, police state laws passed in the dead of night, without review, can do to a constitutional republic? Looks like its working good, especially in the hood, they would have had even more murders in chicago, pat rahm butt on the back,,,,opps I mean fanny! One wouldnt want to set off the homophobic algorithm ! EXCUSE to arrest ANYONE. Whoever is doing this minority report ironically, should be arrested for a pre-crime. Arrested before a crime is committed where is the justice in that? The words Wedge and thin end of the. spring to mind ! ",0
"Infuriated Iowa Patriots Do THIS After Veterans Memorial Is Removed The city council of Knoxville, Iowa, voted to remove the veterans memorial in their city. After doing this, the city voted to remove the council, permanently. And they were successful. As of January, there will be a new council in the city of Knoxville. No one messes with our veterans. The memorial features and soldier bowing before a cross, and because the church found this offensive, the council voted to remove it. The citizens of Iowa have since then replaced this memorial with a new one. Are you thankful for all our veterans have done for this country? ",0
"For the single home buyer, the prospects for getting on the property ladder are not encouraging. The difficulty of saving for a deposit, coupled with a lack of appetite among lenders for high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, means the number of singletons making purchases is dropping. So it is little surprise that an increasing number of friends are coming together to buy. Figures from conveyancing firm My Home Move show the number of homes bought by â€œsingleâ€ purchasers has fallen by an average of 4% over the past five years, equivalent to around 10,000 transactions a year. The benefits of pooling resources are clear: My Home Move figures show a couple of first-time buyers can afford homes worth around Â£100,000 more than their single counterparts. Given the latest government figures show the annual rate of house price growth stood at 8.3% in July â€“ bringing the average property value to Â£216,750 â€“ this additional buying power can make a big difference. Separate new figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders put the average house price for a first-time buyer house at Â£156,500. â€œWhat is clear is that annually house prices are still on the rise at levels well above wage inflation,â€ says Jeremy Duncombe of the Legal & General Mortgage Club. â€œThis growing gap ultimately makes the housing market more unaffordable, and the prospect of homeownership much harder for buyers looking to take their first step.â€ Saving for a deposit, and that aversion among banks towards high LTV mortgages, continues to be problematic. According to the latest AmTrust Moneyfacts LTV tracker, the number of available home loans for those with 5% deposits fell from 243 in July to 238 in August. â€œMore people are buying property with someone else because prices continue to rise in many parts of the country, and two salaries â€“ or more â€“ will get you much further than one,â€ says Adrian Anderson from broker Anderson Harris. But while friends who share a night out together may see collaboration as their only way to tackle spiralling prices, there are pitfalls. â€œBuying a property becomes more complicated when you involve multiple parties, notÂ only from a financial perspective, but also due to the increased potential for changes in circumstances,â€ says Brian Murphy from the Mortgage Advice Bureau. â€œCo-buyers need to go into joint ownership with their eyes wide open.â€ Here are some of the issues that such buyers need to be wary of:   Buying a property is more complicated when you involve multiple parties â€¦ keep your eyes wide open  Brian Murphy, mortgage adviser    How to structure the purchase Up to four people can be registered as legal co-owners of a property, but one of the most important considerations is how to structure the purchase. The most popular option is to be â€œtenants in commonâ€. Unlike â€œjoint tenantsâ€ you donâ€™t have to own equal shares and the property doesnâ€™t automatically go to the other owners if you die. You can also pass on your share of the property in your will. Findings from My Home Move show a rise in the number of people buying as tenants in common, particularly those with unequal shares. â€œBuyers purchasing as tenants in common are usually not married and as such have individual interest in safeguarding the investment they put into the property by listing who owns which share,â€ says Doug Crawford from My Home Move. â€œBy choosing to buy a property in this way, it means two or more purchasers can pool their collective resources to afford the best home possible.â€ If you are not putting in the same amount towards the deposit, mortgage and other expenses, itâ€™s important to get everything documented in a formal declaration of trust. This ensures everyone is clear about how much each buyer is putting in, and should include contributions towards deposits, stamp duty and legal fees, as well as how much each person is paying each month in terms of the mortgage and other expenditure. Trust and commitment When entering into a joint agreement, itâ€™s essential that all parties understand their commitment. â€œAs joint owners you are all responsible for the mortgage payments,â€ says David Gilman from the conveyancing arm of Blacks Solicitors. â€œThis means if one person canâ€™t pay their share one month, all the other owners are liable.â€ If you are buying with a friend you have to be prepared to be upfront and honest about every aspect of your finances; you should also demand that everyone else does the same. â€œAll credit scores will be taken into account,â€ says Ansar Afsar from broker We Know Mortgages. â€œYouâ€™ll need to know whether the person you are buying with has any problems with their credit history which could affect your chances of getting a mortgage.â€ When co-buying, you need to plan ahead and take legal advice on how to structure the purchase. â€œYou might be the best of friends at the beginning,â€ says Mark Harris from broker SPF Private Clients. â€œBut relationships do disintegrate, and it is far easier to manage a falling out if you have all the details of who contributed what to the property purchase in writing.â€ Searching for a mortgage While up to four people can purchase a property together, mortgage experts warn that the number of lenders who are able to consider multiple incomes is far more limited. â€œA number may allow four purchasers, but some will only consider two primary incomes for affordability purposes,â€ says Murphy. â€œOther lenders are more pragmatic, and will consider three â€“ and even four â€“ but choice is considerably reduced.â€ The get-out clause To plan for someone selling their share, you should set out details of an exit plan in the declaration of trust. â€œThis should set out key details such as when the property can be sold and how any profit should be shared. For example, if one person has paid more for renovations, they may expect more of any sale proceeds,â€ says Gilman. This document may need to be updated regularly to reflect any changes in the co-owner circumstances. Buyers should also think about what would happen if one of the group lost their job â€“ or even died. Ensuring the correct protection cover is in place can give peace of mind to all parties that the financial commitment will be covered should the worst happen. Happy together, while ready to move on When Louise Hartley and Hanna Cevik bought a flat together earlier this year, they took several precautions at the outset to try and reduce the risk of problems cropping up when either of them decided to move on. Friends for 13 years, once they found themselves ready to buy they decided to pool resources so they would not have to make too many compromises on location or space.    Hanna Cevik (left) and Louise Hartley in their shared home: â€˜By combining our savings and salaries, we were able to buy a place we liked.â€™ Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer   â€œWe were both keen to stay as central as possible in London rather than having to move further out to zones three or four,â€ says Hartley. â€œBy combining our savings and salaries we were able to buy a place that we liked.â€ Hartley, a barrister, and Cevik, a marketing manager, bought a two-bed flat in Stoke Newington for Â£465,000 in February. Their combined savings gave them a deposit of 19%, enabling them to get a competitive 2.04% rate on their two-year fixed-rate mortgage with Nationwide, helping to keep down their monthly outgoings. One of the biggest issues they needed to address before buying was how best to structure the purchase. â€œAs Hanna was putting down a greater share of the deposit â€“ as she had an inheritance â€“ we decided to buy the property as â€˜tenants in common with unequal sharesâ€™,â€ says Hartley. â€œWe got this documented in a declaration of trust. This sets out how much each of us has put towards the deposit, and the share each of us owns â€“ meaning we can each safeguard our investment. The declaration also details our liability under the mortgage and sets out who is due what percentage of the property at the point one of us exits the agreement, or the property is sold. â€œWe are loving living together at the moment, but at some point we will move in with partners. Neither of us wanted to wait to get on the property ladder, so by having all the details set down in writing we can enjoy owning a home now without having to worry about what will happen when we move on from sharing.â€",1
"Theresa May will allow ministers to express their opposition to airport expansion for a period of time after the decision is made next week, in the strongest signal yet that the government is preparing to back Heathrowâ€™s bid to build a third runway.    Related: Heathrow third runway: what does the Tory cabinet think?   The prime minister told colleagues at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that opponents of whatever decision was made would have a â€œset periodâ€ to speak frankly about their opposition. Downing Street would not confirm whether that meant ministers would have a free vote in parliament to oppose the decision.  The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the education secretary, Justine Greening, are vocal opponents of Heathrow expansion. Crucially, there are no London MPs on the cabinet subcommittee that will make the decision next week. The other two options under consideration are the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick. The committee members are: May; the chancellor, Philip Hammond; the business secretary, Greg Clark; the transport secretary, Chris Grayling; the communities secretary, Sajid Javid; the Scottish secretary, David Mundell; the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom; the chief whip, Gavin Williamson; and the party chair, Patrick McLoughlin.  Airport expansion options  During cabinet discussions, which lasted more than an hour, May told colleagues she expected any final scheme to be a â€œboost to business and competitivenessâ€ and that the decision would be taken in the national interest.    Related: Airport expansion: the experts' view   Her spokeswoman said: â€œThe prime minister wanted to approach this in a mature way, recognising that a number of ministers have long held views on this issue. And in light of that there would be a certain period of time after the committee had taken its decision where they would be able to express those views and they would not be expected to publicly support the governmentâ€™s decision.â€ May was to write to colleagues on Tuesday afternoon to set out the precise details of how the process would work, and the period of time when Tories would be able to speak their mind on the issue. Downing Street said most cabinet members spoke during the meeting, but there was consensus that a decision needed to be made as soon as possible.  The spokeswoman hinted that ministers would eventually have to accept the governmentâ€™s decision. â€œThe decision will be subject to the ministerial code, in the usual way, including the rules of collective responsibility, but with this special arrangement for a limited time. She would not confirm if the period would cover the timescale for a vote in the Commons.  â€œOnce a decision has been taken, certain ministers who have long-held views or particular constituency interests will have some flexibility to set out their personal position.â€  No 10 said it was â€œnot the expectationâ€ that ministers would be able to actively campaign against the decision that was taken. Johnson has previously vowed to lie down in front of bulldozers if they started work on the third runway.  Of the MPs on the committee, Javid is the only one who has expressed strong public support for Heathrow expansion.  Both May and Hammond have expressed tepid concerns about a third runway in the past, and the local council in Mayâ€™s Maidenhead constituency is one of those vowing legal action if expansion goes ahead.  In 2008, May said she was concerned that if Heathrow expansion goes ahead the quality of life for her constituents â€œwill deteriorate significantlyâ€. However, she has been tight-lipped on the issue since entering the cabinet in 2010.  Hammond, a former transport secretary, has also historically expressed concerns about congestion and pollution from Heathrow, saying the airport should improve rather than expand. However, he is understood to be open to the economic case for expansion. Asked why there was no London MP on the committee, Mayâ€™s spokeswoman said: â€œThis is about national infrastructure. One of the things that came through in the discussion was the importance of this for regions across the UK and making sure that, as we take a national infrastructure decision, we take it on the basis of creating a country that works for everyone.â€  Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park and former London mayoral candidate, has said he would resign and trigger a parliamentary byelection if the government approves Heathrow, with his constituency one of the worst affected by the flight path.  Goldsmith, who is popular locally, is considering running in any subsequent byelection, leaving May with a difficult decision over whether to stand a Tory candidate against him, or risk reducing her majority.  The Liberal Democrats, who also oppose Heathrow expansion, are thought to be preparing an all-out assault in an attempt to win the west London seat, which recorded one of the highest remain votes in the EU referendum, though Goldsmith voted to leave.  The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, made it clear that party policy was to support Heathrow expansion, which is overwhelmingly backed by some of the countryâ€™s largest trade unions, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency contains Heathrow, are opposed to expansion.  The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: â€œSuspending collective responsibility to avoid a tricky vote is something that Corbyn does to try and paper over the massive schisms in his party, and now, it seems, the prime minister has taken a leaf out of his book. â€œThe Conservative party made a â€˜no ifs, no butsâ€™ promise to people in west London â€“ waiving collective responsibility to save the hides of a couple of ministers will not fly. People will remember this and hold the Tories to account for their actions.â€",1
"Kentucky Police Officer Shot Down In Cold Blood, Killer Still On The Loose According to authorities, a Kentucky police officer who was wounded in a shooting is in stable condition. The suspect is still on the run. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steven Conrad said Officer Kyle Carrol was struck in the chest, and was wearing a bullet-proof vest at the time. Conrad also reports Carrol was taken to Louisville University Hospital. Carrol was patrolling the departments first division when he saw 22-year-old Jacquan Crowley, who he recognized from an arrest he made in the past. As [Carrol] drove past the man, the man turned away, which the officer believe was an effort to hide his identity from the officer, Conrad said in a news conference. That caused the officer to be concerned. Carrol reportedly made a U-turn in his vehicle and drove back toward Crowley, and proceeded to chase him. Crowley jumped a fence and then fired at Carrol, striking him in the chest. Crowley is still at large and ground and air units are searching for him. He is described as a black male, about 5-foot 11 inches, weighing about 135 pounds. He is believed to have long dreadlocks. He is said to be armed and dangerous. ",0

"In a stunning disclosure this week, congressional sources revealed that the acrimonious gridlock in the U.S. Senate traces its origins to a single November evening in 1986, when Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) engaged in sexual intercourse with Sen. Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) then-wife, Sherrill. 'The impenetrable stalemate on crucial issues is not due to a widening ideological divide between parties, as we once thought,' said Brookings Institution senior fellow Sarah Binder. 'Rather, this inability to move the legislative process forward stems almost exclusively from a jealous and resentful Mitch McConnell, who has been unable to erase the mental image of Harry Reid pleasuring his wife one wild, passionate night some 25 years ago.' 'It's been the elephant in the room for decades, and frankly, neither senator is willing to just man up and bury the hatchet,' Binder added. 'Unfortunately, our democracy continues to suffer the consequences.' Congressional insiders, who confirmed they were glad to finally have all the tension out in the open, said the rift began when the newly elected Reid met McConnell's wife at a Capitol Hill cocktail party shortly after the 1986 midterms, an encounter that eventually led the pair to a rented room at the Watergate Hotel for an intimate midnight rendezvous. Neither senator will admit that recent battles over extending the Bush-era tax cuts directly stemmed from the time Reid gave Sherrill a back rub in the congressional cafeteria. In the aftermath of that fateful night, a feud was born that would soon lead to hundreds of famously spiteful battles over everything from immigration reform measures, to the 1987 Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, to at least 14 different energy bills, sources within both parties said this week. 'Look, something was bound to happen that night between themSherrill was a shy and attractive conservative, and Harry was this dashing, bad-boy former gaming commissioner from Nevada,' said a longtime Republican aide who attended the 1986 Senate function and spoke on condition of anonymity. 'I mean, what do you expect? Frankly, Mitch should have known better than to let Sherrill out of his sight in the first place. Harry was a real wolf back then.' 'Of course, Mitch actually didn't find out until months later,' continued the aide, who claimed that McConnell overheard Sens. Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy exchanging graphic details of the liaison in the Senate men's room. 'But when he did he totally flipped. Next thing you know, he's angrily drafting some spiteful legislation to store all of the country's nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Harry's home state.' According to the Congressional Record, the senators' dispute has only escalated over the past quarter century. As the two men moved up the ranks of their parties, Reid blocked scores of Social Security reform efforts, tax-cut proposals, and veterans' health care bills that were sponsored by McConnell, while in 12 successive Congresses, McConnell introduced a defense-of-marriage amendment aimed specifically at prohibiting adultery. Sources stated that the rival senators both voted to authorize Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for the sole purpose of asserting their masculinity in front of each other, unwittingly causing the resolution to pass with a narrow 52-vote majority. Additionally, records show that McConnell filibustered campaign finance reform bills on nearly two dozen occasions, using his hours at the Senate lectern to make a number of indirect, off-color remarks about Reid's wife, Landra, and to claim confidently that he was in the best physical shape of his life. 'Much like Harry, Mitch has always strongly believed that campaign finance reform is of the utmost importance in modern American politics,' the Republican aide said. 'But he's been going against his own principles to fight these efforts tooth and nail ever since he heard a rumor that Harry was well hung.' 'People try to tell Mitch, 'Hey, get over it, man, whatever happened was years ago and you're both different people now,'' the aide continued. 'But he just can't let it go. Doesn't even seem to want to let it go, in fact.' Sources reported that the senators appeared to overcome their feud for a brief period in 1996, after McConnell had divorced his first wife and remarried. Although the two worked together to pass welfare reform that summer, their truce reportedly came to a spectacular end at the annual Senate Christmas party, when McConnell claimed he saw Reid making eyes at his new wife, Elaine, and, according to one party attendee, 'went completely ballistic,' excoriating Reid in front of the entire 104th Congress, and subsequently donating $1.5 million of his own money to establish an anti-Reid PAC. 'This whole thing could have been settled years ago if Harry had just apologized for sleeping with Sherrill and let Mitch sock him in the face so they could both get it out of their systems,' said a senator who asked not to be named, claiming that the 25-year-long congressional debacle had gotten 'pretty silly.' 'They're like little kids, honestly. Both of them. Does anybody even still remember what happened that weekend besides them?' 'I guess things could be a lot worse, though,' the senator added. 'Thank God Mitch doesn't know about Durbin, Schumer, or McCain.' ",0
"FBI Visiting Gun Shops to Investigate People talking about Big GovernmentBrandon Turbeville While government surveillance of gun purchases and gun owners is nothing new, a recent visit by an FBI Counterterrorism agent to a Columbia, South Carolina gun shop has only reinforced the knowledge that the U.S. government is growing more and more concerned by the prospect of a well-armed populace particularly one that prefers to live without constant government interference in their personal lives. While the narrative surrounding counterterrorism operations used to eviscerate civil liberties after 9/11 was initially based upon the threat of Muslim fundamentalists, that narrative has clearly shifted to a focus on gun owning, law-abiding American citizens both those who are politically active and those who are blissfully ignorant of current events. For many, this shift of focus has been quite the surprise. Thus, when the Columbia, South Carolina gun shop in question was approached by an FBI counterterrorism agent on Monday, April 14, the individuals who spoke with him were somewhat alarmed to realize that the agents concern was not fundamentalist Muslims but Americans who promote small government. According to an individual who was present during the visit (this person will remain anonymous for obvious reasons), the agent pulled up in a regular vehicle in plain clothes and took a look around the shop as if he were considering a purchase before approaching the staff and announcing that he was with the FBI Counterterrorism unit. After showing proper identification, the agent told the shop owners that he was tasked with all the gun shops in the general area and that he was charged with investigating suspicious purchases in accordance with counterterrorism operations. The suspicious purchases he mentioned, however, were completely normal transactions. This included, paying with cash, purchasing long guns, and other similarly innocuous behavior. However, what surprised the owners the most was his statement regarding what he was most interested in tracking. According to the witness, the agent stated, If you see some Middle Eastern guy come in. You dont have to be so worried about that. What were really looking for are people talking about being sovereign such as sovereign citizens or people talking about Big Government. The agent also mentioned that he had a spreadsheet of all the gun shops in the area. After this brief chat, the agent left a flyer with the shop that listed some of the more generic and normal behaviors which they were expected to view as suspicious. Some of these trigger behaviors are: In the end, while the visit to a local gun shop by an FBI Counterterrorism agent is no surprise, it should serve as a stark reminder that the U.S. government is vastly concerned about a well-armed populace. Gun rights have been gradually eroded in the United States for decades but the assault on gun rights has been ratcheted up to a new level by the Obama administration. Still, those expecting a public declaration of total gun illegality and martial law confiscation will be wringing their hands in anticipation for a very long time. Of course, while they wring their hands and anticipate the declaration of outright war against gun owners, their guns are being slowly stripped from their hands in an incremental fashion. Slight rule changes and isolated confiscations will continue to take place over time until the public has been properly acclimated to them as a fact of life, at which point the publics line in the sand will be moved slightly forward once more. Again, the line will be crossed, but only slightly. Eventually, Americans will wake up to find themselves completely disarmed and neutered in a land in which they once believed they were free. At that point, with a completely defenseless population, the thin veneer of freedom will be lifted. It is time for gun owners and gun rights activists to go on the political offensive. In 2014, it is no longer a legitimate mode of activism to be content to defend your already attenuated freedoms. It is time to make demands. It is time to throw compromise out the window.

"At a Rose Garden ceremony Tuesday, visiting Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao presented President Barack Obama with a DVD of the forthcoming action film The Expendables, which opens nationwide Aug. 13. 'I offer this gift humbly, as a gesture of goodwill from the Chinese people and as a symbol of the enduring bond of friendship and cooperation between our two nations,' Wen said through a translator before posing for photographs in which he and Obama together held the DVD case, which features a blurry, photocopied image of the film's poster and misspells Sylvester Stallone. 'We hope that you will enjoy it. And watch for the Bruce Willis and [Arnold] Schwarzenegger cameosthey're pretty cool.' Obama politely accepted the gift despite the fact that he had already purchased a copy last week during a trip to New York City. ",0
"According to a report released Wednesday by the American Film Institute, the 1982 motion picture Swamp Thing and its 1989 sequel, The Return Of Swamp Thing, are only two of literally thousands of movies in existence. The report, which describes a rich and varied cinematic history stretching from the late 19th century to the present, suggests that these two 90-minute features about a superhero who is half human and half plant constitute, in fact, only a mere fraction of all the movies ever produced, and that Swamp Thing franchise directors Wes Craven and Jim Wynorski are just two among many, many people to have made a film. Conventional wisdom tells us there are predominantly two movies out there: Swamp Thing, of course, and then its less popular but still well-known follow-up, The Return Of Swamp Thing, AFI president Bob Gazzale told reporters. What were finding, however, is that those two films are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the art of cinema has to offer. Merely a small sampling of the hundreds, if not thousands of movies that film historians say do not feature Swamp Thing. And very few of these other movies, it turns out, feature what could be construed as a plant-based mutant or green humanoid vigilante as their protagonist, Gazzale added. Using exacting methods to divide all films into the discrete categories of Swamp Thing related and not Swamp Thing related, the authors of the report concluded that the latter group is much larger than the former, with fewer than 1 percent of titles taking place in swamps or having either Swamp Thing or a similar such figure featured in them. The report went on to cite a number of movies in which actress Adrienne Barbeau does not play government agent and Swamp Thing love interest Alice Cableand many in which Barbeau does not, in fact, appear at alldemonstrating that over the years, filmmakers and films in general have been far more prolific than the public may have realized. Through a careful examination of box-office records, we have shown that during the seven-year interim between the release of Swamp Thing and The Return Of Swamp Thing, there were actually hundreds of movies written and directed in Hollywood, said Gazzale, also noting that the 1980s isnt the only decade in which films have been made. There are movies being shot at this very moment that dont, in any way, involve a respected scientist named Alec Holland being transformed by a freak lab accident into a benevolent swamp creature. AFI officials stated that a frame-by-frame analysis of a random sample of films found that the overwhelming majority do not feature a plotline concerned with an army of super-soldiers genetically enhanced by plant DNA, the catchphrase They call meSwamp Thing, or an extended opening sequence set to Creedence Clearwater Revivals Born On The Bayou. According to the report, most movies arent even based on DC Comics superheroesor on comics at all, for that matterbut exist instead within completely unrelated genres that include romantic comedies, period dramas, animated features, musicals, and even documentaries. Furthermore, despite its title and its setting in the Louisiana wetlands, 2012s Beasts Of The Southern Wild reportedly has nothing to do with Swamp Thing or The Return Of Swamp Thing. These other films are out there if you look for them, said AFI board of trustees chair Howard Stringer, showing reporters a DVD copy of Good Will Hunting. This movie, for example, can be watched from beginning to end and you wont see a single campy sequence in which a bog-dwelling monster transforms back into a man and makes love to Heather Locklear. And we have uncovered many, many more of which the same can be said. As for the quality of these other films, however Stringer added. Well, I really cant speak to that. ",0

"Known throughout the community for his verbal outbursts and his shopping cart full of trash, area street denizen 'Cosmic Stan' must have studied advanced physics at some point, sources reported Monday. Cosmic Stan asks for enough change to take a bus to the Riemannian manifolds. 'Where's my cheese? Don't take my rowboat! Got no room!' the lunatic screamed from his regular spot near the Campus Drive bus stop. 'I need space! Gimme space! Infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space!' Though his rants seem nonsensical to most passersby, some astute listeners say they contain evidence of higher learning. 'I'd always see him around that bus stop, dressed in his ragged wool clothes, duct-taped shoes, and that plastic sheeting covered over with symbols drawn in magic-marker,' Stanford Ph.D. candidate James Willard said. 'Then, a few days ago, he was out there waving his tin-foil wand at random strangers, and I heard him yell, 'I demand that you buy me an ice-cream cone! My third-favorite flavor is strange! My second-favorite is top! My favorite flavor is anti-charmed!' Suddenly, I realized the guy was talking about quarks.' Willard said he spent the next several minutes listening to Cosmic Stan's rant. 'Mixed in with the usual stuff about CIA mind-control beams, talking dogs, and monkey-people, I heard him mention beta decay, instantons, density matrix, and subspaces of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds,' Willard said. 'I'm not sure where he got it, but he definitely seems to have had extensive schooling in theoretical physics. Man, what could've happened to him?' Stanford theoretical physicist Carl Lundergaard seconded Willard's theory on the loonball. 'He's definitely had some advanced training, though I'm not surprised that it went unnoticed for so long,' Lundergaard said. 'It's hard for the layperson to differentiate schizophrenic ramblings like 'Modernity chunk where the sink goes flying on the ping-pang' from legitimate terminology like 'Unstable equilibria lie on the nodal points of a separatrix in phase space.'' Lundergaard said he first became intrigued by Cosmic Stan in December 1999, when the homeless man threw a chicken bone at him and said, 'Components of the Weyl conformal curvature tensor.' The professor said he initially suspected that Stan was repeating a phrase 'from a textbook he'd found in the garbage.' Then, several weeks later, the screaming nutcase shouted some things that indicated a strong grasp of high-level science. 'As I was buying coffee in the quad one morning, Stan came by waving those roller skates he sometimes wears on his hands,' Lundergaard said. 'I distinctly heard him say, 'I can't be in two places at once! I can't meddle in my own affairs! I can't destructively interfere with my own future plans! What do I look likethe uncollapsed wave function of an electron?' He was referring to the seemingly paradoxical aspects of wave/particle duality as illustrated by the 'two-slit' experiment in electron diffraction. Stan wasn't just mouthing phrases: The crazy homeless man knows his stuff.' Added Lundergaard: 'I almost approached him the other day to see if he had any ideas regarding the general solution for the relativistic force-free equation describing the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, but he was busy smearing a plastic doll with glue.' Cosmic Stan also appears to be versed in other academic subjects, Lundergaard said. 'He seems to have a working understanding of several of the higher maths, including Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, category theory, and algebraic topology,' Lundergaard said. 'He also seems to be quite interested in the subjects of religion, sexuality, fast-food restaurants, Ferdinand de Saussure, malevolent evil, '70s TV shows, and shadowy authority figures.' Lundergaard said he has no knowledge of Cosmic Stan's past, but theorizes that his nickname derives from the physics term 'cosmological constant.' 'You have to wonder how this happened to him,' Lundergaard said. 'Was he calculating the transition amplitudes between the unperturbed eigenstates due to the presence of the perturbation in order to determine transition probabilities in time-dependent quantum phenomena, and the next day, strapping a TV antenna to his head?' Perched atop a bicycle rack on Marquette Street, Cosmic Stan was asked for comment. 'Who you? You've been balderdashed! Doodads! Wood glue, dammit!' Cosmic Stan said, glancing around wildly and cradling a partially disassembled transistor radio. 'Fock space! Spin polarization! The Clausius-Clapeyron equation obtains! The incident field is representable by a plane wave vector potential! You gotta believe me!' ",0

"Scores of people were arrested Tuesday in a major operation against organised crime and drug trafficking in Bosnia's Serb entity Republika Srpska, police said. More than 540 police took part in operation 'Network 2010', aimed at dismantling gangs dealing in drugs as well as stolen cars and contraband cigarettes, Bosnian Serb police chief Uros Pena told the Srna news agency. Police made 102 arrests, with 10 set to appear in court, the official said. They also recovered automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition, cannabism, heroin and cocaine in raids across the entity. Republika Srpska is one of two entities that make up Bosnia-Hercegovina, formed after the end of the 1992-1995 war sparked by the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. ",1

"Though Tiger Woods told reporters he was 'pleased' to win the PGA Championship last Sunday, the 13-time major winner said he was also deeply annoyed that Sam Alexis, his two-month-old daughter, was 'not even paying attention' when Woods sank his tournament-winning putt on the 18th hole. 'I was happy that she was there and everything, but she behaved as if she didn't even understand the gravity of the situation,' said Woods, adding that his baby girl 'didn't even clap' when he made a clutch birdie putt on the 15th hole and that he had even caught her giggling when he bogeyed the 14th. 'Whether she likes it or not, golf is what puts a roof over her head, so I expect her to be more respectful in the future.' Woods later stated, however, that he couldn't find fault with his daughter's apathetic feelings towards the upcoming FedEx Cup events, saying that he himself thinks of it as a forced and unoriginal attempt to inject excitement into the final part of the golf season.

"Will the Legal Justification For Assassinations Without Due Process Be Released?Joe Wright There has been virtually unanimous agreement over the lack of transparency of the kill program as outlined in the so-called targeted killing playbook, by John Brennan. Sen. Mike Lee urged full release of the Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum on targeted killings to the oversight committee, while AG Holder appeared to flip-flop by adding a tentative no to his letter to Sen. Rand Paul stating that killing Americans domestically without due process was constitutional. Despite promises to release all information, there have instead been 20 instances that members of Congress have asked for the memo without success. The Hill is now reporting that the continued pressure has resulted in a statement from Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy that the members will finally be granted access to these memos. But will the public ever learn the full extent of what they contain? So far, the only information comes via a 16-page white paper leaked to NBC News. Questions immediately were raised about the meaning of threat imminence which Sen. Lee cited from page 7 of the 16-page leaked version. The white paper states that a lethal strike against a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist group can occur if a three-part test is met: a high-ranking American intelligence official must have determined that the person poses an imminent threat, the persons capture is not feasible and a strike on that person is conducted according to the laws of war governing use of force. That definition seems to establish the extrajudicial component of the kill program. Holder certainly couldnt answer the question satisfactorily when pointedly asked about it at the last meeting, stating repeatedly, Im not sure. Holder did say that he, like Brennan, thinks there could be a place for judicial review, but remains worried that it would interfere with operations. Even though he stammered through the questioning of Cruz, The Hill notes that he had specified three criteria when first presenting the case for drone strikes against U.S. citizens in a speech at Northwestern University: there was a limited open window for attacking the person, a grave possible harm that not attacking the target could have on U.S. civilians, and a strong likelihood that targeting the person would head off a future attack against the United States. The hearing to address these issues, titledDrone Wars: The Constitutional and Counterterrorism Implications of Targeted Killing certainly states the obvious and should give full opportunity for the current administration to defend itself against the Constitution. Lets see if this Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights subcommittee becomesjust another dog and pony show like The 9/11 Commission, or if there are any representatives remaining to take a stand and truly protect the American people who are next in line for the atrocities thus far committed overseas. What do you think will be the outcome of this investigation? Will the American people ever learn when it is acceptable to be killed without due process within the borders of their own nation?

"WASHINGTON â€” In the nine weeks since the Federal Communications Commission said it would try, for a third time, to write new rules to secure an open Internet, at least 69 companies, interest groups and trade associations â€” over one a day â€” have met with or otherwise lobbied commission officials on what the rules should specify.That effort does not count the more than 10,000 comments that individuals have submitted to the F.C.C.Now the flood of lobbying efforts is likely to increase after the disclosure Wednesday evening that the F.C.C. would soon release preliminary rules allowing for the creation of special, faster lanes for online content to flow to consumers â€” for content providers willing to pay for it.The F.C.C. had previously warned against those types of deals, saying they could unfairly discriminate against companies that could not or were not willing to pay. But after a federal appeals court struck down, for a second time, the commissionâ€™s earlier regulations, the F.C.C. is trying again.Reaction was swift to the proposed new rules, as consumer groups accused the commission of betraying its promise to maintain net neutrality, or equal treatment for both providers to and users of the Internet. That prompted an immediate rebuttal from the F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, who said late Wednesday that speculation that the commission was â€œgutting the open Internet ruleâ€ was â€œflat out wrong.â€The jockeying continued on Thursday. Verizon, which brought the court challenge that prompted the last set of open Internet rules to be struck down in January, issued a statement warning against â€œunnecessary and harmfulâ€ new rules. Consumer advocates reiterated their opposition.Mr. Wheeler stepped up his defense of the commissionâ€™s plans. â€œThe proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted,â€ he wrote in a post on the F.C.C.'s blog.The sparring will be closely watched by every company that depends, even peripherally, on the Internet â€” which is to say, just about every company. Businesses that use Internet connections to provide consumer services â€” obvious ones like Google and Netflix but also home alarm system providers, medical equipment companies and even makers of washers and dryers â€” will thrive or fail based on how much it costs them to maintain easy online contact with households and businesses.As such, the lobbying ahead of the release of the proposed new rules on May 15 is certain to be intense. As recently as Tuesday, officials from the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which represents cable and broadband companies and is led by Michael K. Powell, a former F.C.C. chairman, met with commission staff members to discuss the pending proposals.For Internet service providers, video distributors, movie studios and even medical companies, lobbying efforts will center on what it means for a broadband provider to favor some content over another in a â€œcommercially reasonableâ€ way â€” the standard that the F.C.C. says will determine whether a practice is acceptable.The F.C.C. says its proposal will show that it is trying to accomplish most, if not all, of the same goals that it pursued in its 2010 Open Internet Order, which the appeals court struck down.â€œThe court of appeals made it clear that the F.C.C. could stop harmful conduct if it were found to not be â€˜commercially reasonable,' â€ Mr. Wheeler wrote in his post. The commission â€œwill propose rules that establish a high bar for what is â€˜commercially reasonable,â€™ â€ he said.In addition, he wrote, the commission â€œbelieves it has the authority under Supreme Court precedent to identify behavior that is flatly illegal.â€For years, many advocates of a free Internet have said that information should never have to pay a toll to ride on the web. But as traffic and competition has increased, much of it from big video providers like Netflix, the Internet has been becoming more congested and regulators have struggled to catch up with new digital realities.If the F.C.C. fails in this attempt to devise rules that withstand judicial scrutiny, it might have no choice but to try to reclassify broadband for stricter utilitylike regulation, which would likely result in another trip to court.With no more than vague guidance, many interested companies were reluctant to comment. But Verizon said in a statement that it was â€œpublicly committed to ensuring that customers can access the Internet content they want, when they want and how they want.â€ However, it added, â€œGiven the tremendous innovation and investment taking place in broadband Internet markets, the F.C.C. should be very cautious about adopting proscriptive rules that could be unnecessary and harmful.â€That position was also put forth by two Republican lawmakers, Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee.In a joint statement, they said, in part: â€œWe have said repeatedly that the Obama administrationâ€™s net neutrality rules are a solution in search of a problem. The marketplace has thrived and will continue to serve customers and invest billions annually to meet Americansâ€™ broadband needs without these rules. Chairman Wheelerâ€™s approach to regulation seeks to freeze current market practices, which will cast a chill on technological breakthroughs and cause American consumers to lose out.â€But plenty of groups supporting a strict interpretation of net neutrality criticized the F.C.C.'s plans.Michael J. Copps, a former F.C.C. commissioner who is working with the nonprofit advocacy group Common Cause to keep net-neutrality safeguards in place, said big telecommunications and entertainment companies had spent millions to lobby for rules that would allow them to tilt the scales in their favor.The F.C.C.'s plan â€œis a lot closer to what they wanted than what we wanted,â€ Mr. Copps said in a phone interview. â€œIt reflects a lot more input from them.â€ Based on what the F.C.C. has revealed so far, he said, the commission appears to be going beyond what the appeals court laid out.â€œThe courts did not tell Chairman Wheeler to take the road that he is reportedly taking,â€ Mr. Copps said.",1
"Japans Prime Minister Calls for Robot RevolutionBy Melissa Dykes A new greeter at the entrance of the Mitsukoshi department store in central Tokyo has caused a stir. The worker, dressed in a kimono and cheerfully welcoming shoppers in honorific Japanese, is a robot made by Toshiba and shows how lifelike these machinescan be. This latest example of Japans skill comes just as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is calling for a robot revolution. Advances in robotic computing power, the ability to recognise voices and images, and machine learning could help the country overcome the handicap of a fast-ageing populace and a decliningworkforce. Really? Are robots going to take care of the elderly and pay all their bills when they and their children have no jobs? This is a country that has a national holiday called Respect For the Aged Day each September. Now they cant wait to terminate their elders income? Maybe theyll also adopt Britains medical policy of asking older patients age 75 and up if they are ready to die while theyre at it? How about signing this Do Not Resuscitate order too and would you mind slipping on this toe tag to save us the trouble? The Age continued: At the opening of Japans Robot Revolution Initiative Council on May15, Abe urged companies to spread the use of robotics from large-scale factories to every corner of our economy and society. Backed by 200 companies and universities, the five-year, government-led push aims to deepen the use of intelligent machines in manufacturing, supply chains, construction, and health care, while expanding robotics sales from 600billion yen ($6.4 billion) annually to 2.4trillion yen by 2020. Japans total fertility rate currently sits well below replacement rate at 1.41 births per woman. The image above is more than just a robot door greeter at a department store in a country with a dwindling population of young people to take care of its elderly. Its a death knell for the income of the nations already dwindling human population, sung by robots. The [Japanese] government wants machines to provide logistical support, perform surgery, and work in disaster recovery in the quake-prone nation. Other priorities are commercial drones and nurse robots. Panasonic has developed a robot that transforms from a bed to a wheelchair, while a startup, Cyberdyne, has created devices that help the infirm move around. Says Yoshiko Yurugi, a robotics expert at the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation: We are entering an era when we will definitely have to rely on the help of robots. Cyberdyne? Like theself-aware artificialintelligence in the Terminator movies that attempts to exterminate humanity? They couldnt think of another name?? Really?? Wellapparently it wont take literal robotic death machines like in the Terminator movies to wipe humanity out all the robots will have to do is take everyones jobs.

"â€œI saw a big pipe spewing out raw sewage into the East River, and I thought: â€˜Iâ€™m the pipe, the sewage is my songs and the river is the world.â€™â€  That is how Fred â€œFMâ€ Cornog decided on the name East River Pipe â€“ perhaps the most tragically mundane band name in history, but one that feels entirely appropriate for his timid yet defiant one-man symphonies. Long before the idea of home recording gained mainstream acceptance, Cornog quietly dug a niche for himself as an outsider pop craftsman, a songwriter of rare melodic gifts sidelined by a cruel and shallow world. â€œBring on the loser,â€ he sang proudly on 1995â€™s Poor Fricky. Cornogâ€™s stoicism in the face of societyâ€™s indifference helped him create music of sometimes overwhelming poignancy. Growing up in suburban New Jersey in the 70s, Cornog was into top 40 radio and Tom Verlaine when all around him dug heavy rock. Various attempts to form or join bands ended in disaster, so he began to record alone. He took various menial jobs â€“ carpet warehouse, lightbulb factory â€“ before succumbing to drug and alcohol addiction. He became homeless, sleeping on benches at Hoboken train station. But eventually one of his tapes found his way to a woman called Barbara Powers, who sought him out, gave him shelter, started a label to release his music and eventually became his wife. Cornog was saved, though heâ€™d seen enough in his years on the streets to provide him with a lifetimeâ€™s worth of material about the travails of the little guy. He also deduced that the music business was a complacent sham. East River Pipe would remain outside it all, untainted by careerism or collaboration.  East River Pipeâ€™s music first found its way to the UK via the cult indie label Sarah Records. The association made perfect sense, since Cornogâ€™s music â€“ fragile and bereft but also shimmering and resourceful â€“ shared many similarities with that of Sarahâ€™s flagship band, the Field Mice. The two mini-albums East River Pipe released on Sarah â€“ Goodbye California (1993) and Even the Sun Was Afraid (1995) â€“ remain the finest distillation of his essence. The likes of Dogman and Sleeping With Tallboy revisit his time sleeping rough without seeking pity or redemption, while the brilliant Make a Deal With the City reveals his coping mantra: â€œSometimes just blow up / Sometimes just deflate / Sometimes just hang on / Sometimes pull the weight.â€    While some of his 90s alt-rock peers used lo-fi recording techniques as an ideological attack on mainstream rock, Cornog â€“ who had no choice but to record at home â€“ tried to explore the possibilities of the eight-track recorder, layering his vocals and coating everything in generous reverb to the point where even his basic, slo-mo drum-machine beats attained a kind of humble majesty. Listen to songs such as Powerful Man and Flyinâ€™ Lyinâ€™ Dyinâ€™ and you can hear why New York Times once called him â€œthe Brian Wilson of home recordingâ€ â€“ not just for his meticulous layering of sounds but in the way he yearns for a simpler, less vicious world. Cornogâ€™s songs arenâ€™t designed for mass consumption, but whenever they do connect with an audience they tend to connect deeply. Lambchopâ€™s Kurt Wagner became a superfan, covering no less than three East River Pipe songs on their 1997 album Thriller, before nabbing a couple more for the follow-up, What Another Man Spills. The songs lose nothing in translation from Queens apartment to Nashville porch, proving that Cornog could have branched out if heâ€™d wanted to. He didnâ€™t, although he did enjoy a fleeting moment of critical acclaim. His 1999 album The Gasoline Age â€“ a concept album about the loneliness of the US highway that came on like a pocket-sized Bruce Springsteen â€“ was anointed album of the year by the New York Times and the Independent. His subsequent albums are well worth seeking out for songs such as Backroom Deals and Shut Up and Row, in which Cornogâ€™s frustrations take on a more overtly political dimension. He has refined his trademark sound over the years but in essence nothing much has changed. There are no guest musicians, remixes or anything to distract from the purity and consistency of the Cornog vision. Hopefully, heâ€™ll continue to pump his sewage into the East River for many years to come.",1

This tardy-to-needless sequel to 2003â€™s unusually scabrous studio comedy plays the same dirty tricks with only negligible variations: rather than shopping malls, incorrigible wash-up Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) and his diminutive sidekick (Tony Cox) are reteamed to rip off a Chicago homeless charity. If confronting Willie with mother-from-hell Kathy Bates was one smart creative decision, nothing else â€“ not the jokes about Coxâ€™s size, not charity supervisor Christina Hendricksâ€™ susceptibility to Willieâ€™s dubious charms, nor the ensuing alleyway pumping â€“ catches us by surprise this time. Likable Mean Girls pro Mark Waters wrings occasional snickers from a patchy script, but the whole feels tamely conventional: misanthropy passed through the usual Hollywood motions.

"Imagine being at Paul Murray Live on the night Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. Youâ€™ve just been on the panel with your mates Lathos (Mark Latham), Deano (Rowan Dean) and Cammo (Ross Cameron), crowing about how you saw Trumpâ€™s victory coming, and how the media elite â€“ that is, those bits of the media that donâ€™t perpetually employ you to rail against the â€œmedia eliteâ€ â€“ didnâ€™t, because of their faith in silly things like polling. Whereas you were right, very right. Alt-right, even. With the same bold instinct for ignoring the data that led your candidate to reject climate change as a Chinese hoax, youâ€™d been predicting for months that Trump would win. You havenâ€™t felt this vindicated since that brief period in between Tony Abbott winning office and his poll numbers heading dramatically south.   Related: 'We've been oppressed': Australian mates of Trump share his finest hour   Earlier in the day you held a party for â€œTrumpâ€™s Aussie matesâ€, and it turned out to be a victory party. In states like Michigan, Iowa and Pennsylvania, the working class on whose behalf youâ€™re perpetually willing to speak fought back against the party that claimed to represent them. And that made it a day for vindication, for revenge against all the inner-city latte-sippers in places like Surry Hills, with the obvious exception ofÂ The Australian, where the only permissible coffee is instant â€“ and not International Roast, which sounds like something made by the UN. Instead of Hillary Clinton and her elite mates, the world will now be run by a billionaire who lives in a golden skyscraper. Instead of a corrupt president who used to charge rich people millions for delivering speeches, the US will be governed by a man who charged poor people thousands for bogus university courses â€“ and Rudy Giuliani, who has also charged rich peopleÂ millions for delivering speeches. Instead of the first black president being replaced by the first woman, weâ€™ve got the 44th white guy. And you called it. This means that political correctness is dead. The days of white guys having to put up with at least one woman or person of colour â€“ or even, sometimes, a woman of colour â€“ on a panel alongside them are finished. The braying of those who criticised Lathosâ€™ attacks on that Australian of the Year who lost her son will be silenced at last. Because Donald Trump has proved that saying outrageous things doesnâ€™t make you a pariah, it makes you a winner. It means that youâ€™re in touch with the people, or at least those of them who live in electorally useful states. Surely Lathos wouldnâ€™t have lost that election if it had been held in 2016? Maybe he should run again? The media elite has tried to silence you, no question. Why, Rowan Dean hasnâ€™t been invited ontoÂ Q&AÂ since September 2016! What you need is a show of your own, to give people like you, but specifically you, a permanent voice. Instead of being subjected to the tyranny of the elite bookers ofÂ Q&A,Â PM Live,Â The Bolt Report,Â Jones & CoÂ andÂ The Drum, some of which donâ€™t even invite you on every single week, you need a show of your own. The elite wonâ€™t be welcome on that show, thatâ€™s for sure. Itâ€™ll just be you and your ordinary mates, with ordinary backgrounds like the federal government and theÂ Financial ReviewÂ andÂ Spectator. Battlers. The only question is what to call the show. Well, those sneering leftards at the ABC haveÂ Insiders, where prominent media commentators mouth off about Australian politics. Your show will be the opposite, because on it, other prominent media commentators will mouth off about Australian politics. So,Â Outsiders. In fact, you and your mates are so systematically excluded from the media elite in this country that it takes you precisely one email to get your show up. â€œIt could be close to a record for the fastest conception of a TV network news program,â€ Cammo will tell the Oz (link has a non-elitist paywall). â€œIt required two conversations and one email and it took less than 24 hours.â€ Thatâ€™s how outsiders get it done. Lathos will go on to confirm his own exclusion from the establishment by boasting that heâ€™ll be able to contact Trumpâ€™s White House directly, without needing to go through Greg Norman like the Australian PM did.Â  And your show will be exactly as balanced as Trumpâ€™s cabinet thus far. â€œThereâ€™s no gender balance. Weâ€™re all white. We donâ€™t believe in things like gender balance,â€ Lathos will say. And he certainly knows a bit about being unbalanced.

"Is It Wrong To Be Anti-Government?Brandon Smith The mainstream media now places far more emphasis on the political affiliations and philosophies of madmen than it does on their personal disorders and psychosis. The medias goal, or mission, if you will, is to associate every dark deed whether real or engineered to the political enemies of the establishment, and to make the actions of each individual the collective shame of an entire group of people. I could sift through a long list of terror attacks and mass shootings in which the establishment media jumped to the conclusion that the perpetrators were inspired by the beliefs of Constitutional conservatives, conspiracy theorists, patriots, etc. It is clear to anyone paying attention that the system is going out of its way to demonize those who question the officially sanctioned story, or the officially sanctioned world view. The circus surrounding the latest shooting of multiple TSA agents at Los Angeles International Airport is a perfect example. Paul Ciancia, the primary suspect in the shooting, was immediately tied to the Liberty Movement by media outlets and the Southern Poverty Law Center, by notes (which we still have yet to see proof of) that law enforcement claims to have found on his person. The notes allegedly use terms such as New World Order and fiat money, commonly covered by those of us in the alternative media. The assertion is, of course, that Paul Ciancia is just the beginning, and that most if not all of us involved in the exposure of the globalist agenda are powder kegs just waiting to go off. The label often used by the MSM to profile people like Ciancia and marginalize the organizational efforts of liberty based culture is anti-government. The establishment desires to acclimate Americans to the idea that being anti-government is wrong; that it is a despicable philosophy embracing social deviance, aimless violence, isolation and zealotry. Looking beyond the mainstream position, my question is, is it really such a bad thing to be anti-government today? The terms anti-government and conspiracy theorist are almost always used in the same paragraph when mainstream media pundits espouse their propaganda. They are nothing more than ad hominem labels designed to play on the presumptions of the general population, manipulating them into dismissing any and all alternative viewpoints before they are ever heard or explained. The establishment and the media are ill-equipped to debate us on fair terms, and understand that they will lose control if Americans are allowed to hear what we have to say in a balanced forum. Therefore, their only fallback is to bury the public in lies so thick they wont want to listen to us at all. The Liberty Movement now has the upper hand in the war for information. The exposure of multiple conspiracies in the past several years alone has given immense weight to our stance, and reaffirmed warnings we gave long ago. When we spoke out against the invasion of Iraq, commissioned by George W. Bush on the dubious claim that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were an immediate threat to the security of our nation, we were called liberals and traitors. Today, Bush and Cheney have both openly admitted that no WMDs were ever present in the region. When we attempted to educate the masses on the widespread surveillance of innocent people by the NSA, some of them laughed. Today, it is common knowledge that all electronic communications are monitored by the Federal government. When we refused to accept the official story behind the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Fast and Furious program, we were called kooks. Today, it is common knowledge that the Obama Administration purposely allowed U.S. arms to fall into the hands of Mexican cartels. When we roared over the obvious hand the White House played in the Benghazi attack, we were labeled racists and right wing extremists. Today, it is common knowledge that the White House ordered military response units to stand down and allow the attack to take place. I could go on and on Events that were called conspiracy theory by the mainstream yesterday are now historical fact today. Have we ever received an apology for this slander? No, of course not, and we dont expect one will ever surface. We have already gained something far more important legitimacy. And what about Paul Ciancias apparent belief in the dangers of the New World Order and fiat money? Are these conspiracy theories, or conspiracy realism? The Liberty Movement didnt coin the phrase New World Order, these political and corporate luminaries did: Is economic collapse really just a fairytale perpetrated by anti-government extremists bent on fear mongering and dividing society? Perhaps we should ask Alan Greenspan, who now openly admits that he and the private Federal Reserve knew full well they had helped engineer the housing bubble which eventually imploded during the derivatives collapse of 2008. Or, why not ask the the White House, which just last month proclaimed that economic chaos would result if Republicans did not agree to raise the debt ceiling. Does this make Barack Obama and the Democratic elite conspiracy theorists as well? It is undeniable that government conspiracies and corporate conspiracies exist, and have caused unquantifiable pain to the American people and the people of the world. Knowing this, is it not natural that many citizens would adopt anti-government views in response? Is it wrong to distrust a criminal individual or a criminal enterprise? Why would it be wrong to distrust a criminal government? The Purpose Behind The Anti-Government Label When the establishment mainstream applies the anti-government label, they are hoping to achieve several levels propaganda. Here are just a few: False Association: By placing the alleged anti-government views of violent people in the spotlight, the establishment is asserting that it is the political philosophy, not the individual, that is the problem. They are also asserting that other people who hold similar beliefs are guilty by association. That is to say, the actions of one man now become the trespasses of all those who share his ideology. This tactic is only applied by the media to those on the conservative or constitutional end of the spectrum, as it was with Paul Ciancia. For example, when it was discovered that Arizona mass shooter Jared Loughner was actually a leftist, the MSM did not attempt to tie his actions to liberals in general. Why? Because the left is not a threat to the elitist oligarchy within our government. Constitutional conservatives, on the other hand, are. False Generalization: The term anti-government is so broad that, like the term terrorist, it can be applied to almost anyone for any reason. The establishment does not want you to distinguish between those who are anti-government for the wrong reasons, and those who are anti-government for the right reasons. Anyone who questions the status quo becomes the enemy regardless of their motives or logic. By demonizing the idea of being anti-government, the establishment manipulates the public into assuming that all government by extension is good, or at least necessary, when the facts actually suggest that most government is neither good or necessary. False Assertion: The negative connotations surrounding the anti-government stance also suggest that anyone who defends themselves or their principles against government tyranny, whether rationally justified or not, is an evil person. Just look at how Washington D.C. has treated Edward Snowden. Numerous political elites have suggested trying the whistle-blower for treason, or assassinating him outright without due process, even though Snowdens only crime was to expose the criminal mass surveillance of the American people by the government itself. Rather than apologizing for their corruption, the government would rather destroy anyone who exposes the truth. False Shame: Does government criminality call for behavior like that allegedly taken by Paul Ciancia? His particular action was not morally honorable or even effective. It helped the establishments position instead of hurting it, and was apparently driven more by personal psychological turmoil rather than political affiliation. But, would it be wrong for morally sound and rational Americans facing imminent despotism within government to physically fight back? Would it be wrong to enter into combat with a totalitarian system? The Founding Fathers did, but only after they had exhausted all other avenues, and only after they had broken away from dependence on the system they had sought to fight. Being anti-government does not mean one is a violent and dangerous person. It does mean, though, that there will come a point at which we will not allow government to further erode our freedoms. We will not and should not feel shame in making that stand. I do not agree with every element of the anti-government ethos that exists in our era, but I do see the vast majority of reasons behind it as legitimate. If the establishment really desired to quell the quickly growing anti-government methodology, then they would stop committing Constitutional atrocities and stop giving the public so many causes to hate them. If they continue with their vicious bid to erase civil liberties, dominate the citizenry through fear and intimidation and steal and murder in our name, then our response will inevitably be anti-government, and we will inevitably move to end the system as we know it.

"Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter took command of the 2.5-million-dollar UBS Hong Kong Open after the third round on Saturday, shooting a six-under-par 64 to lead by two shots from Graeme McDowell. Poulter's bogey-free round was the joint second-best score of the day as the flamboyant Englishman built on a one-stroke lead going into the weekend. US Open champion McDowell sits on his own in second place on 17-under after his round of 63, while England's Simon Dyson is in third, one shot further back. Poulter said he was relishing the prospect of Sunday's contest with Northern Ireland's McDowell. 'It's going to be good fun. We had lunch earlier in the week actually -- Tuesday, it was -- and we were having a little bit of banter in the pub and I told Graeme that I was going to win this week,' he said. McDowell looks set to significantly close the gap on his rival Martin Kaymer at the top of the European Order of Merit, with the German skipping Hong Kong ahead of the season-ending 7.5-million-dollar Dubai World Championship. After embarking on a birdie blitz around the Fanling course on Friday in a career-best 60, Poulter found chances a little harder to come by as he finished 19-under overall. He picked up shots on the second and 13th, as well as an eagle three on the par five third. But it was his birdie-birdie finish, with putts of 12 feet on the penultimate hole and 18 feet at the last, that put the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play winner two clear of McDowell. Poulter still has plenty of work to do to secure a 10th European Tour title on Sunday. McDowell had an eagle on the 367-yard par four 10th before collecting three successive birdies from the 13th. 'I fully expect to have to shoot 65 to have a chance to win tomorrow and I'm not going to do anything differently. I'll just keep playing the way I'm playing,' McDowell said. McDowell said he was playing better in Hong Kong than he had in months. 'I'm not under any extra pressure. Next week is such a big purse that if Martin Kaymer goes and wins next week it's all over anyway so I may as well go out and relax and play my golf tomorrow. 'I'm really feeling in control of my emotions. I'm not thinking about the Race to Dubai when I'm out there -- I'm thinking about the UBS Hong Kong Open.' Dyson, from England, produced a tidy round of 65 to sit third on 16 under, one ahead of Ulsterman Rory McIlroy and Anthony Kang of the USA. 'I shot the same score as yesterday but definitely a nicer way to finish the round,' McIlroy said. 'I'm a couple behind but feel as if I'm playing well and made some key up-and- downs on the back nine to keep myself in there.' Noh Seung-yul regained his putting touch after a third round three-under-par 67 and believes he can put the Asian Tour Order of Merit fight out of reach for closest rival Marcus Fraser. The Korean teen star, the leader of the Asian money list, shot five birdies over his closing seven holes to move to the middle of the leaderboard. 'It was a good finish yesterday and today. I birdied the first hole and then on the second hole, I made a five-foot par putt, which was a good start,' said Noh, who has a three-day total of five-under-par 205. Fraser finished the day tied 11th after carding a three-under 67 for a 12-under- par total. He shot a 64 on Friday to make a significant move up the leaderboard to keep his Merit hopes alive. ",1
"China is preparing to build three times as many nuclear power plants in the coming decade as the rest of the world combined, a breakneck pace with the potential to help slow global warming. China's civilian nuclear power industry -- with 11 reactors operating and construction starting on as many as another 10 each year -- is not known to have had a serious accident in 15 years of large-scale electricity production. And with China already the largest emitter of gases blamed for global warming, the expansion of nuclear power would at least slow the increase in emissions. Yet inside and outside the country, the speed of the construction program has raised safety concerns. China has asked for international help in training a force of nuclear inspectors. The last country to carry out such a rapid nuclear expansion was the United States in the 1970s, in a binge of reactor construction that ended with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. And China is placing many of its nuclear plants near large cities, potentially exposing tens of millions of people to radiation in the event of an accident. In addition, China must maintain nuclear safeguards in a national business culture where quality and safety sometimes take a back seat to cost-cutting, profits and outright corruption -- as shown by scandals in the food, pharmaceutical and toy industries and by the shoddy construction of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan province earthquake last year. 'At the current stage, if we are not fully aware of the sector's over-rapid expansions, it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants,' Li Ganjie, the director of China's National Nuclear Safety Administration, said in a speech this year. A top-level corruption scandal is already unfolding in the nuclear industry. In August, the Chinese government dismissed and detained the powerful president of the China National Nuclear Corp., Kang Rixin, in a $260 million corruption case involving allegations of bid-rigging in nuclear power plant construction, according to official media reports. No charges have been reported against Kang, who is being held incommunicado for interrogation. While none of Kang's decisions publicly documented would have created hazardous conditions at nuclear plants, the case is a worrisome sign that nuclear executives in China may not always put safety first in their decision-making. In contrast with its performance in industries like toys, China has a strong safety record in industries like aviation, which receive top-level government attention. The challenge for the government and for nuclear companies as they increase construction is to keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners. ",1
"It is becoming harder to turn a blind eye to the suffering in Yemen, though plenty of people in London and Washington are trying. In the last month alone, the bombing of a funeral, killing at least 140 people, the strike on a prison, taking 58 more lives, and photographs of skeletal teenagers have all testified to the devastating impact of an overlooked war. Since it broke out in March last year at least 10,000 have died, including 4,000 civilians. The impoverished country struggled even in peacetime. Now more than 3 million have been displaced; 14 million are going hungry. Four out of five Yemenis need aid. The Houthi rebels bear a good deal of blame for the devastation. They drove out the internationally recognised president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, allying with his predecessor, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been ousted in the Arab spring. But heavy bombing by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition has claimed an inordinate number of civilian lives â€“ including in the funeral and prison attacks â€“ and it is done with arms and military support from the US, the UK and others. Some argue that this western involvement is moderating Saudi behaviour. That argument, never convincing, looks thinner by the day. The former business secretary Vince Cable has now told the Guardian that he was misled when he signed export licences for British-made missiles on the proviso that the UK would have oversight of potential targets, since the Ministry of Defence has said it has no military personnel in the â€œtargeting chainâ€, and has denied ever offering Mr Cable such assurances. The inadequacy of any influence that Britain and the US have obtained in exchange for arms should be evident from the civilian death toll, repeated attacks on schools and hospitals, and growing evidence of the use of cluster bombs. Meanwhile, the conflict makes it easier for perpetrators of rights abuses elsewhere to brush aside criticism as sheer hypocrisy, and creates new opportunities for jihadists â€“ surely not in British or American interests. Some in Saudi Arabia, too, question the wisdom of an expensive war as it drains coffers that are harder to fill thanks to lower oil prices. Riyadh fears Iranâ€™s growing power, and has no desire to see another country fall under its rivalâ€™s sway; US officials say they have intercepted weapons shipments to the rebels, which Iran denies, though some experts say that Tehranâ€™s support for the Houthis appears to be more rhetorical than substantial. In any case, Riyadh has now invested so much political credibility in this conflict that it cannot easily walk away. The international community needs to help it find a way out â€“ and up the pressure to make sure it takes it. The UN peace deal presented to the various parties last month (but not disclosed publicly) offers some faint hope: it signals at least that there is an attempt to move beyond simple demands for a restoration of the government and look for a realistic solution. But resolution is a long way off, and Mr Hadiâ€™s rejection of the deal is unsurprising, since it appears that it would have sidelined him. In the meantime, the absurdities mount. Half of the $115bn worth (Â£92bn) of weapons sales agreed under the Obama administration are still in the pipeline. Meanwhile, its ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has urged Riyadh to halt indiscriminate strikes. The UK, which has licensed Â£3.3bn worth of sales since the Yemen conflict began, boasts of increasing aid by Â£37m. The pledge would be laughable if it was not so shameful. By August, the damage caused by war already stood at an estimated $14bn. The aid will go only a short way to repairing that â€“ and no sum can restore lost limbs or revive the dead. Such contradictions are fuelling calls by both US and UK politicians for a halt to arms sales and support. Beside the overwhelming moral case is the legal one: arms cannot be sold where there is a clear risk that they will be used in breach of international humanitarian law. There can now be little doubt that that is the case. The US has warned that security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank cheque and announced a â€œpolicy reviewâ€ â€“ likely to mean kicking the issue into the long grass. In Britain, the parliamentary arms control committee split, with some MPs calling for an immediate suspension but others arguing that the UK should await the judicial review won by the Campaign Against Arms Trade. That is due to be heard early next year. But each day of delay means more stunted children, more maimings, more homes destroyed, more lives torn apart, more deaths by starvation or bombardment. There is no time to lose. Britain and the US should halt arms sales now.",1
"WASHINGTON â€”  In a major decision on the role of religion in government, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Constitution allows town boards to start their sessions with sectarian prayers. The ruling, by a 5-to-4 vote, divided the courtâ€™s more conservative members from its liberal ones, and their combative opinions reflected very different views of the role of faith in public life, in contemporary society and in the founding of the Republic.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, said that a town in upstate New York had not violated the Constitution by starting its public meetings with a prayer from a â€œchaplain of the monthâ€ who was almost always Christian and who sometimes used distinctly sectarian language. The prayers were ceremonial, Justice Kennedy wrote, and served to signal the solemnity of the occasion.The ruling cleared the way for sectarian prayers before meetings of local governments around the nation with only the lightest judicial supervision.The decision built on one from 1983 that allowed prayers at the start of legislative sessions. The two sides on Monday disagreed about whether town board meetings, which include not only lawmakers and spectators but also citizens seeking to do business with the government, are meaningfully different from legislative sessions.Justice Kennedy said the prayers in both settings were â€œmeant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the nationâ€™s heritage.â€Justice Elena Kagan said in dissent that the townâ€™s practices could not be reconciled â€œwith the First Amendmentâ€™s promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government.â€She said the important difference between the 1983 case and the new one was that â€œtown meetings involve participation by ordinary citizens.â€She did not propose banning prayer, Justice Kagan said, but only requiring officials to take steps to ensure â€œthat opening prayers are inclusive of different faiths, rather than always identified with a single religion.â€Town officials in Greece, N.Y., near Rochester, said members of all faiths, and atheists, were welcome to give the opening prayer. In practice, however, almost all of the chaplains were Christian. Some prayers were explicitly sectarian, with references, for instance, to â€œthe saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.â€Two town residents sued, saying the prayers ran afoul of the First Amendmentâ€™s prohibition of government establishment of religion. They said the prayers offended them and, in Justice Kennedyâ€™s words, â€œmade them feel excluded and disrespected.â€But Justice Kennedy said the relevant constitutional question was not whether they were offended. â€œAdults often encounter speech they find disagreeable,â€ he wrote. â€œLegislative bodies do not engage in impermissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in which they need not participate.â€Justice Kennedy said traditions starting with the first Congress supported the constitutionality of ceremonial prayers at the start of legislative sessions. Both Houses of Congress, he said, have appointed and paid for official chaplains almost without interruption ever since. Legislative prayer, he said, is â€œa practice that was accepted by the framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.â€In a long footnote, Justice Kagan disputed that assertion, saying some of the most prominent members of the founding generation â€” George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison â€” took pains to keep sectarian language away from public life. â€œThe demand for neutrality among religions is not a product of 21st century â€˜political correctness,â€™Â â€ she wrote, â€œbut of the 18th century view.â€But Justice Kennedy said legislative prayers may have sectarian content and need not â€œbe addressed only to a generic God.â€ He added that it would be perilous for courts to decide when prayers crossed a constitutional line and became impermissibly sectarian.â€œTo hold that invocations must be nonsectarian,â€ he wrote, â€œwould force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, a rule that would involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the townâ€™s current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.â€Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined all of Justice Kennedyâ€™s opinion, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas most of it.Justice Kennedy did suggest that some prayers may be unacceptable if offered consistently, including ones that â€œdenigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation or preach conversion.â€ But without proof of â€œa pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize or betray an impermissible government purpose,â€ he wrote, â€œa challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.â€Town officials had tried, he said, to recruit members of various faiths to offer prayers.In dissent, Justice Kagan said they had not tried hard enough. â€œSo month in and month out for over a decade,â€ she wrote, â€œprayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits.â€In 1983, in Marsh v. Chambers, the Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska Legislatureâ€™s practice of opening its legislative sessions with an invocation from a paid Presbyterian minister, saying that such ceremonies were â€œdeeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.â€Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, said the case from Greece, N.Y., was different. The prayers at the town board meetings were often explicitly sectarian, they said, and residents were forced to listen to them in order to participate in government.â€œNo one can fairly read the prayers from Greeceâ€™s town meetings as anything other than explicitly Christian â€” constantly and exclusively so,â€ Justice Kagan wrote in her dissent in the case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, No. 12-696.Moreover, she said, the clergy â€œput some residents to the unenviable choice of either pretending to pray like the majority or declining to join its communal activity, at the very moment of petitioning their elected leaders.â€In a concurrence with the majority opinion, Justice Alito called the dissentâ€™s qualms â€œreally quite niggling.â€That comment, Justice Kagan responded, â€œsays all there is to say about the difference between our respective views.â€",1
"Western leaders meeting in London have urged key political and economic figures in Libya to come together amid signs that infighting over the conduct of the central bank and the control of oil supplies is driving the country to the brink of economic chaos and authoritarian rule. The meeting was called at the insistence of the US and followed a public row between Libyaâ€™s UN-backed prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, and its central bank governor, Saddek al-Kabir. Both Sarraj and Kabir were at the meeting, also attended by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.   Related: Libya crisis talks held in London as economy 'nears collapse'   Accused of mismanaging the economy and failing to protect the value of the dinar by Sarraj, Kabir had hit back by saying the government failed to produce any coherent economic plan or make use of resources provided by the central bank. The Italian foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, described the meeting as a â€œsignificant step forward in addressing perhaps the most important problem that Libya has today, namely a financial crisis that stems from the lack of liquidity â€“ the root cause for tensionsâ€. A compromise would help the Tripoli government improve oil and gas infrastructure and build stability, he said. In a statement the US state department said the ministers â€œcalled upon all Libyan economic institutions to work togetherâ€.  Johnson said: â€œIt is now imperative that the [Libyan government] makes swift progress on delivering public services: electricity in homes and cash in banks, for the benefit of all Libyans.â€ In the only recent glimmer of hope for Libya, oil production under the control of the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) has been surging since the Libyan National Army wrested control of the eastern oil terminals.    Fayez al-Sarraj at the meeting in London. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images   Production rose to 670,000 barrels a day this week, up from the 363,000 in the last week of September. But funds are urgently required to improve pipelines, terminals and oilfields damaged in various stages of the civil wars that have gripped the country since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The NOC chairman, Mustafa Sanallah, wants to reopen two fields in the south-west of the country whose closure has caused the country a loss of $27bn. His aim is to push production up to 900,000 barrels a day â€“ providing badly needed revenue for a country teetering on economic disaster, lacking any nationwide government and unable to stem the flow of refugees across the Mediterranean. Four-fifths of Libyan government revenues come from oil, but the distribution of any oil revenues is hampered by the existence of two rival central banks, one in the east and the other in the west. The country has no finance minister. Sarrajâ€™s Government of National Accord has been unable to form a recognisable government after failing to win popular support in the east of the country. For months, the last Libyan elected parliament, sitting in rump form in Tobruk, has failed to endorse Sarrajâ€™s cabinet appointments. Even in Tripoli in recent weeks, the government has seemed to be on the brink of losing control to a coup.  Currency shortages have also led to long queues at banks despite the delivery of notes from a British money printing company. The World Bank reported in October that the Libyan economy was on the brink of disaster. It said: â€œWith oil production just a fifth of potential, revenues have plummeted, pushing fiscal and current account deficits to record highs. With the dinar rapidly losing value, inflation has accelerated, further eroding real incomes.â€",1
"U.S. Defense Contractor to Blanket Earth With New Surveillance TechnologyBy Nicholas West According to Lockheed, they are making final preparations for a next-generation global imaging satellite called DigitalGlobe WorldView-4. If all remains according to plan, the new satellite will be launched into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base as early as September 15, 2016. While Google rightly takes heat for its government connections, publicly traded DigitalGlobes relationship to the U.S. government is about as fascistic as could ever be constructed. As The Denver Post reported in 2014, DigitalGlobe successfully petitioned the U.S. government to remove previous restrictions on the sale of higher-resolution images to non-government buyers thus opening up new domestic and international commercial applications. The previous generation of this satellite, WorldView-3 at the time, contained an alarming level of accuracy: WorldView-3 can produce 31-centimeter-resolution images, and several of its already-orbiting satellites already can capture 41-centimeter images. But DigitalGlobe was prohibited, until Wednesday, from selling anything sharper than 50-centimeter resolution to non-U.S. government customers. The 31-centimeter resolution images allow viewers to discern, for example, the windshield of a car and the direction the car is facing. DigitalGlobe executives told The Denver Post last month that its new sensors allow them to see minerals, identify tree and plant species and gather soil composition. When analyzed, this information can decipher whats beneath the surface insight that can then be sold to industries including mining or oil and gas exploration. [emphasis added] The Post goes on to reveal the key reason why such a lenient permission might have been granted: the largest customer of DigitalGlobe is the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, also known as GEOINT. The incredible scope and applications of GEOINT is laid out on the .mil websites About page keep in mind the revolving door between military and private companies across the planet, and the choice to offer selective image sales becomes even more troubling. From the discovery of atrocities in Kosovo, to support for the cities hosting the Olympics, through the response to Hurricane Katrina, and our work in Haiti and Japan, NGA has provided critical GEOINT support when our nation needed it most. In the White House report reviewing the response to Hurricane Katrina, NGA was specifically commended for our timely response during the crisis. GEOINT offered an early version of the same total picture for responders that the administration later recommended for the entire nation as its plan to address major disasters in the years ahead. . In fact, NGA helped track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin and shared insights with the special operations team that successfully stormed his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 1, 2011. [emphasis added] It is of paramount concern that the functions of Lockheeds upgraded globe-spanning satellite will no doubt be shrouded by the impenetrable cover of military National Security, while the collected images can be sold to private buyers around the world. Scouring the planet from 400 miles overhead, the new parameters for the WorldView-4 system are described as follows from a recent Lockheed press release: The high resolution and high accuracy images taken by WorldView-4 will support DigitalGlobes worldwide customer base, said Carl Marchetto, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space. DigitalGlobes smart imagery serves hundreds of thousands of end-users charged with the safety and security of nations, and enables the maps and geospatial applications relied on by billions of consumers. Only the DigitalGlobe constellation, with the addition of WorldView-4, offers the highest quality, and most comprehensive global coverage of our changing planet through 2030, so our customers can be confident they will have the information to make critical decisions, said Dr. Walter Scott, Founder and Chief Technology Officer, DigitalGlobe. WorldView-4 will help us continue to transform the way we see the world, and advance our mission of keeping our planet and its people safe and secure. Once launched, WorldView-4 will double DigitalGlobes coverage of the worlds highest resolution imagery and increase the rate at which it grows its 15-year library of time-lapse high-resolution imagery. WorldView-4 will orbit Earth every 90 minutes, traveling 17,000 miles per hour and capturing more 680,000 square kilometers of the Earths surface daily (19.5 terabytes) the equivalent of the land area of Texas. (Source) [emphasis added] The statement that DigitalGlobes smart imagery serves hundreds of thousands of end-users charged with the safety and security of nations should sound an alarm to anyone who finds themselves concerned with a trends toward world governance. The reference to a changing planet through 2030 also would suggest a connection to the United Nations 2030 sustainable development agenda. WorldView-4, then, would appear to be a centralized repository of sensitive images and earth analysis controlled by a single company with direct ties to government. The possibilities for exploitation, political maneuvering and conspiratorial intrigue cant be difficult to imagine. As supposedly democratic countries ramp-up secret surveillance of their own citizens under the pretext of security based upon acts of terror that continue to be proven as State-sponsored, and climate change is set to be used as political and economic warfare, a globe-spanning corporate/government all-seeing eye funded privately and publicly offers a dangerous mechanism of total control.

"For Leicester City it was a night to savour even if they made hard work of it in the end. The club who won 2-1 at Scunthorpe eight years ago to the day to go top of League One, in front of 7,967 people at Glanford Park, will be among the select band of teams taking their seats in Nyon next month for the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League. It is easy to see why Claudio Ranieri keeps talking about fairytales. Leicester, the 5,000-1 title winners, who had not won a game in Europe since 1961 before the start of this season, have joined Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain in the knockout stage of Europeâ€™s premier club competition. Not only that but they have done it with a game to spare and as group winners, meaning Ranieriâ€™s team will be among the first seeds in Switzerland.   Related: Champions League roundup: Borussia Dortmund and Legia Warsaw set record   Even allowing for the fact that they were not handed the toughest assignment in Group G, Leicesterâ€™s achievement should not be overlooked. They have won four of their five Champions League matches and played with freedom and belief in a competition in which their interest will now be extended until March next year. The big question, perhaps, is what Leicester can do between now and then domestically after such a disappointing run of results in the Premier League. Yet this was not an evening to dwell on where things have gone wrong for them this season. There were celebrations at the final whistle, Ranieriâ€™s name reverberated around the stadium and the supporters also sang about â€œgoing on a European tourâ€. For 45 minutes it had looked like Leicester would qualify in style as they raced into a two-goal lead against a Brugge side who arrived and departed without a Champions League point on the board. Shinji Okazaki, with a beautifully taken goal in the fifth minute, gave Leicester an early lead and when Riyad Mahrez converted from the spot to register his fourth Champions League goal, it seemed like an exercise in damage limitation for Brugge.   Related: Claudio Ranieri delighted but desperate to focus on Premier League problems   Instead a wonderful solo goal from JosÃ© Izquierdo early in the second half changed the complexion of the match and there were some anxious moments for Leicester to endure in the closing stages. They held on, however, and could easily have scored again in the final few minutes, when the substitute Demarai Gray went close on a couple of occasions.   Related: Pochettino gamble falls flat in Monaco and Spurs crash out after five games   In a sense it felt like a restorative victory for Leicester on the back of their chastening defeat at Watford on Saturday. Yet the second half was far from convincing and Ranieri accepted that the way his team reacted to Izquierdoâ€™s goal highlighted the â€œlack of confidenceâ€ among his players at the moment. It was such a contrast to the opening 45 minutes, when Leicester were in total control as Brugge gave them far too much time and space to move the ball around. The visitors also looked like an accident waiting to happen at the back. â€œThe first half was a disaster,â€ Michel Preudâ€™homme, the Brugge manager, said, pulling no punches. Leicesterâ€™s opening goal came from a counterattack reminiscent of last season as they broke from one end of the pitch to the other in the blink of an eye. Marc Albrighton started the move by pinching possession deep inside his own half and picking out Jamie Vardy on the halfway line. With a neat touch, Vardy offloaded the ball to Christian Fuchs, who made up ground on the left before delivering a low, inviting cross that Okazaki expertly lifted high into the net with a first-time shot on the run. Brugge were all over the place. Mahrez turned Laurens de Bock inside out before drilling a low shot that Ludovic Butelle, the Brugge goalkeeper, pushed around his near post, and then Okazaki almost scored again when Fuchs set him up for a second time after Vardy had robbed the dithering Brandon Mechele. The second goal felt inevitable and it arrived in the 28th minute after Dion Cools, the Brugge right-back, clumsily brought down Albrighton as the winger darted into the area. Ruddy Buquet, the French referee, will never have an easier decision to make and Mahrez confidently dispatched his penalty kick, sending Butelle the wrong way. Brugge looked resigned to defeat, yet early in the second half came a bolt from the blue. Exchanging passes with Jelle Vossen after Fuchs had been caught in possession, Izquierdo scampered clear on the right, cut inside and thumped a rising shot from just inside the area that flashed inside Zielerâ€™s near post. It was the first goal that Leicester had conceded in 412 minutes of Champions League football and suddenly Brugge started to play with the belief that suggested they fancied their chances of scoring another. Anthony Limbombe, a second-half substitute, found himself in a similar position to Izquierdo but was nothing like as deadly. For Leicester, Jeffrey Schlupp and Gray both squandered opportunities at the other end to put the game beyond Brugge in a frantic finale, yet in the end those missed chances did not matter on what will go down as another historic night for the Midlands club.",1

"SHOCKING: 8 States Just Banned Atheists From Doing This Thing According to the U.S. Constitution, religious tests cant be required to hold public office. However, according to recent reports from Fox News, it appears that eight of our states are doing just do that. According to Fox, provisions barring atheists from holding public office are actually written into the constitutions of those states. However, the law is virtually unenforceable. That stems from a 1961 Supreme Court decision, which involved a Maryland man who was appointed as notary public. The justices ruled that the man did not have to declare his belief in God to be eligible for the office, as going so would violate his rights. The case made enforcement of the provisions illegal, but did not require removing them altogether. The rule remains in Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Obviously, some atheists are not happy about the laws remaining on the books. According to Dave Muscato, a spokesman for American Atheists, it is only fair and right that the Supreme Court declared the provisions illegal. He went on to call them blatantly discriminatory, immoral, and un-American. What do you think? Are the laws justified? ",0
"â€œToxicâ€ is a potent word. It sounds like something dangerous dripping in a lab. By definition, to be toxic is to have the ability to cause harm, and itâ€™s a term we often ascribe to human behaviour. We all have the ability to cause harm to each other; tangible and abstract, visible and invisible. But what makes a person toxic? A flesh-and-bones poison? We could say that itâ€™s acts of abuse, bigotry, bitching, spitefulness, selfishness, lying, gaslighting or an absence of empathy: all types of behaviour that cause pain. More generally, a personâ€™s apparent poisoning of â€œeverything they touchâ€ â€“ their romantic relationships, friendships, work relationships â€“ in a way they donâ€™t seem to understand.   Related: The Archers domestic abuse is classic â€˜gaslightingâ€™ â€“ very real, little understood | Jay Watts   To consider someone to be toxic seems to imply there is some fundamental glitch in their emotional matrix, that in place of their heart is a lump of polonium. A common kneejerk reaction might be to think that, if someone feels the need to ask if theyâ€™re toxic, they probably are. But letâ€™s not be so quick to judge. Weâ€™re consumed with the concept of human toxicity in todayâ€™s society: toxic relationships, toxic friendships, toxic masculinity, toxic bosses, toxic colleagues, toxic energy. But despite the proliferation of the word and the number of â€œtestsâ€ on the internet to tell you whether you are â€“ or someone you know is â€“ toxic, itâ€™s worth considering the following. First: any â€œAnswer these 10 questions to find out if youâ€™re a toxic person!â€ quiz may claim to enlighten you â€“ but â€œtoxicâ€ is neither a personality type or a diagnosis. And second: in order to understand and evaluate our own behaviour, itâ€™s important to consider how we interpret the behaviour of others. So, if I am wondering whether I am a toxic person, I need to ask myself: â€œWhat does toxicity look like to me?â€ Making any interpretation of behaviour means, by virtue of being a human being with a wildly complex brain, automatically bringing ourselves into the equation. Our belief systems about what are and arenâ€™t good ways to act are indiscernible, shape-shifting helixes informed by genetics and life experience. If a friend has done something that has upset me, that upset is as much about me as it is them. That isnâ€™t to say my emotion is not real or valid, or that the person in question should take my hurt any less seriously. Rather, it is acknowledging that at the very heart of any matters psychological, we are dealing with perceptions. Two sets of values colliding.    â€˜Childhood experiences of distress and fear as a result of neglect or abuse are very common in people with personality disorders.â€™ Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP   Often, when hurt, we can assume people perceive things the way we do. Looking at the US election is a good example. People of a certain mindset â€“ considering inhumane any person or system that favours the undermining of minorities to upgrade life for the majority â€“ hope that others feel the same. Sometimes that hope gives way to assumption. So many assumed Donald Trumpâ€™s flagrant spectrum of discrimination would be a barrier to him ever becoming president. Is mocking disabled people at campaign rallies a toxic thing to do? Do not the allegations made by several women that Trump sexually assaulted them give the man even the vaguest whiff of toxicity? What about being racist? The answers will depend on who you ask and what their own belief system tells them is right and just. More than 59 million voters in the US didnâ€™t seem to think so. In our day-to-day lives, how we attach meaning to othersâ€™ or our own behaviour can be explained by attribution theory. Broadly speaking, this aspect of social psychology suggests that the attributions we make about peopleâ€™s behaviour can be classified as either internal or external. If I make an internal attribution, I believe that a personâ€™s behaviour is down to their traits, intentions or abilities, without considering context. For example, if a driver cuts me up on my bike, I might think: â€œUgh, selfish dick. What a terrible driver.â€ I might not consider why they cut me up. Iâ€™ve automatically gone to â€œselfish dickâ€ zone, very quickly attributing someoneâ€™s behaviour in one space, at one time, to who they are fundamentally as a person. An external attribution means I understand a personâ€™s behaviour to be a product of context, so, this driver may have had to swerve due to my own position on the road, or may not have had enough room to manoeuvre because of the position of other cars.    â€˜If a driver cuts me up on my bike, I might automatically go to â€˜selfish dickâ€™ zone.â€™ Photograph: Wanda McCrae/Alamy   In psychoanalysis it is believed that, in order to deal with conflict, the ego has a range of defence mechanisms. These operate on an unconscious level and help us feel better about ourselves. One of those mechanisms is projection, which is when a person attributes their own thoughts and feelings on to others. For instance, you might have an anger management problem, but your superego tells you that kind of anger isnâ€™t a good trait to have, and you â€œsolveâ€ the problem by believing that everyone around you is angry. As my dad used to say to me: â€œIf you think everyone is an arsehole, itâ€™s you thatâ€™s the arsehole.â€ By asking Google whether I am toxic, I am likely to be trying to make sense of a pattern of difficult interactions. Maybe I feel that everyone is angry or upset with me all the time. Maybe I have noticed that I argue with people a lot or canâ€™t hold down a relationship with a partner. Maybe Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m toxic. However, there is no rulebook for emotional behaviour. We can only judge our actions based on the impact they have on others. Our mental health affects how we think, perceive, feel or relate to others, and there are conditions that can have a significant impact on our ability to do that. Personality disorders are often characterised by a personâ€™s odd, destructive behaviour that can be distressing and upsetting to those around them. Itâ€™s thought that one in 20 people in the UK has a personality disorder and there are several types, usually grouped into clusters.    â€˜A common kneejerk reaction might be to think that, if someone feels the need to ask if theyâ€™re toxic, they probably are. But letâ€™s not be so quick to judge.â€™ Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Rex   Someone with borderline personality disorder may be emotionally unstable and have very intense, short-lived relationships. A person with antisocial personality disorder may bully others they see as vulnerable and show no remorse for their actions. Unfortunately, these conditions are not well understood, and are often misdiagnosed. In such cases, a personâ€™s behaviour is liable to be misconstrued. Furthermore, childhood experiences of distress and fear as a result of neglect or abuse are very common in people with personality disorders. Most models of psychology will agree that negative behaviours are coming from a place of pain. There is much to consider when we try to pick apart â€œbadâ€ human behaviour â€“ including our own. When looking inwards, perhaps a better question to ask would be: â€œAm I aware?â€ Am I aware of how I make people feel? Am I aware of how I act? With awareness comes options. If my human connections are problematic, it would be an act of both self-kindness and selflessness to talk to someone to try to identify the patterns. In doing so, I may be able to work out ways that I can mend connections, or indeed start to make them.",1
"After Orlando and San Bernardino and Paris, there is new urgency to understand the signs that can precede acts of terrorism. And with the Islamic Stateâ€™s prolific use of social media, terrorism experts and government agencies continually search for clues in posts and Twitter messages that appear to promote the militantsâ€™ cause.A physicist may not seem like an obvious person to study such activity. But for months, Neil Johnson, a physicist at the University of Miami, led a team that created a mathematical model to sift order from the chaotic pro-terrorism online universe.In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Dr. Johnson and Miami colleagues searched for pro-Islamic State posts each day from mid-2014 until August 2015, mining mentions of beheadings and blood baths in multiple languages on Vkontakte, a Russia-based social media service that is the largest European equivalent to Facebook. Ultimately, they devised an equation that tries to explain the activity of Islamic State sympathizers online and might, they say, eventually help predict attacks that are about to happen.Experts who study terrorism and online communication said that the new research was informative, and that they appreciated that the authors would make their data available to other researchers. But they cautioned that the actions of terrorist groups are extremely difficult to anticipate and said more information was needed, especially to substantiate any predictive potential of the teamâ€™s equation.â€œThis is an interesting approach, this is a potentially valuable approach, and more research should be done on the approach,â€ said J. M. Berger, a fellow in George Washington Universityâ€™s Program on Extremism and the co-author of â€œISIS: The State of Terror.â€ â€œBut to jump ahead to the utility of it, I think, takes more work.â€Dr. Johnson, who also heads the Complexity Initiative, an interdisciplinary research program at the University of Miami, said the studyâ€™s goal was to start â€œa proper quantitative science of online extremism to replace the black-box narrative that is currently used.â€Instead of focusing only on large social media groups or trying to track millions of individual users, the researchers suggest focusing on small, nimble groups because they reflect groundswells of new activity and, if followed, can potentially point to where that activity is going. While such tracking in itself might not prevent individual acts, like the massacres in Orlando or San Bernardino, it can help identify when conditions are ripe for such acts to happen, the study said.The tracking of terrorists on social media should take a cue from nature, Dr. Johnson said, where â€œthe way transitions happen is like a flock of birds, a school of fish.â€â€œThereâ€™s no one fish saying, â€˜Hey, I want everyone to be about five inches away from someone else, and weâ€™re going to have this shape,â€™ â€ he said.The researchers â€” including experts in international covert networks who spoke Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish â€” analyzed activity on Vkontakte because Facebook shuts down pro-Islamic State discussions very quickly, Dr. Johnson said, and because Vkontakteâ€™s 350 million users are diverse, including many Chechen members who have been targets of Islamic State propaganda. For comparison, the researchers tracked groups promoting civil unrest in Latin America, including strikes and protests, and found both similarities and differences to online activity supporting the Islamic State.The study focused on small groups of Islamic State supporters that formed online and found about 200 such groups, with more than 100,000 members combined. The groupsâ€™ postings included pledges of allegiance to the extremists, fund-raising appeals and survival tips, like how to protect oneself during drone attacks. The pull of small groups is strong. So-called lone wolf sympathizers do not remain alone long, the study said: They usually join a small group within weeks.Quashing these groups, the study found, can prevent their members from fusing with larger pro-Islamic State groups, which can quickly distribute inciting videos or statements to much broader audiences. But when small groups are blocked by Vkontakte, about a quarter of them reinvent themselves â€” changing their names, reincarnating, or briefly going dark before re-emerging, the researchers found.The researchers also said there might be a spike in the formation of small online groups just before an attack takes place. This is based on the one major unexpected attack by the Islamic State that occurred during the months the researchers studied: the attack on Kobani, a Syrian town on the Turkish border, which came under siege in September 2014.Just before the Kobani incursion, the rate of creation of pro-Islamic State online groups accelerated, Dr. Johnson said. After all the data on small groups was plugged into the teamâ€™s equation, the Kobani attack was the only one the formula would have predicted, showing that the equation matched real-world occurrences during the period studied, he said.Faiza Patel, a director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York Universityâ€™s Brennan Center for Justice, said the study showed that â€œthere are ways to look at narrow groups rather than the entire population of internet users.â€But because the Kobani attack was the only example cited, she said, â€œFrankly, at this point, I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re predicting anything.â€â€œThere may be five other independent reasons for the spike in this pro-ISIS propaganda,â€ she noted, â€œand I donâ€™t know they have taken into account the other possible explanations.â€Mr. Berger said Kobani, aside from being the sole example cited, was a military-style operation, not a terrorist attack, so the formula, should it hold up, might only apply to large-scale sieges.â€œWith military action, if their strategy is to use social media to intimidate, then it makes senseâ€ that there would be a spike in online groupsâ€™ forming just before, he said. â€œBut with a terrorist attack, weâ€™re often talking about one, two, sometimes a dozen people who are operating out of conditions of secrecy.â€Attacks like the one in Orlando are still rare, Ms. Patel said, with â€œso many different variables that itâ€™s very, very difficult to come up with any predictive formula.â€Both Mr. Berger and Ms. Patel noted a tricky question raised by the research: When is it best to try to suppress small groups so they do not mushroom into bigger groups, and when should they be left to percolate? Letting them exist for a while might be a way to gather intelligence, Ms. Patel said.Dr. Johnson said that was one of many questions for further research. â€œIf I break the groups up too quickly,â€ he said, â€œI have the risk that Iâ€™m liberating out these individuals,â€ scattering them like a virus to infect other groups.Other questions involve how fast information travels among small groups, and the role of women â€” who, the researchers reported in a previous study, accounted for about 40 percent of group members and were likely to communicate about twice as many pieces of information through the social network as men were.Mr. Berger praised the researchersâ€™ transparency.â€œThere are a lot of companies that claim to be able to do what this study is claiming, and a lot of those companies seem to me to be selling snake oil,â€ he said. If the predictive theory holds up, he added, it would be â€œthe silver bullet everybody in the government and everybody in the private sector has been chasing for years.â€",1
"Board games have become a big deal in recent years, with growing numbers of players looking for a more sociable alternative to consoles, computers and smartphones. That rising demand has been met by talented designers turning out innovative new games at an incredible rate, but, with thousands of titles hitting the shelves each year, choosing the right ones can be tricky.   Related: The rise and rise of tabletop gaming   Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re starting a new monthly guide to help you find the best games for you, your friends and family, and to steer clear of disappointing duds. This month weâ€™re frolicking in the Antarctic, battling against dark magic and building global travel empires in the age of steam. Ice Cool 2-4 players, 20-30 minutesRRP: Â£29.99    Ice Cool.   Anyone whoâ€™s ever played Subbuteo will know the simple joy of flicking little plastic men around a table â€“ making masterful shots from improbable angles, hilariously failing to hit a ball thatâ€™s mere centimetres away. Ice Cool, from designer Brian Gomez, adopts a similar finger-flicking premise, but substitutes the football pitch for an Antarctic schoolhouse populated by anthropomorphic cartoon penguins. The game hands you control of a plastic penguin, which you will poke, prod and forcefully project through a series of interconnecting rooms; a 3D environment built from sections of the game box. You will score points by passing through doorways to collect fish, and with the penguin models weighted to allow for dramatic curves and rolls, itâ€™s possible to pull off some impressive trick shots, even launching your figure into the air to leap over walls or rival penguins that get in your way. Each round also sees one player take on the role of the â€œcatcherâ€, attempting to score points by colliding with other penguins. The end result feels like a blend of a furious race, a frantic game of tag and a tipsy night around the pool table at the student union. Yes, itâ€™s a bit gimmicky, but if youâ€™re after something quick and silly with huge toy appeal, then Ice Cool is great fun for kids, or for unashamedly immature grown-ups.   Ice Cool in action.  Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails 2-5 players, 90-120 minutesRRP: Â£59.99 Family-friendly train game Ticket to Ride is one of board gamingâ€™s great success stories. Since its release in 2004, itâ€™s sold more than 3m copies, and over the years itâ€™s spawned a series of spin-offs allowing players to build rail empires in different locations around the world. Rails and Sails is designer Alan R Moonâ€™s latest take on the gameâ€™s popular card-based formula, and it takes things to a new and much grander scale, with players competing on a global map to build worldwide networks of railways and shipping lanes. If you have played previous games in the series, you will find the core of the game largely unchanged. Players collect cards to claim routes on the board, secretly aiming to connect certain locations on the map to score bonus points. Youâ€™ll attempt to find the most efficient routes between cities and to block off the connections your opponents desperately need. The biggest change, though, is that you will need different types of cards to claim land- or sea-based routes. In effect, youâ€™re building two separate networks, and it feels a lot like playing two games of Ticket to Ride simultaneously. Itâ€™s a more mentally taxing take on the original gameâ€™s premise, but unfortunately it doesnâ€™t take long for this edition to come off the rails. The requirement to collect different cards means that you can spend several turns fishing for the ones you need before youâ€™re actually able to do anything, and it soon becomes frustrating. Rails and Sails adds length and complexity, but it offers little new in terms of gameplay. If youâ€™re new to Ticket to Ride, this isnâ€™t the place to jump aboard; youâ€™ll have much more fun with the original game. If youâ€™re already a fan, the existing map pack expansions bring more variety and better value for money. My recommendation: the excellent UK and Ireland expansion. Mystic Vale 2-4 players, 30 - 45 minutesRRP: Â£38.99    Mystic Vale. Photograph: PR Company Handout   Strategy card games such as Magic: The Gathering and Android: Netrunner are a cornerstone of gamer culture. Deep, complex and immersive, they challenge players to build and battle with customised decks, and with thousands of cards to choose from, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and abilities, they offer huge potential for tinkering and tactical experimentation. Mystic Vale, by designer John D Clair, aims to take this personalisation one step further. It casts players as druids attempting to rid a fantasy world of corrupting dark magic. But the gameâ€™s major innovation is its â€œcard-craftingâ€ system, which lets players build entirely new cards as they play.   Related: From Twisterâ€™s â€˜sex in a boxâ€™ to PokÃ©mon Goâ€™s new reality â€“ how games define the times   You will start the game with a set of basic cards housed in see-through plastic sleeves. Throughout the game, you will add new elements to these in the form of transparent overlays that lie on top of your cards and grant them new powers â€“ gaining you points, granting you new abilities or removing pesky corruption from your card pool. Itâ€™s a novel spin on the well-worn card game concept, and while experienced gamers will recognise elements from predecessors like Magic, Dominion, Splendor and even the casino mainstay Blackjack, the card-creation system is a new and exciting element. The game does come with a few flaws, though. Thereâ€™s little in the way of actual interaction between players, meaning that it can feel as though everyone at the table is immersed in their own individual game. While there are multiple deck-building strategies to choose from, it wonâ€™t take long to discover them all. Publisher AEG is planning a series of expansions, though, which should add some variety and replay-ability to whatâ€™s already a promising game.  Sneaky Cards No player limitRRP: Â£9.99    Sneaky Cards.   More of a social experiment than a game, Sneaky Cards challenges players to complete a series of quirky, off-beat tasks: take a selfie with a stranger, hide a card in a public place, make an impassioned speech in a crowded lift. When you complete a challenge, you will pass the associated card on to someone else, who then has to attempt the task themselves. The result is an ever-growing chain of players, some of whom will have been drawn into the game completely unsuspectingly. You will register your deck on the publisherâ€™s web site before you play, allowing you to track individual cards as they pass from person to person, and while some â€“ probably the majority â€“ will disappear without a trace, others will run on and on, injecting humour and spontaneity into peopleâ€™s lives as they go. Some cards even come with an altruistic bent, encouraging players to volunteer for a local organisation or buy someone a coffee, and any game that has the potential to increase my caffeine levels seems like something that ought to be encouraged.

"England face questions over makeup of attack â€¦ again Last time the quandary was how to accommodate Jimmy Anderson; this time it is Stuart Broad who is posing the questions â€¦ or at least some of them. Alastair Cook sounded doubtful when asked if Broadâ€™s injured foot will have recovered in time for the third Test but in a way his enforced absence may make life easier for the selectors because they could simply bring back Chris Woakes. However the perceived wisdom is that conditions in Mohali are the most likely to suit seam and if England are ever to revert to four seamers then this is the place they will do so. Therefore if Broad is fit then surely Woakes will replace Zafar Ansari. The Surrey man is a talented cricketer with an admirable attitude and it is too soon to write him off but he was a passenger in the second Test. Cook barely trusted him with the ball in the first innings â€“ he took none for 45 from 12 overs â€“ and did not bowl him at all in the second due to a back injury, while he managed only four runs. If Broad is not fit then Ansariâ€™s poor performances raise further questions: do they stick to three spinners and bring in the 39-year-old Gareth Batty â€“ a better bowler than Ansari in any case â€“ or ask Steven Finn or Jake Ball to come in cold? Dan Lucas   Related: Indiaâ€™s spinners send England tumbling to 246-run defeat in second Test   Adil Rashid is in for the long haul Adil Rashidâ€™s performance in the first Test suggested he is â€“ finally, at 28 â€“ coming of age as a Test spinner. In fairness to the Yorkshire leggie, this seven-Test winter across first Bangladesh and India is the first time conditions have necessitated an extended run in the side but he has he surely convinced the last of the impartial doubters. Never mind the ill-advised waft with the bat in Englandâ€™s final-day collapse, he was his sideâ€™s best bowler and is worth a place even in less spin-friendly conditions. The six wickets were impressive but equally instructive was the fact Cook turned to him, rather than the senior Moeen Ali â€“ at first change in Indiaâ€™s second innings. He responded brilliantly with four for 82 and dramatically reducing the number of â€œgimmeâ€ balls, for which he has rightly been criticised, even when India looked to accelerate. With Moeen clearly worth his place on the strength of his batting, and Woakes and Ben Stokes adding further all-round options, there is no reason Rashid should not be in the side for the first Test of the summer. DL   Englandâ€™s top three can bat time A side holding on for a draw overseas is becoming an increasingly rare sight, let alone in India. In 38 Tests in 2016, only twice have a side saved or won a match batting last after conceding a first-innings lead: Sri Lanka, in the rain-affected draw at Lordâ€™s and India in the first Test of this series in Rajkot. England did not get close to emulating these feats in the second Test and fell some way short of South Africaâ€™s ultimately futile 143.1-over epic effort in Delhi last year. However the match was lost when they collapsed in the evening session on day two rather than in the fourth innings. Cook, Haseeb Hameed and Joe Root survived a cumulative 439 balls in Englandâ€™s final dig, showing the art of batting time to save a Test is not lost, while Moeen, Stokes and Jonny Bairstow have all shown they can rein in their stroke-playing instincts. The problem lies at No4, where Ben Duckett does not yet possess the technique for Test cricket, while there are few signs Jos Buttler does and Gary Ballanceâ€™s problems are well documented; England are missing James Taylor more than they may have expected. DL Duckett needs a break Ben Duckett does not have the best name for a struggling batsman. His first Test duck gave some easy work to headline writers â€“ and probably Englandâ€™s selection panel too. They usually like to give a batsman one Test too many rather than one too few but there is a compelling argument that dropping Duckett would be an act of kindness. His low scores are less of a worry than the manner of them; Ravi Ashwin is the Kumble to his Richard Blakey, and it is hard to see Duckett making runs in this series. He is an outrageous talent who will be back â€“ just like Buttler, his likely replacement, who was left out in similar circumstances in the UAE a year ago. Buttler has played only one four-day match since then and is yet to crack first-class cricket with the bat, never mind Test matches. A personal preference would be for England to fly over a spin-playing specialist like Sam Billings, as Test results are far more important than the ego and pride of selectors and players. Buttler does at least have one thing on his side â€“ his genius â€“ and playing him as a specialist batsman may help him master the red-ball game. Rob Smyth Thereâ€™s more to India than Ashwin and Jadeja It was expected, not unreasonably, that Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja would be Indiaâ€™s biggest threats with the ball in this series. They remain so but the evidence of the second Test is there is plenty more to fear. Mohammed Shami, one of those rare fast bowlers who is at his best in Asia, bowled thrillingly with the new and old balls, while the two Yadavs â€“ the paceman Umesh and the debutant off-spinner Jayant â€“ also gave England plenty of problems. The batsmen could never relax. Jayantâ€™s delivery to bowl Stokes, which drifted in and spat off the pitch, was like watching Graeme Swann at his best. India donâ€™t just have five bowlers; they have a proper five-man attack. RS",1
"Stasi In The White HousePaul Craig Roberts Fifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy pledged: Ich bin ein Berliner. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan challenged: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. Obamas speech was delivered to a relatively small, specially selected audience of invitees. Even so, Obama spoke from behind bullet proof glass. Obamas speech will go down in history as the most hypocritical of all time. Little wonder that the audience was there by invitation only. A real audience would have hooted Obama out of Berlin. Perhaps the most hypocritical of all of Obamas statements was his proposal that the US and Russia reduce their nuclear weapons by one-third. The entire world, and certainly the Russians, saw through this ploy. The US is currently surrounding Russia with anti-ballistic missiles on Russias borders and hopes to leverage this advantage by talking Russia into reducing its weapons, thereby making it easier for Washington to target them. Obamas proposal is clearly intended to weaken Russias nuclear deterrent and ability to resist US hegemony. Obama spoke lofty words of peace, while beating the drums of war in Syria and Iran. Witness Obamas aggressive policies of surrounding Russia with missile bases and establishing new military bases in the Pacific Ocean with which to confront China. The tyrants speech of spectacular hypocrisy elicited from the invited audience applause on 36 occasions. Like so many others, Germans proved themselves willing to be used for Washingtons propaganda purposes. Here was Obama, who consistently lies, speaking of eternal truth. Here was Obama, who enabled Wall Street to rob the American and European peoples and who destroyed Americans civil liberties and the lives of vast numbers of Iraqis, Afghans, Yemenis, Libyans, Pakistanis, Syrians, and others, speaking of the yearnings of justice. Obama equates demands for justice with terrorism. Here was Obama, who has constructed an international spy network and a domestic police state, speaking of the yearnings for freedom. Here was Obama, president of a country that has initiated wars or military action against six countries since 2001 and has three more Muslim countriesSyria, Lebanon, and Iranin its crosshairs and perhaps several more in Africa, speaking of the yearnings of peace that burns in the human heat, but clearly not in Obamas heart. Obama has turned America into a surveillance state that has far more in common with Stasi East Germany than with the America of the Kennedy and Reagan eras. Strange, isnt it, that freedom was gained in East Germany and lost in America. At the Brandenburg Gate, Obama invoked the pledge of nations to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but Obama continues to violate human rights both at home and abroad. Obama has taken hypocrisy to new heights. He has destroyed US civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. In place of a government accountable to law, he has turned law into a weapon in the hands of the government. He has intimidated a free press and prosecutes whistleblowers who reveal his governments crimes. He makes no objection when American police brutalize peacefully protesting citizens. His government intercepts and stores in National Security Agency computers every communication of every American and also the private communications of Europeans and Canadians, including the communications of the members of the governments, the better to blackmail those with secrets. Obama sends in drones or assassins to murder people in countries with which the US is not at war, and his victims on most occasions turn out to be women, children, farmers, and village elders. Obama kept Bradley Manning in solitary confinement for nearly a year assaulting his human dignity in an effort to break him and obtain a false confession. In defiance of the US Constitution, Obama denied Manning a trial for three years. On Obamas instructions, London denies Julian Assange free passage to his political asylum in Ecuador. Assange has become a modern-day Cardinal Mindszenty. [Jozsef Mindszenty was the leader of the Hungarian Catholic Church who sought refuge from Soviet oppression in the US Embassy in Budapest. Denied free passage by the Soviets, the Cardinal lived in the US Embassy for 15 years as a symbol of Soviet oppression.] This is the Obama who asked at the orchestrated event at the Brandenburg Gate: Will we live free or in chains? Under governments that uphold our universal rights, or regimes that suppress them? In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will, or in closed societies that suffocate the soul? When the Berlin Wall came down, the Stasi Spy State that suffocates the soul moved to Washington. The Stasi is alive and well in the Obama regime.

"Kenyas Recent Ban on All GMOs Draws Cheers and JeersThe Minister of Public Health and Sanitation has noted with great great concern the ongoing debate over the safety of GMO foods In a gutsy move, Kenyas government has banned all imported GMO goods effective immediately. They are also suspending all sales of genetically modified produce and foods with GM ingredients until health safety is confirmed. The ban is not permanent, however it depends on what evidence the ministry concludes. Biotechnology research can continue. On November 8th, Health Minister Beth Mugo made the announcement with Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki present and also said: Taking a better-safe-than-sorry approach, she added, Where there is apprehension and uncertainty regarding the safety of food products, precaution to protect the health of the people must be undertaken. This new health fear is most likely a result of the now famous French GMO studyin September, complete with pictures of grotesquely tumored rats. Or maybe even rising suspicions and admissions of biotech scientist knowledge of an infertility gene and a coordinating rise of infertility and miscarriages in humans but definitely, undeniably those issues and death in cattle eating GMO feed. One biotech scientist wrote to Natural Society, telling them it would be awesome if this **** causes infertility because hes among those who fiercely believe the world is overpopulated, and goes on to say that GMO is saving the planet. Despite hints of ultimate depopulation efforts and major safety concerns, it is not surprising that many biotech researchers, universities, farmers, students, and consumers are unhappy about the decision. Theyve got investments riding on genetic modification in fear of a growing (deliberate) food crisis and hopes of economic uptick. They are also perplexed because, until now, GMO efforts enjoyed friendly laws.Dr Silas Obukosia, Director Regulatory Affairs at Africa Harvest thought the ban was misinformed and hindered Kenyas ability to increase food production: But take a good look at the names of those institutions bias much? It is reminiscent of our FDA and USDA allowing Monsanto to conduct its own safety studies. The pressure is on with headlines like Kenya risks losing billions over GMO ban. Those are hypothetical billions of course it was spoken at a big Ag Biotechnology forum and focused on Africa being a transit point for GM food with other countries. Arguments against the ban focus on food security, the economy, and wasted money not sincere public health. While those will cry unfair what we dont want to see in Africa is whats happening in India, where tens of thousands of farmers have committed suicide, some by dousing themselves with Roundup-ready pesticides and setting fire, making one last statement about their betrayers. They risked Monsanto crops and went destitute when the crops to end world hunger failed to yield. They, their families and their communities lost more than just their initial investments. Ms. Mugo and the cabinet have more true public safety in mind than many will ever realize for some time to come. Lets hope the ban holds during their safety confirmations if the ban is lifted do you think it will make the news? Theyve already taken a big step with the ban and nipping disease and corporate takeover in the genetic bud. This news follows the recent GMO suspension in Russia(following the French study) and Perus legislative 10-year-ban finally coming into effect.

"More than two decades have passed since the Douglass family of Pocatello and the Bzymek family of Derby, NY faced off on the syndicated game show Family Feud. But instead of being tempered by time, the feud sparked in November 1979 has grown increasingly bitter with each passing year, and show producers say the two families have reached a level of acrimony unseen elsewhere in the program's 29-year history. Douglass- and Bzymek-family heads of households recall their 1979 TV appearance (below). 'I haven't forgotten what those Bzymeks did to us,' said Porter Douglass, the losing family's team leader. 'They stole control of the board in the double-dollar round and took our bank.' Porter added: 'They walked away with a cool $5,000, and we were humiliated on national television. Name a bunch of inbred jackasses that deserve a punch in the face. Survey says... The Bzymeks!' The Bzymek-Douglass appearance began like a typical episode, with plenty of cheering and good-natured ribbing between the two families. As the game progressed, however, the jibes became more personal and mean-spirited, nearly culminating in a fistfight between Douglass and Tim Bzymek, when Douglass called then 14-year-old Jenny Bzymek a 'stupid tramp' as the families were leaving the stage. 'He insulted my blood,' Bzymek said when asked about the incident. 'If you are a loser who can't name the top five things you'd find in a refrigerator, don't take it out on my daughter. Especially when your son is a four-eyes who takes two minutes to decide whether to play or pass!' The mutual rancor, which has endured five presidencies, a war, and four hosts, shows no sign of abating. Last year, when Jenny's daughter Katie graduated from high school, she received a card from the Douglasses. 'Where did you get into school, Katie?' the card read. 'Survey says... community college!' 'That was completely uncalled for,' Bzymek said. 'That was a day of celebration. They could've come down the week after the show and beat me with a baseball bat, and that would've at least been honorable, but this? Too much. They ruined Katie's special day, all because we cleaned their clocks on television.' The families were brought back to the show in 1999 for a 'Greatest Contestants' special, but the episode never aired. According to Jason Lowitt, a producer who witnessed the taping, Douglass and Bzymek had to be physically separated by host Louie Anderson during the face-off round, after Porter guessed the number-one answer and took control of the board. 'We came into round four on top, but we lost again because triple points in the fourth fucked us,' Douglass said, referring to a controversial rule repealed in 2002. 'I blame Louie Anderson. Richard Dawson never would have let that happen under his watch.' Bzymek's wife Beth was reached at home and asked to comment on the ongoing strife. 'The Douglass family?' Beth said. 'We asked 100 people who was most likely to lose his sales job for failing to meet his quota. You heard me, Sally Douglass. I'm talking about your no-good husband. If you want to do something about it, step on up. I've got a .45-caliber parting gift loaded and waiting.' Despite many such threats, the conflict has thus far been limited to menacing letters, inflammatory e-mails, and crank phone calls. 'People ask us when this will end,' Sally Douglass said. 'This will end when the Bzymeks join former host Ray Combs in the Fast Money round in the sky.' 'Three strikes and control of the board will pass to us!' Sally added. Tony Cohen, CEO of FremantleMedia, which produces the current incarnation of Feud, said his company is taking great pains to prevent future contestant altercations. 'We are concerned that some guests may feel compelled to maximize their fleeting time in the public eye by causing a scene,' Cohen said. 'That's why we have begun doing background checks on all contestants and searching them for weapons when they enter the studio. We don't want a repeat of the 2002 domestic disturbance which sent four Stenzels to the hospital.' ",0
"NEW YORKThe Food and Drug Administration today approved the sale of the drug PharmAmorin, a prescription tablet developed by Pfizer to treat chronic distrust of large prescription-drug manufacturers. Pfizer executives characterized the FDA's approval as a 'godsend' for sufferers of independent-thinking-related mental-health disorders. PharmAmorin, now relieving distrust of large pharmaceutical conglomerates in pharmacies nationwide. 'Many individuals today lack the deep, abiding affection for drug makers that is found in healthy people, such as myself,' Pfizer CEO Hank McKinnell said. 'These tragic disorders are reaching epidemic levels, and as a company dedicated to promoting the health, well-being, and long life of our company's public image, it was imperative that we did something to combat them.' Although many psychotropic drugs impart a generalized feeling of well-being, PharmAmorin is the first to induce and focus intense feelings of affection externally, toward for-profit drug makers. Pfizer representatives say that, if taken regularly, PharmAmorin can increase affection for and trust in its developers by as much as 96.5 percent. 'Out of a test group of 180, 172 study participants reported a dramatic rise in their passion for pharmaceutical companies,' said Pfizer director of clinical research Suzanne Frost. 'And 167 asked their doctors about a variety of prescription medications they had seen on TV.' Frost said a small percentage of test subjects showed an interest in becoming lobbyists for one of the top five pharmaceutical companies, and several browsed eBay for drug-company apparel. PharmAmorin, available in 100-, 200-, and 400-mg tablets, is classified as a critical-thinking inhibitor, a family of drugs that holds great promise for the estimated 20 million Americans who suffer from Free-Thinking Disorder. Pfizer will also promote PharmAmorin in an aggressive, $34.6 million print and televised ad campaign. One TV ad, set to debut during next Sunday's 60 Minutes telecast, shows a woman relaxing in her living room and reading a newspaper headlined 'Newest Drug Company Scandal Undermines Public Trust.' The camera zooms into the tangled neural matter of her brain, revealing a sticky black substance and a purplish gas. The narrator says, 'She may show no symptoms, but in her brain, irrational fear and dislike of global pharmaceutical manufacturers is overwhelming her very peace of mind.' After a brief summary of PharmAmorin's benefits, the commercial concludes with the woman flying a kite across a sunny green meadow, the Pfizer headquarters gleaming in the background. PharmAmorin is the first drug of its kind, but Pfizer will soon face competition from rival pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company is developing its own pro-pharmaceutical-company medication, Brismysquibicin, which will induce warm feelings not just for drug corporations in general, but solely for Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'A PharmAmorin user could find himself gravitating toward the products of a GlaxoSmithKline or Eli Lilly,' BMS spokesman Andrew Fike said. 'This could seriously impede the patient's prescription-drug-market acceptance, or worse, Pfizer's profits in the long run.' 'Brismysquibicin will be cheaper to produce and therefore far more affordable to those on fixed incomes,' Fike added. The news of an affordable skepticism-inhibitor was welcomed by New York physician Christine Blake-Mann, who runs a free clinic in Spanish Harlem. 'A lot of my patients are very leery of the medical establishment,' Blake-Mann said. 'This will help them feel better about it, and save money at the same time.' PharmAmorin's side effects include nausea, upset stomach, and ignoring the side effects of prescription drug medication. ",0
"Your informative piece (One in seven takeaways fail hygiene tests, 24 September) mentions that the Food Standards Agency ranks all food providers with a score of zero to five. In Wales, all food businesses are legally required to display their score in a prominent place in all entrances so that potential customers are aware of it and can make an informed decision on whether to enter. There is no such statutory requirement in England and it is left to the discretion of individual food business operators. InÂ the light of the appalling hygiene standards in many food premises in England, revealed in your article, perhaps it is time for ministers to follow the good practice in Wales and make it mandatory for food businesses to display their scores on the door.

"According to a University of CaliforniaSan Diego study released Monday, sexism is rampant throughout the natural world, particularly among the highest classes of vertebrates. One of the millions of lionesses trapped in an abusive relationship. 'When we first decided to examine attitudes and behaviors toward gender roles among non-humans, we were wholly unprepared for what we would find,' said Jennifer Tannen, leader of the UCSD research team, a joint venture between the school's zoology and women's studies departments. 'Females living in the wild routinely fall victim to everything from stereotyping to exclusion from pack activities to sexual harassment.' Nowhere is the natural world's gender inequity more transparent, Tannen said, than in the unfair burden females assume for the rearing of offspring. 'Take the behavior of the ring-neck pheasant,' Tannen said. 'After mating, the male immediately abandons the hen, leaving her responsible for the total care for the chicks. For the single mother-to-be, there is no assistance, either in the form of a partner or child support. Nor is there any legal recourse. It's despicable.' Tannen said pheasants are typical of the natural world, where a mere 5 percent of animal species mate for life. Among species that do form lasting pairs, the situation barely improves: Females must remain close to the nest to incubate eggs, nurse, and keep watch over the burrow while males are free to go off hunting and fishing with their friends. 'The sexist attitude that child-rearing is 'women's work' is prevalent throughout nature and has been for generations, probably since reptiles first developed mammalian characteristics in the Triassic period,' Tannen said. 'Sadly, most creatures never pause to challenge these woefully outdated gender roles.' Tannen stressed the need to hold high those rare examples of species that do form caring, mutually supportive relationships. 'Wolves, beavers, gibbons, and a small African antelope known as a dik-dik all live in stable, monogamous pairs,' Tannen said. 'Other animals need to look to them as positive models if we are to have any hope of one day creating an ecosystem of understanding and respect.' More seriously, in addition to an unfair division of labor, nature is rife with sexual abuse and harassment. The UCSD study estimates that in 2001 alone, more than 170 trillion cases of abuse occurred in the world's forests, grasslands, and oceansall of them unreported. 'During the act of mating, the female moose is subject to excessive biting, nipping, and herding,' Tannen said. 'The male has no qualms about using sheer, brute force to overpower his sex partner, and the female, accustomed to this sort of rough treatment after millions of years of it, doesn't even realize there's something wrong.' 'Then, when it's time for the bull moose to complete the sexual act,' Tannen continued, 'it's over in about five seconds, with no regard to female pleasure whatsoever. Typical.' Adding insult to injury, Tannen said, the bull moose then heads off to mate with dozens more females over a period of two to three weeks, justifying his behavior as 'part of the Mardi Gras-like atmosphere of 'mating season.'' With other species, darker situations unfold. 'To mate, the male Galapagos tortoise simply immobilizes the female with his weight, which, as far as I'm concerned, qualifies as non-consensual sex,' Tannen says. 'Female southern elephant seals gather in large groups during mating season, and each group has a small handful of males who control them like a harem. It's sick.' A cock reinforces the poultry world's sexist, male-dominated social hierarchy. When female animals refuse to play along with prescribed gender roles, Tannen said, they are demonized. For example, female foxes, known throughout the animal kingdom for their aggressiveness, are labeled 'vixen.' 'We've all heard the lurid tales about the female black-widow spider, who kills and eats her mate,' Tannen said. 'The truth is, male spiders encourage their partners to kill them because it increases the time spent mating and, thus, the number of eggs fertilized by his sperm. But no one condemns the male for his part in this destructive relationship.' UCSD researchers identified 24 distinct male behaviors designed to perpetuate gender inequity and preserve the prevailing power structure. Among these dominance-asserting behaviors are chest-puffing, plumage-spreading, and antler growth. The UCSD study is not without its detractors. Glen Otis Brown, author of Forced To Strut: Reverse Sexism In The Animal World, countered that male animals are victims of 'the beauty myth' as much as females. 'When given a choice, female green tree frogs gravitate toward males that call the loudest and most often,' Brown said. 'Female Poecilia reticulata [guppies] go straight to the most brightly colored males. But when males evolve exaggerated secondary sexual traits to attract the opposite sex, suddenly they're the bad guys.' Tannen conceded that both genders have suffered as a result of sexism. 'Other than sexual size dimorphism due to same-sex competition, males benefit little from the gender inequity that so strongly favors them,' Tannen said. 'In a world where interactions are rooted in competition, not cooperation, both females and males are being denied the right to form meaningful relationships.' Annie Secunda, a Boston-based females'-rights advocate, said swift action must be taken to address the problem of sexism within the animal kingdom. 'We need to provide tigresses, hens, and all other females in nature with outreach programs and support networks,' Secunda said. 'We also need to impose standards through intervention. The males of all species need to hear loud and clear the message that this kind of animal behavior is not acceptable.' Secunda conducts numerous workshops aimed at creating female-friendly biomes and promoting the health and positive self-image of females on both land and in the sea. She also strongly advocates the legalization of infanticide, which would enable females to devour their newborn offspring when resources are limited. Secunda spent much of 2001 in the Amazon rainforest, working to create safe spaces for female animals. These efforts, however, yielded mixed results: Females have avoided the lighted walkways she built in several dangerously dense areas, and leaflets encouraging females to learn how their own bodies work were ultimately used to line dens for the rainy season. Far from discouraged, Secunda said she plans to embark on an intensive study of the sexuality of flora. 'Multicellular plants alternate sexually reproducing and asexually reproducing generations, with each plant producing both male and female gametes,' Secunda said. 'It seems many plants have moved past conventional notions of male-female gender altogether. It's so liberating, I can't help but have hope for all those so-called 'higher' species of animals.' ",0

"Walter Braunfels lived through the catastrophes of two world wars in Europe, and composed in a period when so many of the certainties that had sustained music for the previous two centuries had eroded. But his own works rarely show any sign of those upheavals. Right up to his death in 1954, Braunfelsâ€™ music remained rooted in late Romanticism, even though his take on the 19th century was always an entirely personal one. Thereâ€™s very little stylistic distance between the earliest of the five song-cycles for soprano and orchestra here â€“ the Three Chinese Songs of 1914, settings of translations by Hans Bethge from the same collection that Mahler had quarried a few years earlier for Das Lied von der Erde â€“ and the last â€“ the Four Japanese Songs from 1945, again to Bethge texts. The later works donâ€™t have the lyrical freshness of the Chinese Songs, which Camilla Nylundâ€™s wonderfully refined performance reveals as a neglected treasure. Nylund also sings the five Romantic Songs â€“ settings of Brentano and Eichendorff which Braunfels began during the first world war and completed during the second.  Ricarda Merbeth is the less striking soloist in the Japanese Songs and the Shakespearean Death of Cleopatra â€“ more an extended song than a scena â€“ while Genia KÃ¼hmeier gets the rather enigmatic Die Gott minnende Seele, settings of mystical poems by Mechthild von Magdeburg in which Braunfels pares his language down to its expressive core.",1
"I was a deeply unhappy child. Hatred of school, my parentsâ€™ disastrously bad marriage and an upbringing in the kind of church that was big on rules and low on compassion, added up to me being extremely angry and withdrawn, pretty much until I was able to leave home. A girl like that looks for a place to hole up and wait until childhood is over. Some kids find escape through computers. Some find escape with their friends â€“ but because I refused to go school, I didnâ€™t have any.   Related: A moment that changed me: being sent away to my loveless boarding school | Kate Morris   For a time my mother worked during the early evenings at Index, a catalogue shop inside a shopping centre. I didnâ€™t like being in the house alone, so often I would walk to work with her, and sit on the benches outside the shop during her shift. Sometimes I got bored or cold and walked around the town centre, looking in windows. Other times, I went to the library. For these hours, during the evenings when my mother was working, and more often when I was supposed to be at school, I would find a chair next to the huge, iron, clanking radiators and read. Because my family werenâ€™t bookish and I wasnâ€™t at school, I had no idea what I was supposed to choose. I couldnâ€™t tell the worthy books from the trash and I didnâ€™t know which you were supposed to start with: fiction or non-fiction. I never remember a librarian speaking to me, either to advise me what to read or to ask me why I wasnâ€™t at school. Nobody offered me a library ticket so I could take the books home. Harris Library librarians of the mid-1990s â€“ if you are reading this, Iâ€™m so, so grateful for that: for being, just for those few stolen hours, left entirely and completely alone.    â€˜Iâ€™d found my own place to wait out childhood, which didnâ€™t last forever.â€™ Jenn Ashworth outside her former school. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian   One day, aged 12, I arrived in the morning, tear-stained and exhausted after another hour-long argument about going to school. I couldnâ€™t explain why I wouldnâ€™t go: Iâ€™d be an adult before it would make sense to me. That day, I ran away to the library, and found a new shelf: â€œteenage fictionâ€, they called it. Iâ€™d leapt from Enid Blyton to Agatha Christie and chewed through most of Ruth Rendell and Stephen King without knowing there was something in the middle.   Related: A moment that changed me: being abused on the street about my weight | Sofie Hagen   The first book I picked up had an intriguing title: Fly Pie and the Seventeen Million Pound Baby (itâ€™s since been republished as The Baby and Fly Pie). I found my seat by the radiator and started to read. Except I forgot I was sad and scared and lonely, because I wasnâ€™t in that library any more, I had stepped, instead, into that dark dystopian world the author Melvin Burgess had created for Sham and Fly â€“ â€œrubbish kids, losers and orphansâ€ â€“ abandoned by their mother in a sprawling, impossible city. Desperate and alone in a dangerous world of adults, the pair fall in with a Fagin figure who sets them to work picking through a rubbish tip. There, they take a priceless baby from a dying man. The book is strange and frightening and violent: it felt like the most real thing I had ever read. Why should Sham and Flyâ€™s bleak world comfort me, in mine? I looked up from the last page and it was lunchtime. I wasnâ€™t hungry. I turned back to the first page and started again and Iâ€™ve never done that before or since, but I wanted to find out how Burgess had done it: how heâ€™d stopped and stretched time, how heâ€™d make a crack in the world just wide enough for someone like me to escape through it. Itâ€™s a time for cliches: my heart was in my throat. By the end of the second reading, the school day was over. I headed home, and something had changed.

"The finding that Rolling Stone magazine defamed a University of Virginia administrator is the latest in a series of legal decisions that experts say signal a hardening attitude to the media and other institutions.  A jury on Friday found that Rolling Stone and writer Sabrina Rudin Erdely met the extraordinary standard of acting with â€œactual maliceâ€ in their depictions of Nicole Eramo, the universityâ€™s former associate dean. In her lawsuit for $7.5m, Eramo claimed the publicationâ€™s story cast her as the â€œchief villainâ€ who â€œsilencedâ€ Jackie or â€œdiscouragedâ€ her from reporting her alleged rape to police. The story published in November 2014 told the story of a University of Virginia student identified only as â€œJackieâ€ who claimed that seven members of Phi Kappa Psi raped her in a gruesome fraternity initiation. The story initially spurred an outpouring of outrage until it fell apart under scrutiny from other news outlets. Within weeks, Rolling Stone had to apologize for not thoroughly fact-checking it. Jurors in this case had to find that the magazineâ€™s reporter and editors not only made a mistake but had knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. â€œIt has to be egregious,â€ said Samantha Barbas, a law professor specializing in media at the University at Buffalo. â€œThe press has to know that something is false and print it anyway.â€ The verdict comes on the heels of several recent high-profile cases where juries have found against institutions in cases involving invasion or privacy or defamation issues. Last month the News & Observer of Raleigh was ordered to pay about $6m in a state bureau of investigation agentâ€™s libel lawsuit. Earlier this year a jury in St Petersburg, Florida, delivered a $115m verdict against Gawker Media after it posted a sex tape of Hulk Hogan with his best friendâ€™s wife. The verdict forced the sale of the company, and last week Hogan and Gawkerâ€™s former owners settled for $31m â€“ but not before the now-defunct site filed for bankruptcy.  A month earlier, US sportscaster Erin Andrews was awarded $55m against Marriott Hotels after a Tennessee jury found the chain had not protected her from being filmed in the shower by a stalker. Barbas argued that the series of decisions signal that juries, reflecting public sentiment, are â€œdisenchanted with freedom of speechâ€ since many had personally experienced, through social media, the damage that online speech can have. â€œWeâ€™ve entered an anti-media cycle and weâ€™re seeing people, particularly public figures, getting a lot more litigious about what appears in the media, whether thatâ€™s libel or invasion of privacy.â€ At the same time, Barbas said, â€œPublic figures are becoming more confident juries will be more sympathetic to them.â€ Unlike the Gawker case, which claimed invasion of privacy, Eramo sued the magazine for allegedly casting her as the â€œchief villainâ€ in its article. Because the judge ruled that Eramo was a â€œlimited-purposeâ€ public figure, she couldnâ€™t simply claim that Rolling Stone was negligent in its reporting â€“ she had to argue that the publication acted with â€œactual maliceâ€. While Rolling Stone went to great lengths to unpick the failures of its reporting and fact-checking, including commissioning a report from the Columbia School of Journalism, it did not retract its characterization of Eramo.  Mary-Rose Papandrea, a University of North Carolina law professor, said the greatest surprise in the case was that â€œthere wasnâ€™t a greater awareness to the high risk of litigationâ€. â€œThis can only happen when journalists are too trusting in their sources and seemed to be hiding their heads in the sand to the truthfulness of what theyâ€™re publishing,â€ Papandrea said. In finding Rolling Stone liable, jurors accepted Eramoâ€™s claim that Erdely, the reporter, acted with actual malice on six claims â€“ two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the storyâ€™s publication. Barbas said the statements in the original article went from being inaccurate to libelous when Rolling Stone republished the article with corrections. â€œRolling Stone knew that Jackie was not a credible source yet despite that they published the story and let it stay on their website. They reaffirmed the truth of it despite, by that point, having serious doubts about Jackieâ€™s credibility. So that was enough to constitute actual malice.â€ In one objectionable statement, Erdely wrote that Eramo had a â€œnonreactionâ€ when she heard from Jackie that two other women were also raped at the same fraternity. Another was Erdelyâ€™s statement to the Washington Post days after the story was published that the University of Virginia administration chose not to act on Jackieâ€™s allegations â€œin any wayâ€. Barbas believes the consequences of this verdict could be farther-reaching than the Gawker verdict, which was based on the broadcast of a sex tape on a site known for sensationalistic or gossipy material. â€œItâ€™s not a sex tape, itâ€™s reporting on a legitimate subject. For a jury to say thereâ€™s actual malice â€“ a reckless disregard of the truth â€“ is pretty strong and thatâ€™s why this may have a stronger impact on the media than the Gawker case.â€ For Rolling Stone, once at the forefront of 60s social upheavals, the verdict will come as a bitter blow. Not only has its reputation suffered, but it still faces a $25m defamation lawsuit from the University of Virginiaâ€™s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity â€“ where Jackie claimed her sexual assault took place. That case is set to go to trial next year. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

"New Media Shield Law: Does Not Protect WikiLeaks or Independent BloggersMadison Ruppert Many current and former government officials have expressed contempt for anything even remotely resembling investigative journalism, as seen in the case of a former Obama adviser who argued that Glenn Greenwald is not a journalist. Even media professionals have expressed similar opinions, with one senior journalist for Time saying he cant wait to justify a drone strike on Julian Assange of WikiLeaks. The definition of who can be considered a journalist was heavily debated in the Judiciary Committee this summer. At the time, multiple senators, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) were concerned that a shield law could be used to protect WikiLeaks and similar groups. The world has changed. Were very careful in this bill to distinguish journalists from those who shouldnt be protected, WikiLeaks and all those, and weve ensured that, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at the time, according to Politico. But there are people who write and do real journalism, in different ways than were used to. They should not be excluded from this bill. However, the new amendment to the legislation, brokered by Schumer, indeed limits the protection significantly. Under the bill, a journalist would be defined as an individual who is in contract with or employed by a media outlet for at least one year within the last 20 years or three months within the last five years. That would leave out anyone who only works as unpaid journalist outside of what the government would consider a traditional media outlet. Indeed, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation noted: One positive aspect of the law is that it would protect any person deemed appropriate by a federal judge so long as the newsgathering practices of that person have been consistent with the law. Unfortunately, that leaves the call up to a federal judge. If the journalist happens to be exposing corruption in the federal court system, that wouldnt necessarily be an appealing arrangement. Above all this, there is something even more troubling about the whole proceeding. As Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) rightly pointed out, the fact that the Senate is even debating who can be considered real reporters and legitimate journalists should be chilling to us all. However, Cornyn apparently didnt have a problem doing just that: Indeed, it is quite obviously flawed given that it would remove protection when journalists most need it in cases involving national security.

"The State Supreme Court has signed off on a new education funding law that increases state aid to poor school districts. The justices issued a brief order Tuesday saying that the Legislature â€œhas currently satisfiedâ€ the courtâ€™s orders on education funding by approving the measure last week. The decision ends a threat that public schools would be shut down after Thursday. Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, signed the school finance measure into law on Monday. Lawyers for the state and lawyers for four school districts that had sued the state submitted a joint statement saying that the measure complied with the courtâ€™s dictates. The justices ruled last month that the funding system remained unfair to poor school districts. (AP)Lawyers for an Air Force officer charged with rape, adultery and other crimes are making the novel argument that the military ban on extramarital sex discriminates against heterosexuals because it does not specifically include same-sex couples. Lawyers for Col. Eugene Caughey of the Air Force challenged the adultery provision Monday in a military court at Peterson Air Force Base. They argued that the half-dozen adultery charges against Colonel Caughey should be thrown out because they violate his constitutional rights. Military prosecutors argued the adultery ban does apply to same-sex couples. The judge has not ruled on the argument. Colonel Caughey is charged with raping a woman at Schriever Air Force Base, also in Colorado, in late 2014 or early 2015. He is also accused of committing adultery several times, photographing his exposed genitals while in uniform and groping women. His court-martial is scheduled in August. He is a 24-year Air Force veteran and was formerly second in charge of the 50th Space Wing at Schriever. (AP)Voters will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana in California.

And this wasn't a stranger, folks -- Mrs. Hassan lived next door to my parents for 56 years, saved my father from a heart attack when he collapsed on his NordicTrack, and was the only person who showed up to support me during the 1977 Women's Collegiate Rugby National Championships. But did that sway me? ABSOLUTELY NOT. A terrorist is a terrorist. I marched over to her house last Tuesday afternoon, returned a casserole dish she'd brought over, then took her neck straight to the carpet.

"Young barristers are heavily in debt and becoming vulnerable to depression, the chair of the Bar Councilâ€™s youth wing warns.

Nye, who is chair of the young barristersâ€™ committee of the Bar Council of England and Wales, will admit that she herself had suffered from anxiety and depression.  â€œI have lost a close friend who took her own life, in part under the strain that this job and circumstances can place on people,â€ she will tell the conference.    Related: Qualifying as a barrister 'may cost new students up to Â£127,000'   â€œTodayâ€™s cohort of young barristers is in a particularly vulnerable position.

Young criminal and family barristers are receiving the lowest of sums for carrying out important work, and many are struggling to maintain a living.â€ Nye, who is a member of Landmark Chambers in London, will add: â€œParts of the media have reports almost daily where lawyers are criticised for the work they do and characterised as a scourge on society. â€œYoung barristers live in deeply uncertain and difficult times â€¦ And it is difficult against that background not to feel somewhat lost and somewhat depressed.â€ She will point to the Wellbeing at the Bar report published last year which highlighted high levels of stress and anxiety felt by barristers. Nye will say: â€œThe survey found that one in three barristers finds it difficult to control or stop worrying. One in six barristers said that they felt low in spirits most of the time.â€",1
"I would like to express my gratitude to Jared Kushner for reviving interest in my 2006 book, The Price of Admission. I have never met or spoken with him, and itâ€™s rare in this life to find such a selfless benefactor. Of course, I doubt he became Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and consigliere merely to boost my lagging sales, but still, Iâ€™m thankful.   Related: Who is Jared Kushner? Trump's son-in-law at center of transition team drama   My book exposed a grubby secret of American higher education: that the rich buy their underachieving childrenâ€™s way into elite universities with massive, tax-deductible donations. It reported that New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5m to Harvard University not long before his son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school, which at the time accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out of 20.) I also quoted administrators at Jaredâ€™s high school, who described him as a less-than-stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvardâ€™s decision. â€œThere was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard,â€™â€™ a former official at the Frisch school in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. â€œHis GPA [grade point average] did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought, for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not.â€™â€™     The son-in-law behind the throne: Jared Kushnerâ€™s rise and rise  Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email on Thursday that â€œthe allegationâ€™â€™ that Charles Kushnerâ€™s gift to Harvard was related to Jaredâ€™s admission â€œis and always has been falseâ€. His parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner, â€œare enormously generous and have donated over $100m to universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honours.â€™â€™ (About 90% of Jaredâ€™s 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honours.) My Kushner discoveries were an offshoot of my research for a chapter on Harvard donors. Somebody had slipped me a document I had long coveted: the membership list of Harvardâ€™s Committee on University Resources. The university wooed more than 400 of its biggest givers and most promising prospects by putting them on this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be wined, dined and subjected to lectures by eminent professors. My idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate titans, oil barons, money managers, lawyers, high-tech consultants and old-money heirs had gone to Harvard. A disproportionate tally might suggest that the university eased its standards for the offspring of wealthy backers. I began working through the list, poring over Whoâ€™s Who in America and Harvard class reunion reports for family information. Charles and Seryl Kushner were both on the committee. I had never heard of them, but their joint presence struck me as a sign that Harvardâ€™s fundraising machine held the couple in especially fond regard. The clips showed that Charles Kushnerâ€™s empire encompassed 25,000 New Jersey apartments, along with extensive office, industrial and retail space and undeveloped land. Unlike most of his fellow committee members, though, Kushner was not a Harvard man. He had graduated from New York University. This eliminated the sentimental tug of the alma mater as a reason for him to give to Harvard, leaving another likely explanation: his children. Sure enough, his sons Jared and Joshua had both enrolled there. Charles Kushner differed from his peers on the committee in another way: he had a criminal record. Five years after Jared entered Harvard, the elder Kushner pleaded guilty in 2004 to tax violations, illegal campaign donations and retaliating against a witness. (As it happens, the prosecutor in the case was Chris Christie, recently ousted as the head of Trumpâ€™s transition team.) Charles Kushner had hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal authorities. Kushner then had a videotape of the tryst sent to his sister. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison.   Related: Jewish employee of Trump's son-in-law writes open letter over antisemitism row   I completed my analysis, which justified my hunch. Of the 400-plus tycoons on Harvardâ€™s list â€“ which included people who were childless or too young to have college-age offspring â€“ more than half had sent at least one child to the university. I also decided that the Kushner-Harvard relationship deserved special attention. Although the university often heralded big gifts in press releases or a bulletin called, in a classic example of fundraising wit, Re:sources, a search of these outlets came up empty. Harvard didnâ€™t seem eager to be publicly associated with Charles Kushner. While looking into Kushnerâ€™s taxes, though, federal authorities had subpoenaed records of his charitable giving. I learned that in 1998, when Jared was attending the Frisch school and starting to look at colleges, his father had pledged $2.5m to Harvard, to be paid in annual instalments of $250,000. Charles Kushner also visited Neil Rudenstine, then Harvard president, and discussed funding a scholarship programme for low- and middle-income students. I phoned a Harvard official, with whom I was on friendly terms. First I asked whether the gift played any role in Jaredâ€™s admission. â€œYou know we donâ€™t comment on individual applicants,â€™â€™ he said. When I pressed further, he hung up. We havenâ€™t spoken since. At Harvard, Jared Kushner majored in government. Now the 35-year-old is poised to become the power behind the presidency. What he plans to do, and in what direction he and his father-in-law will lead the country, are far more important than his high school grades.",1
"According to an extremely wary congressional report issued Monday, the nation does not need and is not at all ready for this right now, though it might possibly be worth considering at some point in the future. The report goes on to state that 10 or 12 years from now would be the earliest anything could be done about this, but even that is probably a stretch. 'Now is simply not the time,' said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), who heads the joint subcommittee that commissioned the report. 'Setting aside the countless practical obstacles and prohibitive expense, we just don't know enough about this to justify moving forward at the present time.' Many policy experts have maintained that between slow economic recovery, the climate crisis, childhood obesity levels, and two ongoing wars, thisno matter how beneficial it might be in the long-termshould be entirely out of the question for now. It is also widely agreed that this will likely have to take a backseat to more pressing issues that we can actually wrap our heads around and try to do something about. 'Even if we could afford it right nowwhich we can't, by the wayit's totally untenable in a nation as polarized as ours,' said Dr. Travis Shapiro, a professor at Georgetown University. 'Suppose, hypothetically, that we could convince half the American people that this is something worth at least taking a look at. Then maybe maybewe could get the ball rolling on this in the next five years. But realistically, that's just not going to happen.' Some officials say the media has already done too much to sensationalize this. 'Not with the banking and auto industries in the states they're in,' he added. Leaders in nearly every field, including economics, entertainment, pharmacology, philosophy, macrobiotic nutrition, Jungian psychology, finance, robotics, oncology, and animal husbandry concurred with the report, saying that the worst course of action would be to enter into this too hastily without being fully prepared. A Rasmussen poll conducted last week found that 53 percent of Americans are not optimistic about this being an option in the foreseeable future, 13 percent believe it's likely the nation will never be ready for it, and 27 percent are still trying to figure out what led up to this, never mind talking about a time frame for it. The remaining 7 percent of respondents refused to answer any questions about it altogether. 'To be totally honest, I want this as much as any other reasonable person,' Cleveland-area contractor Henry Dickson said. 'But you have to face facts: No one's really ready for this yetnot the military, not African-Americans, not big business, and certainly not teen mothers.' However, a small but vocal minority has come out in favor of getting this under way as soon as possible. 'As the wealthiest, most powerful nation on the planet, we should be taking the lead on this,' said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL). 'Our projections show the Chinese may be ready for it in as few as three years. If we, as Americans, don't take responsibility and change our attitude, we're going to get caught with our pants down.' 'We can't afford to get left behind on this,' Durbin added. 'The stakes are too damn high.' But Eric Riordan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, believes that policy makers have gotten way ahead of themselves by even talking about it. 'I can't believe people are already considering the cost and logistics, as if we're anywhere close to that stage yet,' Riordan said. 'Frankly, it's irresponsible to be discussing this when you consider the fact that our real problem is already here, staring us in the face, as we speak, and it's not going away anytime soon.' At press time, the White House released a statement indicating the president would approach this with extreme caution, knowing full well the historical examples of the Persians, the Romans, and the British, all of whom got into this carelessly and paid dearly for it.

"NEWARK â€” New Jersey Transit reached a tentative agreement with its rail workers on Friday night to avoid a strike that could have paralyzed commuting into New York City, officials said.The deal came just over a day before workers could have started the strike. Officials with the transportation agency had warned that a shutdown would have sent tens of thousands of rail passengers onto buses and roads, causing major traffic congestion and delays in the region.â€œThankfully for the commuters of New Jersey Transit, the crisis is averted,â€ Stephen Burkert, a spokesman for the union coalition, told reporters at a news conference after a long day of talks at a hotel here.After months of tense negotiations, the union leaders declined to discuss the specifics of the deal, which averted a strike that could have begun on Sunday. The unionsâ€™ workers still must ratify the agreement.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, said he was pleased with the deal. He said the labor contract would last through the end of 2019, giving workers and commuters some stability.Mr. Christie said that the agreement would not prompt a fare increase â€” something the agency had warned was a possibility â€” but that modest fare increases were likely to happen periodically in the future. He said that he was confident the workers would ratify the agreement, and that he had agreed not to provide further details about the deal until the unions discussed it with their members.â€œThis agreement has come after long and hard negotiations and compromises on both sides,â€ the governor said at a news conference at New Jersey Transitâ€™s headquarters here.As commuters became increasingly worried about a strike over the past week, both sides said they wanted to avoid one. But New Jersey Transit had announced contingency plans, warning it could accommodate fewer than half of the 105,000 people who take trains into New York City each weekday.The agencyâ€™s more than 4,200 rail workers had been working without a new contract since 2011. The unions argued that they should receive wage rates and benefits comparable to those of other transit workers in the region, including employees of the Long Island Rail Road, where a strike was narrowly averted in 2014.New Jersey Transit officials had said they could not afford to meet the unionsâ€™ demands and might have to raise fares. Nearly half of the agencyâ€™s annual budget comes from fares, and it also relies on federal and state subsidies. Transit advocates have called on elected officials to increase funding for the agency and to establish a dedicated revenue source.The unions had pushed for wage increases of about 17 percent over six and a half years, with workers contributing up to 2.5 percent of their pay toward health coverage. Agency officials had proposed a 10.4 percent wage increase over seven and a half years and employee health care contributions of between 10 percent and 20 percent of the cost of premiums.As talks continued last week, Mr. Christie called some of the unionsâ€™ demands â€œoutrageous.â€ But on Friday night, he was conciliatory, calling the deal a fair and reasonable agreement.Mr. Christie said that he was never too concerned a strike would be called and that negotiations often came down to the last minute.â€œPeople generally donâ€™t settle until they have to,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re about 30 hours or so from â€˜have to.â€™ So we got it done.â€",1

"A dozen of the countryâ€™s jails now have such chronic staff shortages they are having to draft in officers from other prisons to help maintain order. The staff shortage has forced some jails into locking prisoners in their cells for extended periods, especially at weekends. Anger at the time they were spending in their cells was cited as a major factor behind last weekendâ€™s riot at Bedford prison. The shortages are also a significant factor in the rise in prison suicides, according to experts. On Saturday it was confirmed that 99 people have taken their lives this year in prisons in England and Wales. â€œThis year has seen the highest number of self-inflicted deaths in prison on record,â€ said Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, the charity that monitors deaths in custody. â€œThis unacceptable death toll reflects the desperate reality of overcrowded, dehumanising and violent prison conditions and the failure of prisons to protect those in their care.â€ The Prison Officersâ€™ Association (POA) said that the National Offender Management Service, which oversees the countryâ€™s prisons, has classed 12 jails as â€œred sitesâ€, meaning they do not have enough staff to operate a standard regime. A similar number are classed as â€œamber sitesâ€, indicating they are also suffering acute staffing issues. The POA told the Observer it estimated around 35% of the countryâ€™s prisons were experiencing some form of staffing problem. HMP Isis in south-east London had to introduce a restricted emergency regime in response to staff shortages three years ago. The prisons inspectorate called for the temporary arrangement to be scrapped in 2014. But a report by the inspectorate last month noted that it was still in place. â€œBetween 34% and 44% of prisoners were locked in their cells during the working day and some prisoners had as little as one hour a day out of cell. The two house blocks shared access to work and education facilities, meaning that at any one time only up to half of the young prisoners were doing anything useful â€¦ Another area of significant concern was the safety of prisoners.â€ Concerns about safety in the countryâ€™s prisons are mounting. Last month specialist officers had to be brought in after prisoners â€œwent on the rampageâ€ at Lewes prison in Sussex, another red site. A â€œmini-riotâ€ at HMP Exeter earlier this month saw a member of staff held hostage. In August, disturbances were reported at Birmingham jail. The following month an officer at Lincoln was reportedly taken hostage and beaten after a riot broke out. Pentonville in London, from which two prisoners escaped last week, has also been plagued by problems. Last month, a prisoner died after being stabbed at the jail. The POA told the Observer that since then there had been a further six attacks â€“ all carried out with weapons made from razor blades â€“ on the same wing.   Related: As a prison doctor Iâ€™ve seen the crisis in jails â€“ half the inmates shouldnâ€™t be there | Gordon Cameron   Dave Todd, national representative with the POA, said a common picture was emerging. He said: â€œThere arenâ€™t any staff to give prisoners any meaningful regimes, so when they get out [of their cells] they want to stay out. They may get out for an hour per day at weekends but then theyâ€™re back in their cells. Youâ€™ve got a lot of prisons that are classed as red sites â€“ certain prisons that have got real issues havenâ€™t got enough staff in post to deliver [a] full regime. A lot of the time theyâ€™re getting surplus staff from other jails, but even that is not enough.â€ Todd warned staff were becoming burned out. More prison officers are now leaving the service than are being recruited as morale plummets. Figures just published by the Ministry of Justice show that in the past year the number of full-time prison officers has dropped by almost 600. â€œLiz Truss [the justice secretary] has promised 2,500 new officers, but thatâ€™s probably what theyâ€™ve taken out in the last three years â€“ itâ€™s made all prisons unsafe,â€ Todd said. â€œIn some prisons you are starting on Â£19,000 a year. No offence to Tesco, but youâ€™d probably get a better wage working in its stores than some prisons.â€ He described an increasingly violent culture within the countryâ€™s jails. â€œMany have gang issues. Prisoners end up in debt after using new psychoactive substances such as spice. If they donâ€™t pay for it, the dealers will take retribution and usually thatâ€™s in physical harm. Weâ€™ve got drones dropping drugs off. Weâ€™ve got old Victorian prisons where you can get access to the prison wall from a public footpath and throw things over.â€ But the source of all the problems was fundamentally a lack of staff, he suggested. â€œWe havenâ€™t got enough to effect a decent searching strategy. We used to search a cell once every month, but we donâ€™t do that any more. Itâ€™s all intelligence-led now. Itâ€™s reaction rather than proaction. If you look up and down the country, where thereâ€™s a lack of staff then thereâ€™s a lack of regime and then there is violence and self-harm.â€ Official figures show that there are 65 assaults a day in the countryâ€™s jails and an average of two suicides a week. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: â€œPrisons across the country are struggling to deal with a toxic mix of problems â€“ a growing population, chronic overcrowding and deep cuts to staffing. Without enough staff to keep people safe, prisons are increasingly providing restricted regimes, under which prisoners are locked in their cells for up to 23 hours a day.   Related: Liz Trussâ€™s Â£9-per-hour prison officers wonâ€™t produce safe, humane prisons | John Podmore   â€œLockdowns mean that men who could be in education or training, learning skills to help them lead crime-free lives on release, are spending their sentences lying on their bunks. Worse, the restrictions can spark violence, self-injury and disturbances, such as the riot in Bedford prison.â€ The Prison Service said: â€œWe have announced a major shake-up of the prison system, with 2,500 extra prison officers and new security measures to tackle drones, phones and drugs and help make prisons places of safety and reform. The justice secretary has always been clear that it will take time to address these longstanding problems and we must grip the real challenges and risks that we face in the shorter term.â€ John Attard, national officer with the Prison Governorsâ€™ Association, said the closure of 13 prisons under the current government had exacerbated overcrowding pressures. â€œFor the last two years, the PGA have been saying that references to drones, phones and spice were to some degree a convenient excuse that drew attention away from the issues of staffing. The bottom line is many prisons have not got enough officers.â€",1
"NBCs Meet the Press hits lowest rating in 21 yearsJon Rappoport The big-3 Sunday morning news shows are basically politicians talking through the screen to their colleagues in Georgetown. Gibberish from idiots to other idiots. In so far as the shows reach the general viewing public The unspoken premise of This Week, Meet the Press, and Face the Nation goes like this: Given the fact that America is making constant war to expand the imperial corporate empire, the military industrial complex is suffering a hernia from carrying so much money, multiple agencies are spying on everybody all the time, the medical system in America is killing 2.25 million people per decade, millions of acres of untested GMO food plus Roundup are a runaway health disaster, the Fed Reserve is a private banking monopoly posing as a government agency, the Mexican border is a sieve for the Sinaloa Cartel to kick off their Washington-approved drug routes to a distribution hub called Chicago, only the cops and thugs should have guns, the government-sponsored mental-health monopoly called psychiatry is destroying the brains of countless numbers of children, vaccines are filled with toxic ingredients, the federal government is pouring wet cement on the Constitution every hour of every day, more people are using food stamps than are working, our children are learning how to become little robots in school, the free and independent individual is an anathema, television is brainwashing 300 million people, and all presidents are vetted to ensure theyll support a Globalist planetNONE OF WHICH WELL TOUCH ON IN THE NEXT HOUR WHATS NEW THIS WEEK? Well, David, gurgle, gurgle, ahem, and then we have, but of course, some people believe, although I would say Riveting. The challenge for David Gregory, George Stephanopoulos (This Week), and Bob Schieffer (Face the Nation) is: how do I make the interviews and conversations sound real, when more and more viewers realize were just doing another trance-induction? The basis of hypnotic trance is: no authentic context. Thats it. The victim narrows his focus, under the direction of the hypnotist, producing a free-floating state devoid of any significant external connections. David Gregorys ratings-dive to third place, among the Sunday puppet shows, is mainly the effect of him failing to affect a persona that enhances the basic hypnotic effect of the non-news. Hes just a bland gray egg. He doesnt produce the sing-song mesmerizing rhythms of Bob Schieffer, who learned that trick as an anchor. Stephanopoulos, the boy wonder from the Clinton years, works an earnest front for the This Week audience, pretending hes really searching for answers to weighty questions. Gregory is basically a poor actor. Hes clueless about how to present clueless news. And he replaced the popular Tim Russert, who made his reputation by liking every disingenuous moron he ever interviewed. The Sunday morning news-talk shows were invented to transmit the impression the networks were doing public service by exploring political issues in greater depth. They became prestige items for corporate advertisers. The Sunday shows also evolved, over the years, to present the entirely phony idea that, on all major subjects of interest, the two political parties in America hold widely diverging views. Media companies, of course, specialize in that nonsense. The public must never learn there is basically one political party in the US. Absent any prurient scandal, mass shooting, or disaster, these shows hobble along until election season, when they really swing into gear and feature The Horse Race. At that point, they vibrate between giving free ad time to candidates and asking deep thinkers to assess how the competing election PR teams are doing in their efforts to rope in voters. In general, the Sunday morning viewing audience is supposed to feel theyre peering through a window to obtain insiders views on topics of great import. David Gregory is dying on camera. Perhaps Mr. Wackadoodle, Chris Matthews, will ascend to the Meet the Press throne. However, in the endless op to persuade Americans that the two-party system encompasses the whole spectrum of political thought, the Sunday shows have already been upstaged by more asinine and, therefore, popular installments: MSNBC and FOX. There you can find bigger hacks and hustlers shoveling 24/7 manure. They dont bother with the niceties. They just pile it on by the ton. There, also, the proof of the pudding is in the eating during election season. If there is any lingering hope that newspeople believe the Constitution holds a shred of validity, those networks dispel it when they start wall to wall campaigning for the latest presidential crime figures. About-Face on the Nation, This Weak, and Meat the Press dont stand a chance. Theyre relics of a time when lies were supposed to be delivered politely. The three major networks should bury those corpses and use the time to re-air the most outrageous partisan political moments of the week, from FOX, MSNBC, and CNN. A special segment, called Operation Mockingbird, would feature a CIA spokesman delivering the best lie we planted as a news story in the past seven days. A final feature, played for comic value, The NSA Spies on an Entirely Innocent Private Citizen, would highlight the blow-by-blow tracking of an American at work and at home. And then its on to golf, infomercials for vacation paradises and juicers, and Mail Your Money to This Particular TV Preacher Before Its Too Late. Not to worry. Im developing an exciting Sunday show called The Food Stamp President. Well take cameras into the homes and cardboard boxes of formerly employed Americans who are learning a valuable lesson: Dependence means never having to say youre sorry. Were negotiating with a primary sponsor. Planned Parenthood. They have deep pockets, via your generous tax contributions to the federal government. The overriding message? The gov will always and forever save you, but you should abort all those extra family members before they come into this world. Itll give you a stress-free existence. Other sponsors? Cell-phone companies. Talk is cheap, and well prove it. Sign up for your gratis phone. The White House loves you.

"Common Core education: the insane bottom lineJon Rappoport For the sake of my argument here, Im putting aside the fact that public education belongs under the purview of the states and not the federal government. This article is about how the federal government decided Common Core would succeed. Im not going to recite brain-numbing examples of teaching basic math to very young children, under the Common Core system. Suffice it to say, I can add 9 and 6 and come up with the right answer. And I know why 9 and 6 equals 15. I dont need Boolean algebra or set theory or a base-10 system to understand why addition works. The bottom line on Common Core was articulated by Diane Ravitch in her 2013 book, Reign of Error. Ravitch writes: these new [Common Core] standards had never been field-tested anywhere. No one can say with certainty whether the Common Core standards will improve education, whether they will reduce or increase achievement gaps among different groups, or how much it will cost to implement them. Some scholars believe they [Common Core standards] will make no difference, and some critics say they will cost billions to implement; others say they will lead to more testing. In short, whatever else Common Core is, it is an experimental hypothesis. It has never been field-tested. No one knew how well it would work when it was proposed, implemented, and accepted. No one knows now. Butno problem. Lets try it out on millions of American school childrenand lets pretend were sure, in advance, that it will be a success. This is like saying, Better dentistry can be achieved by pulling 14 teeth from every teenager. Lets implement and fund this program at the federal level and bribe dentists by assuring them theyll be reimbursed for their efforts. This is the new health-plan for teeth in America. We dont need to do studies. We dont need to do clinical trials. Because we desire better dentistry, we know well get it. Our intentions are all the proof we need. The extreme irrationality of this approach to education should be taught, in schools, as a prime example of non-logic and non-application of the scientific method. I would teach it in the eighth grade. Im quite sure students would catch on right away: You mean this is how the government decided our new education would be a good thing? With no proof? Just some weird claims? Wow. How can I get out of the system? A group of abstract thinkers got together and decided they knew, from the top of their mountain view, that Common Core would succeed. Well, thats part of what abstract means, when youre talking about mass programming. No reason to test a hypothesis. Common Core is a self-evident truth. How nice. For them. Nice work if you can get it. Your job is to come up with an education plan that will replace the old plan. Explain it and float it on the basis that uniform and across-the-board standards are always better than patchwork standards. People respond positively to the term uniform. Talk about failures of the old plan. Youll be fine. Sound authoritative. That, in a nutshell, is Common Core. Well, when you have thousands of police forces in towns and cities across the land, the result is a wide variance in enforcement methods. Thats unacceptable. We need one national police force operating according to one standard plan. Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly), many people like that idea. They automatically assume one top-down force is better than many smaller forces. They believe top-down equals fair. How quaint. How delightful. How trusting. Lets move along to the next phase of Common Core: deciding in 10 or 20 years how well its working. I cant wait for that. On what basis will the federal assessment be written? If its written at all? College readiness of the student seems to be the official acid test for how well Common Core works. Which college? Podunk Junior Community College, where every applicant who can breathe on a mirror and produce fog is accepted? Harvard? Some state college that exists on federal money is going to say, Common Core is an abject failure and the federal idiots who put it together should be given prison terms? With Common Core, we have an experimental hypothesis that was never tested in the field; and later on, we will have an assessment of its success based on standards loose enough to allow any conclusion under the sunespecially a conclusion that supports the program, which by that time will be too big to fail. Perfect. Finally, judging from the overwrought abstract methods of math instruction for very young Common Core students, I predict the following: Basic strategies of mind control will have an exceptionally deleterious effect on those children. The basic strategies involve a) a captive audience, b) compulsory learning, c) purposely making simple factors quite complex, and thereby d) inducing a state of confusion on both an intellectual and emotional level. Thus manufacturing extreme cognitive dissonance. The experimental subjects (children) will become highly resentful, quiescent, desperate. Ideal candidates for psychiatric diagnoses and drugging with toxic compounds. In fact, the failure of Common Core will be laid at the door of the rising tide of mental illness in America. Underneath it all, these grown children will be walking powder kegs. They will bring chaos in ways people are afraid to imagine. If you think Im exaggerating, I can only say I was once a schoolteacher, and I had a number of those students in my classrooms. Theyd been subjected to earlier, less powerful forms of cognitive dissonance, and they were a mess, to put it mildly. A few of them were on their way to becoming career criminals. Common Core is a much heavier version of cognitive dissonance, and its effects will reverberate at deeper emotional levels. I say, if you possibly can, bring your children home and school them there. Awaken their bright minds. Show them they are competent. Teach them logic. Encourage their natural curiosity and their creative power. Foster their independence. Then they will be able to deal with the world and its contradictions and dissonances from a position of strengthinstead of struggling as its victims. Dont permit them to become Common Cores test guinea pigs. In one of the first interviews I did with retired propaganda operative Ellis Medavoy (pseudonym), in 1999, he told me: You need to understand that propaganda has a number of objectives. Its not always about planting false ideas in peoples minds. Sometimes its about giving them contradictory data, or data that will set up a confusion and leave them hanging, unable to figure out what the storyline is. They expect something rational, and you give them something that makes no sense. You leave them in a swamp. You do that enough times and people will experience actual pain. And theyll feel stupid. I then asked Medavoy if this approach could be applied to education in schools Of course, he said. Remember something called the New Math? It was introduced into schools in the 1960s. It was based on a branch of logic called set theory. Simple arithmetic was translated into that complex garble. An easy problem or arithmetical calculation suddenly became bizarre and often incomprehensible. Boiling water suddenly became a seventeen-step process for PhD candidatesonly you were dealing with seven-year olds. The New Math was a trap for young minds. A maze. Once youre in it, you cant get out. You dont know where youre going. Every day, new confusions are added to old confusions. Right out there in the open, this was a program of brainwashing. The goal wasnt planting falsehoods. Under the guise of teaching logic and critical thinking, the goal was mass confusion. Young minds want answers. If you keep denying them those answers, you induce chaos. You pour chaos into what would otherwise be a straightforward process. You demean thinking. You make children believe thinking has no purpose. Do you see? Do your see what that achieves? Schools become factories for insanity. Most people just dont get this. They dont see that inducing confusion is a tactic, a weapon. Its powerful. There should be a whole branch of college learning called Confusion Studies. How its done. How its manufactured. How its used. You could revolutionize higher learning with that. You could clear away tons of garbage. You could wake people up to what has been done to them. You could eventually change society for the better. Thats why colleges dont teach students this subject. Too many of their courses are run by professors who make their living through delivering sophistry. Im here to tell you that some of this is quite, quite intentional. It isnt just business as usual. Its a psychological operation.

And too many of them succeed because of cooperation due to public schooling. Brilliant. 9 plus 6 wouldnt equal 15 in anything but a base-10 system. You are wrong about Common Core math not being field tested. This math program has been taken from a previous math curriculum put into use in the US school system in the early sixties called New Math. New Math was considered a failure and the comprehensive math scores of students in this program fell dramatically and it was quickly shelved after three or four years. Here is a link. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math However, this overview in the link is quite complex and is over burdened with mathematical terminology with no real indication of exactly what was meant or done.. I know about this because I was a student in the sixties and I learned math with the methods that are now being described as the common core method. People with access to what New Math texts and worksheets really looked like need to pull this stuff out and compare it as I think they will find Common Core is a giant plagiarism of these failed methods. Some hack thought no one would notice. Since the people that wanted a new method didnt care how good it was, why not just swipe something forgotten. I noticed because I had to make a concerted effort to untangle myself from these poor methods. At the time of the huge new math debacle there was much discussion. Excerpt from link In 1965, cartoonist Charles Schulz authored a series of Peanuts strips which detailed kindergartner Sallys frustrations with New Math. In the first strip, she is depicted puzzling over sets, one to one matching, equivalent sets, non-equivalent sets, sets of one, sets of two, renaming two, subsets, joining sets, number sentences, placeholders. Eventually she bursts into tears and exclaims, All I want to know is, how much is two and two? ",0
"What It Means to Be An NSA TargetNew Information Shows Why We Need Immediate FISA Amendments Act Reform An important New York Times investigation from today reporting that the NSA is searching the contents of vast amounts of Americans e-mail and text communications into and out of the country, coupled with leaked documents published by the Guardian, seriously calls into question the accuracy of crucial statements made by government officials about NSA surveillance. The government has previously tried to reassure the public about its use of FISA Amendments Act Section 702 surveillance practices, emphasizing that, under Section 702, the government may not intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States. Indeed, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Senator Feinstein, in a letter to constituents who wrote to her expressing concern about the NSAs spying program,said this: [T]he government cannot listen to an Americans telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause. Weve written before about the word games the government plays in describing its surveillance practices: acquire, collect, and content are all old government favorites. The New York Times report proves Feinstein statement is false, and its clear its time to add target to the list of word games as well. When Target Means Searching a Specific Persons Communications First, at least this much is clear: a target under the FAA must be (a) a non-US person and (b) not physically located within the United States. A person, for purposes of the FAA, includes individuals as well as any group, entity, association, corporation, or foreign power. Under the FAA, the government can thus target a single individual (e.g., Vladimir Putin), a small group of people (e.g., Pussy Riot), or a formal corporation or entity (e.g., Gazprom). When Target Means Searching Everyones Communications Once a target is established, the NSA believes it can expand the sweep of its interception far more broadly than the communications of the particular, identified target. Notably, the NSAsprocedures state (emphasis added): [I]n those cases where NSA seeks to acquire communications about the target that are not to or from the target, NSA will either employ an Internet Protocol filter to ensure that the person from whom it seeks to obtain foreign intelligence information is located overseas, or it will target Internet links that terminate in a foreign country. In plain English: the NSA believes it not only can (1) intercept the communications of the target, but also (2) intercept communications about a target, even if the target isnt a party to the communication. The most likely way to assess if a communication is about a target is to conduct a content analysis of communications, probably based on specific search terms or selectors. And that, folks, is what we call a content dragnet. Importantly, under the NSAs rules, when the agency intercepts communications about a target, the author or speaker of those communications does not, thereby, become a target: the target remains the original, non-US person. But, because the target remains a non-US person, the most robust protection for Americans communications under the FISA Amendments Act (and, indeed, the primary reassurance the government has given about the surveillance) flies out the window. If you communicate about a target of NSA surveillance, your citizenship is irrelevant: the only thing standing between you and NSA surveillance is your IP address or the fiber optic path through which your communications flow. Privacy Protections Must Be Stronger than an IP Address or the Path our Communications Happen to Take The NSA only limits this type of broad content dragnet in two ways: a filter based on IP addresses or directing its surveillance at Internet links that terminate in a foreign country.1 Presumably, the IP filter is used in circumstances where the NSAs surveillance is being conducted on U.S. soil. The agency simply filters out known U.S. IP addresses and scans the content of the rest. But there are a host of reasons that an Americans IP address might not be representative of their location. First, there are a variety of privacy-enhancing technologies like Tor or VPNs that could easily make wholly domestic communications appear as though they were occurring overseas. Second, IP addresses, in general, are imperfect measures of a persons location: if a large ISP (like, for example, ATT) is assigned a block of IP addresses, an IP address assigned to someone in Canada one day could be assigned to an American the next, and vice versa. And all this, of course, says nothing about nationality or legal status: a given IP address says nothing about the citizenship of the person using the device. The only other limitation on this type of content dragnet is targeting Internet links in foreign countries. Again, like IP filtering, this is not an effective way to ensure that Americans communications are not intercepted and analyzed. In particular, because third-party providers (like Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft) tend to have redundant and distributed operations around the world, theres a very real chance that your wholly domestic email, sent between two U.S. citizens might travel and be stored on data centers around the world. Targeting an Internet link that terminates abroad would inevitably carry large amounts of purely domestic communications. An Example: Targeting Vladimir Putin (and Everyone Else) At this point, it might be useful to provide an example. Say the NSA wants to target Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, under Section 702. Putin is (a) a non-US-person, (b) (usually) located outside the United States, and (c) would clearly be expected to communicate foreign intelligence information. He is thus eligible for targeting under Section 702. The NSA would then intercept Putins calls, emails, chats, and other communications (including those directed at the United States and involving United States citizens). Under the NSAs rules, though, the agency can also intercept all communications about Putin. To accomplish this, NSA presumably performs a content analysis probably occurring both within the United States and overseas of large swaths of communications, using deep packet inspection to root out electronic communications about Putin. In this example, under the NSAs procedures, a U.S. citizen sending an email about Putinsfrequent, shirtless poses to another U.S. citizen could have their communications intercepted and analyzed by NSA under a variety of conditions: In each of these examples, the NSA believes it has the authority to intercept your communications, even though in most examples the person doing the communicating is (1) a US person, (2) located within the United States, (3) communicating with someone within the United States, and (4) not communicating with the target of an investigation. While the NSA may not intercept every email about Putins shirtless poses, based on its procedures, it believes it has the authority. Such an interpretation of the governments authority under the FAA violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. Not to mention the Constitution. After a Full and Public Investigation, We Need to Rein in the NSAs Use of Section 702 Lately, the focus of the NSA debate has shifted to the NSAs domestic associational tracking program the collection and storage of millions of Americans call record information. And rightly so: the program is unconstitutional, and EFF has filed suit to stop it immediately. But Section 702 should not be forgotten: it needs attention and reform as well. As the debate continues, when Diane Feinstein tells you that the government cannot listen to an Americans telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause, shes not telling you the truth: the government can read your emails without ever even asking a judge and without even attempting to demonstrate that probable cause exists, just so long as your emails have a foreign IP address or your communications happen to leave the country. Our constitutional right to communicate without our government listening in has been fundamentally reinterpreted and diminished in secret: the NSAs procedures show that all that stands between government surveillance of our communication is an IP address. But the constitution demands more. Join us, and over 500,000 others, in calling on Congress to establish a special committee to investigate the NSAs domestic spying operation, to rein in the laws the government uses to conduct this type of spying, and to hold elected officials accountable for misleading the American public. 1.The NSAs use of the term internet links is not clear, and the procedures dont spell out precisely what they mean. We assume internet link to mean telecom switches and hubs located overseas. linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0
"Bibi Netanyahu Was Threatened To Not Speak About His Faith, So He Does THIS Instead According to recent reports, House Democrats are threatening to boycott Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech about the United States negotiations with Iran, and his faith. If Democrats follow through with their threat, they would be directly insulting our closest ally in the Middle East. And of course, they would be ignoring those American people who may have an interest in what the leader has to say about politics and religion. With how things are going, why not hear an alternate opinion about these two subjects? It is clear that the Administration would rather follow Obama blindly into his web of lies than listen to what other world leaders have to say. What do you think of the threat? Is it time we stood up for our allies? ",0
"Danica Patrick is racing in Florida this weekend, but not with the good ol' boys of the NASCAR Nationwide series. Interested? If the answer is a resounding yes, I'm guessing you already have plans to attend the Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, a full IndyCar weekend with the main event scheduled Sunday afternoon on a flashy waterfront street course not far from Tropicana Field. If not, consider it evidence of a fairly obvious Danica disconnect. She still wants to win the Indy 500 more than anything else, but the unchanging truth is that America has a bigger, longer-lasting crush on NASCAR. She's bright enough to get that, and when Patrick returns to stock cars in late June, she'll get the spotlight back, too. The St. Pete race is on ABC, and that's so much better than the Indy Racing League's season opener at Sao Paulo on March 14. Stuck with limited audience potential on the Versus network, that race drew about 411,000 viewers. Not bad, but Patrick's stock-car debut in a February ARCA support race at Daytona International Speedway grabbed 2.4 million viewers on the Speed network. What's more, the NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers took the weekend of the Sao Paulo race off, providing a perfect window of opportunity for the open-wheelers to clean up with race fans. They didn't. There's just no comparison. Patrick finished 15th with a rainy spinout at Sao Paulo and earned no big headlines in the U.S. for her efforts. She wasn't even the first female driver across the finish line. Rookie Ana Beatriz Figueiredo, one of four women in the field, got there before Patrick. On the other hand, Patrick received obsessive television coverage for her Nationwide finishes -- 35th place at Daytona, 31st at California and 36th at Las Vegas. When she left the track with a crumpled car at Daytona, there were more reporters shoving and pushing for a quote at her garage than there were to meet the race winner, whoever the heck that was. All right, all right, I know that Tony Stewart won the Drive4COPD 300 that afternoon. Just making a point. Even with the swimsuit magazine shoots and the racy GoDaddy television commercials and a gigantic, new billboard on the side of a Times Square skyscraper, Patrick needs to sign up for something much closer to a full NASCAR schedule next year, with her Indy career playing out more like a part-time gig. It's a relationship that can't help but work. Dave George writes for The Palm Beach Post. E-mail: dave(underscore)george@pbpost.com. ",1
"Sally Phillips and her husband, Andrew, didnâ€™t find out that their first child, Olly, 12, had Downâ€™s syndrome until he was 10 days old. Nobody noticed on the day he was born. â€œI had a caesarean because he was breech,â€ says Phillips. â€œI reacted badly to the anaesthetic so everyone was focused on me. Olly scored highly on all the tests and no one noticed there was anything different about him. I noticed. And I asked them to look at him. There was something about his eyes that was troubling me. ItÂ was as if his cheeks were really big and not allowing his eyes to open. I said, â€˜Does he look like that because I ate a lot of cake when I was pregnant?â€™ They said, â€˜Yes, probably.â€™â€ Best-known for her roles in the Bridget Jones films (as Bridgetâ€™s best friend, Shazza) and Miranda (where she plays Mirandaâ€™s old school friend, Tilly), she has a knack of making comedy out of life, including her own. And she is not afraid of making fun of herself or her family. Indeed, showing that you can have a normal family life (because what is that anyway?) with a child with Downâ€™s syndrome is one of the main points of a documentary Phillips has made for BBC2, A World Without Downâ€™s Syndrome? Her first documentary, it examines whether the new, non-invasive screening tests that are available will eventually eradicate Downâ€™s syndrome. Phillips finds the prospectÂ chilling. She didnâ€™t know that Olly would have Downâ€™s syndrome. â€œBabies with Downâ€™s syndrome quite often have poor muscle tone and find it hard to feed. We would stay up all night trying to feed him and by 10 days after his birth, he had gone down from 8lb to 3lb. Everyone was still saying, â€˜Youâ€™re a first-time mum and youâ€™re worrying. Babies always lose weight.â€™â€ She had all the usual prenatal tests but they all came out as indicating an average risk. She admits she felt strange during the pregnancy but put it down to being a first-time mother. â€œIâ€™m not one of these people who thinks they are psychic. But I just didnâ€™t feel good during the pregnancy. I was all swollen up. It was like Iâ€™d been stung by a giant hornet. But everyone kept saying, â€˜Youâ€™re a first-time mum, itâ€™s allÂ fine.â€™ Now, being politically correct, IÂ wouldnâ€™t say that I felt that something was â€˜wrongâ€™ but I knew that it was different.â€ Phillipsâ€™ instinct was right. But she is evidently resilient and resolved to be open-minded about parenting a child with Downâ€™s syndrome. She has been pleasantly surprised. â€œThere were lots of moments during Ollyâ€™s babyhood where I would think to myself, â€˜Wait a minute, I am not experiencing this as a disaster.â€™ But you are so bought into the narrative. All the pregnancy books refer to Downâ€™s syndrome as a â€˜defectâ€™. All you get is this information that says â€˜High incidence of leukaemia, high incidence of deafnessâ€™ â€¦ Itâ€™s totally overwhelming and unhelpful.â€ Her family life, as seen on the documentary, is the counter-narrative: water fights, paint fights, an obsession with Barcelona football club and a lot of dancing. Olly, it turned out, was completely different to the â€œtragedyâ€ she was reading about. â€œOlly smiled his first smile at four weeks, like any baby, and it was this massive great big smile. I remember I had this one moment when I was going into town on the bus and there were these two mums with their â€˜perfectâ€™ babies and they were complaining and whingeing about everything. I thought, oh. Iâ€™m supposed to be having a dreadful time? Iâ€™m really not.    Sally Phillips in a scene from the documentary, A World Without Downâ€™s Syndrome? Photograph: Brian J Ritchie   â€œAt that point I was swinging Olly around the house in a towel, trying to teach him to crawl. That is something you would not have to teach a â€˜normalâ€™ child. But we were learning to crawl together and our bond was incredibly strong. We would laugh like lunatics for large portions of the day.â€ We are talking in a large room overlooking the garden at her house in south-west London. Every two seconds we are interrupted by her two younger sons, Tom, four, and Luke, nine, showing off and being random. Their father, Andrew, a shipping industry executive, hovers nearby. She chases the boys out but they keep coming back. Eventually Olly wanders in with his iPad, looking for peace and quiet. â€œTurn the sound off if youâ€™re coming in here, Olly,â€ says Phillips. â€œIt is off,â€ he looks at us, witheringly, suddenly deciding against sharing space with two boring old people, â€œBut bye bye.â€ Itâ€™s standard 12-year-old behaviour. Olly attends a mainstream school and has disproved a lot of theories Phillips was told about when he was born. â€œI was told he would never ride a bike. He goes for a bike ride every day. I was told he would never be able to climb anything. Then we started having this problem where he would scale the back fence of the garden because he wanted to make friends with the neighbourâ€™s children. None of the rest of us could scale thatÂ fence.Â The thing is, nobody knowsÂ what Downâ€™s syndrome children can achieve.â€   Do we really want to eliminate this community of people â€“ 40,000 strong â€“ in the UK?   It took years for her to decide that she was willing to front a documentary about Downâ€™s syndrome. For a long time she had been hoping that someone else would make one and show the truth about how living with a child with Downâ€™s syndrome is not depressing and life-ruining â€“ in fact, the opposite. Eventually she realised that this wouldnâ€™t happen and she would have to make it herself. The tipping point? The new prenatal testing that should soon be available on the NHS â€“ NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing). This is a blood test that is done from week 10 of pregnancy and detects Downâ€™s syndrome with 99% accuracy. In countries such as Iceland (which Phillips visits in the film), the introduction of the test has meant that 100% of Downâ€™s syndrome pregnancies are terminated. Phillips wants to pose the question: Do we really want to eliminate this community of people â€“ 40,000 strong â€“ in the UK? â€œWe have the most expensive state-of-the-art Downâ€™s syndrome detection test and the ability to terminate right up until birth. But no allowance is made for the point of view of the other side. The families of people with Downâ€™s syndrome are not consulted. People with Downâ€™s syndrome are not consulted. There has never been an ethical debate about it.â€ Phillips didnâ€™t particularly want to be the one to start this debate, but thatâ€™s how it has worked out. Her status as an apologetic and reluctant activist is what makes the film appealing, funny and easy to watch. Although she has made no secret of the fact that she is a Christian and a lot of her fascination with ethics is clearly informed by her faith, she is keen to emphasise that she is pro-choice. Plus, she has a fierce curiosity about the views of those she disagrees with. The film shows her struggling with her emotions as she interviews a woman who decided to abort a Downâ€™s syndrome child. Phillips shows the woman a video of a Downâ€™s syndrome woman competing at a gymnastics competition. The woman is unmoved and unimpressed. As the mother of a Downâ€™s syndrome child, Phillips is clearly angry. But you can also see that she is empathetic, trying to understand. Sheâ€™s a good person to put across two sides of the story. There are, of course, two sides to her own story in this context: life before and after Downâ€™s syndrome. â€œI didnâ€™t know anything about Downâ€™s syndrome at all,â€ she says. â€œI didnâ€™t even know anyone with a disabled child. In fact, I donâ€™t think I knew anyone who was disabled.â€   Related: Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, itâ€™s my son! Coming to terms with Downâ€™s Syndrome   Her point is that we are sleepwalking into a world where we could eliminate Downâ€™s syndrome. Is that what we really want? There is a question she has faced all her life as a parent that has always bothered her. â€œI get asked, â€˜Did you know?â€™ But what I hate is that I also get asked, â€˜Didnâ€™t you know?â€™â€ The implication being that if she had known, surely she would have terminated the pregnancy. â€œAnd thatâ€™s what worries me.â€ She would not have terminated the pregnancy. And with what she knows now, she wants to make more people aware of the fact that a Downâ€™s syndrome child does not need to be in the â€œdefectâ€ category. Quite the opposite, she would argue. She adds: â€œIn a system where everybody screens and where you know at 10 or 12 weeks with 99% certainty whether your unborn baby has Downâ€™s syndrome, it becomes â€˜your faultâ€™ if you choose to have the baby. We have imperceptibly flipped into a situation where the woman is under societal pressure to have that termination. Where does it lead? If you choose to have that child, should the government help you? After all, it was your choice. Why should anyone else help you? â€œWe are really close to that attitude already. There is already a new kind of pernicious discrimination towards disabled people, the idea that they are scroungers. â€˜Why should you steal my taxes?â€™ Who, then, would want to have that child?â€ â€¢ A World Without Downâ€™s Syndrome? willÂ be shown on BBC2 on 5 October",1
"SPIRIT LAKE, IAOn an ordinary day, amiable dim-bulb Jeff Koegle wanders into many places: his den, the bowling alley, maybe the local Spee-D-Kustard, which is only a three-block dawdle from his house. For as long as anyone in Spirit Lake can remember, this burly goof has schlepped along the road of life with neither purpose nor reason. Another day in the life of directionless oaf Jeff Koegle. 'I like to whistle sometimes when I'm going along,' Koegle said. 'Or maybe hum a tune that was on the radio last place I was.' Koegle added: 'Once, I heard a meow outside by the dumpster by Hardy's. It was a box of kitties. They let me keep one. I named him Yellow.' In his 34 years, Koegle has plodded his way through high school, two homes, an eight-year marriage, a series of mindless jobs, and the occasional boat show. The easily distracted boob has left no lasting legacy, save for an occasional knocked-over cup or upset magazine rack. 'I accidentally slapped a guy's soda out of his hand in line at the movies once,' Koegle said. 'Now he's a good friend.' Koegle's aimless blunderings occasionally trigger major developments in his life, which isn't saying much, because if it weren't for sheer happenstance, he would have no experiences at all. 'Once, when I was getting off the bus, I saw some little TVs in the window of a store,' said Koegle, his doughy mitts hanging limply at his sides. 'I went into the store, and I had a nice chat with a salesgal, and she asked me out on a date. Now that gal's my wife.' Longtime friends and associates say Koegle's oafish good cheer is as constant as his characteristic outfit: a sweatshirt, jeans, and a Salem windbreaker. 'Sometimes Jeff will come by, hang out for a bit,' said friend Dan Werner, who graduated from high school with Koegle in 1989. 'We'll maybe watch hockey or go get a bite to eat if one of us is hungry. After a while, he'll say, 'Well, guess I ought to get going,' and he'll take off.' Local merchant Evan Rasmussen Jr., proprietor of Rasmussen Dime & Drug, sold Koegle gum throughout the '90s. '[The lummox] wouldn't come in with any regularity, but once in a while he'd amble through,' Rasmussen said. 'When he'd grab the gum from the display, he'd muss up all the other packets of gum on the rack. I would always have to straighten them out after he left.' Eventually, Rasmussen asked Koegle to straighten the gum himself. Koegle has been working at Rasmussen Dime & Drug ever since. Koegle's wife Jeannette, 30, shared a more intimate view of the shambling clod. 'Yesterday during breakfast, I told Jeff to try taking charge of his life more, because I know he has it in him to make it happen,' Jeannette said. 'I could tell he was considering what I said, but then he seemed to forget all about it when the potato pancakes were served.' At home on his recliner, Koegle said he is 'just fine with' his directionless life. He added that he 'pretty much fell into it.' 'I guess I wouldn't mind working a few more hours at Rasmussen's here and there, but Jeannette and me are doing fine,' Koegle said. 'My cousin Jerry [Morris] wants us to move out to Wisconsin and work with him at the window-blind factory that's always hiring, and I think that might be nice, but to be honest, I don't give it a lot of serious thought.' Minutes after this confession, Koegle was fast asleep. At the close of another day, the stumblebum once again failed to conceive of a single quest, great or small. Yellow in his lap, he remained on the recliner through the night, his unconscious mind doubtlessly dancing with images of found sawbucks and crab apples. ",0
"Days before he was set to relocate to Denver for work, four-year Chicago resident Paul Marsden lamented Wednesday that he never really took the time to detest the city he called home for nearly half a decade. Its too bad, but I never got to truly despise Chicagos eight-month-long winters, or how the CTA takes forever and doesnt go anywhere you need it to, Marsden told reporters, regretting that he hadnt devoted any time to hating how nearly every bar in the city has several giant flatscreen TVs blaring Bulls, Bears, Cubs, White Sox, or Blackhawks games. Sure, I could go on and on about the noxious cloud of piss and stale vomit that hangs over Wrigleyville, or the faux edginess of Wicker Park, but there are so many other horrible neighborhoods I never got the chance to hate. I guess I always thought thered be time to appreciate how awful they are. Marsden then resolved that when he gets to Denver, hell start hating his new home as soon as he can. ",0
"One of Australiaâ€™s biggest superannuation lobby groups has criticised a new report calling for a radical rethink of super policy. David Whiteley, the chief executive of Industry Super Australia, said the report from the Grattan Institute, released earlier this week, contained numerous â€œstatistical sinsâ€ that rendered its conclusions misleading.   Related: Coalition and Labor 'largely agree' on superannuation changes, says thinktank   He said basic statistical errors â€“ such as averaging between rich and poor, young and old, employees and self-employed â€“ allowed the Grattan Institute to present a picture of household wealth that bore â€œlittle relationship to realityâ€. The instituteâ€™s claim that superannuation savings accounted for only a small portion â€“ about 15% â€“ of the wealth of most Australian households was simply not true, he said. And policymakers should not heed to the paperâ€™s recommendation to freeze the compulsory super rate at 9.5%. â€œThe Grattan Institute [has] made some very worthwhile contributions to public policy debates, but on this occasion [it has] made an error,â€ Whiteley said. â€œ[Its] analysis and conclusions are flawed and, if adopted, risk leaving the majority of the workforce, who donâ€™t have extensive property and share portfolios, without enough income to top up the basic age pension. â€œThe effect of [its] statistical sins inflate the apparent assets of low- and middle-income earners who we know have very little in the way of financial assets other than super and are especially reliant on the super guarantee to deliver income over and above the age pension.    â€œWithout super most Australians would be entering retirement with virtually no other savings.â€  The Grattan Instituteâ€™s paper, How Households Save for Retirement, was released on Sunday. John Daley, the instituteâ€™s chief executive, used the paper to call for a radical rethink of superannuation policy, saying super savings were not as significant for retirement as Australians had been led to believe. His analysis showed super was actually the least important part of Australiaâ€™s retirement income system, because the average Australian saved as much outside as inside the super system. This had huge implications for retirement income policy, and meant the compulsory super guarantee should not be lifted from 9.5% to 12%, as is legislated. â€œThere are powerful vested interests pushing the idea that super equals retirement savings,â€ Daley said. â€œYet such a view is inconsistent with the facts. Superâ€™s importance to retirement savings has been overblown for far too long.â€ When asked about Industry Superâ€™s criticism, Daley said it had missed the point of his report. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of people who have a lot of money outside of super, and therefore we should be doing the policy analysis taking that into account,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s the crux of our argument. â€œA lot of the analysis that is done to find out if people are saving enough for retirement is done precisely on the averages, in terms of peoplesâ€™ total super savings, and it blithely ignores the fact that thereâ€™s a whole bunch of people, employed and self-employed, who have a disproportionately large quantity of non-super savings.â€ Daley did not include owner-occupied housing in his analysis, despite Industry Superâ€™s claim.  He also said he split his analysis by age group, and by income, rather than averaging across age groups as Industry Super claimed.",1

"When Victor SÃ¡enz, an education professor at the University of Texas at Austin, began to focus his research nearly a decade ago on the plight of men in education, he experienced some pushback, even from fellow academics.â€œEarly on, Iâ€™d get a lot of questions,â€ said Mr. SÃ¡enz, who in 2010 started a mentoring group for male Hispanic students called Project Males â€” Mentoring to Achieve Latino Educational Success. â€œI wouldnâ€™t say criticisms, but certainly apprehension or resistance to focusing on this issue.â€But as degree attainment among men has continued to lag that of women, more state policy makers are looking at the issue in a bid to prevent the gap from significantly affecting the state.National interest is also rising. Last month, Mr. SÃ¡enz helped lead an online seminar hosted by the White House, which has started initiatives on the education of Hispanic and black men, the populations with the lowest rates of higher education success.â€œIf half the population is systematically lagging behind the other half, thatâ€™s going to be a real drag on our ability to meet our goals and secure any kind of prosperity for our future,â€ said Mr. SÃ¡enz, adding that the increased attention, particularly in a state with rapidly changing demographics, is probably driven by economic imperatives. (The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)David Gardner, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Boardâ€™s deputy commissioner for academic planning and policy, said he expected the issue to be a plank in the stateâ€™s next long-term higher education plan. Narrowing the gender gap was not an explicit goal in the stateâ€™s previous 15-year plan, which expires next year.When it comes to getting their degrees, female students outperform their male peers in every ethnic and socioeconomic group. But attainment is particularly low among Hispanic and black men.Of the Texas students who enrolled in eighth grade in 2001, about 23.3 percent of the female students had earned some sort of higher education credential, compared with 15.7 percent of the male students. Fewer than 10 percent of the black and Hispanic male students had earned a degree or certificate.A report released this year by the Austin-based Center for Community College Student Engagement said black male students reported the highest level of participation in educational and support programs at community colleges. But when compared with their white and Hispanic peers, they had the lowest success rates.Kay McClenney, the centerâ€™s former director, said this â€œconundrumâ€ might result, in part, from well-intentioned but ineffective support services.â€œWay too often,â€ she said, â€œthe programs are designed to fix the student rather than designed to fix the institution so that it is more effective at serving the student.â€Richard Rhodes, the president of Austin Community College, agreed. â€œAt times, not intentionally, we think weâ€™re doing the right thing, but we create barriers to opening up pathways for students.â€ (Richard Rhodes is a donor to The Tribune.)Austin Community College is a member of the Texas Education Consortium for Male Students of Color, which Mr. SÃ¡enz and his colleagues created last year. The group hopes to develop more effective strategies for boosting student achievement among minority men.â€œRight now, there are a lot of homegrown or boutique programs,â€ Mr. SÃ¡enz said. â€œBut there has not been a very good culture of evidence.â€",1
"Virginiaâ€™s Blue Ridge Mountains are country musicâ€™s Bowery: a landmark that everyone orbiting the genre â€“ from Dolly Parton to Fleet Foxes â€“ cites, regardless of whether theyâ€™ve been or not. On the other side of the world, however, perhaps it wonâ€™t be long until another blue-hued range is on the country map. Julia Jacklin hails from the Blue Mountains outside Sydney, and her debut, Donâ€™t Let The Kids Win, evokes a millennial Gillian Welch. Put the two together (plus some terrible national stereotypes) and you envisage the young Jacklin strumming on a porch, harmonising with the dingos. But Australia isnâ€™t in thrall to the Statesâ€™ singer-songwritery heritage. â€œIâ€™d say the [definitive] sound where I grew up was Australian hip-hop or soul music,â€ says Jacklin. â€œThereâ€™s not an indie-folk scene there.â€    And yet 26-year-old Jacklin is now part of a bold young Oceanic Americana cohort. After moving to Sydney to study, she went to record her debut in New Zealand, working with producer Ben Edwards because she loved his work on Auckland strummer Aldous Hardingâ€™s debut. There she met Port Chalmersâ€™ Nadia Reid, whose songs are full of haunted yearning, and Marlon Williams, whoâ€™s released volumes of country covers alongside his rousing original material.   Related: SXSW 2016: the insiders' guide on who to look out for this year   Back home, meanwhile, thereâ€™s Sydneyâ€™s Gene Clark acolyte Caitlin Harnett and Melbourneâ€™s Dylan-indebted Fraser A Gorman (his mantra: â€œCountry music sounds to me like rockâ€™nâ€™roll!â€). Jacklin rejects the suggestion that this thoughtful songcraft is a reaction against prevailing wiggier guitar trends down under, nor does she think it owes much to heartland Australian country music. To her, itâ€™s just the product of supportive communities.    Mercifully absent from their output are the tweed waistcoats and civil war fetishisation beloved of the Mumfords et al: this lot bring dark humour and self-awareness to what can often be a painfully earnest genre. â€œIf I am bound for something/ Honey, wonâ€™t you know that I always take the shortest fucking road,â€ Nadia Reid avers on Reaching Through, while Jacklin finds a pessimistic revelation in Leadlight: â€œI didnâ€™t know that the grass was not only greener/ Upkeep is cheaper when you embrace the rain.â€ Rather than follow Fleet Foxesâ€™ rustic trail signs, Jacklin says that discovering Father John Misty marked a turning point in her songwriting. Specifically, â€œthat it was OK to inject humour and sarcasm and to put ideas into his music,â€ she says. â€œIâ€™m not a very serious person, and getting up and playing serious music was boring to me.â€ Best tell the folks in Blue Ridge, there are new kids on the block. Julia Jacklinâ€™s Donâ€™t Let The Kids Win is out on 7 October on Transgressive",1
"It is less than a week since Donald Trump was elected as the next president of the United States. So it is hardly surprising that such an immense shock to the US and to the global political order is still only sinking in. To add to the shock, Mr Trump himself is now making almost daily statements which, in some cases, mark changes of direction or tone, few of which can yet be treated as definitive. The Trump triumph is an immense event, and immensely threatening, but there are still more than two months before his inauguration. It is likely that some of the instant response to his election, however passionately felt, may prove to be ephemeral and in some cases overheated. That is certainly true in Europe, and it is particularly true in Britain, where reactions have fallen far short. Like so many others, most of Europeâ€™s leaders were caught on the hop by last weekâ€™s result. They had expected and wanted Hillary Clinton to prevail. It therefore made sense for European Union foreign ministers to meet on Sunday to discuss the implications of the Trump victory. There was and is use in such exchanges, and the foreign secretary Boris Johnson was wrong to stay away, and especially foolish to patronise other Europeans for what he dubbed an anti-Trump whinge-o-rama. Nevertheless, just because Mr Johnson acted foolishly, it does not follow that Europe is right to get on its high horse about MrÂ Trump. Europe has plenty of problems of its own. Its underlying approach should be that of Angela Merkel, which is that Europe and America are linked by values of democracy and respect which they should cooperate to uphold. It made no sense to use the weekendâ€™s meetings to give the impression that Europe is a place of political virtue and America one of political turpitude. NeitherÂ thing is true. And saying it to the newÂ president, however alarming he is, may be bad politics. The reaction in Britain, especially on the pro-Brexit right, has been more absurd and solipsistic still. Much of it is driven by the triumphalism of the rightwing press and the isolationist English right. In reality, though, it does not matter whether Theresa May was first, ninth or 90th in the list of heads of government to speak to Mr Trump. Nor does it matter whether Nigel Farage and his entourage got to see Mr Trump before an elected British politician did. Diversions of this kind only matter to those who live and breathe in the Brexiter bubble. What matters to the rest of Britain is the kind of long-term relationship that will be possible with Mr Trumpâ€™s America and with the EU-27. TheÂ rest is froth. Mr Johnson lets Britain down by treating both the Trump danger and the EU response so flippantly. Tonight Theresa May began to bring things back to earth in the prime ministerâ€™s traditional speech at the London lord mayorâ€™s banquet. Not for the first time, she gave an interesting but flawed speech. To her credit, Mrs May at least understands that Mr Trumpâ€™s election was caused in part by some voters feeling left behind by the unfairnesses of the liberal global order. She gets it about the downsides, in ways that too few politicians can emulate. She sees the need for politicians to understand and respond to that kind of anxiety. And she grasps that the overarching public policy question for western countries in the early 21st century is how to give voters the confidence that globalisation and liberal values work for them not against them. The questions she posed in tonightâ€™s speech are important and serious. The prime minister is attempting to resolve the tensions that exist between the nation state, democracy and globalisation in the modern age. This is more important than speculating over whether Mrs May will be Thatcher to Mr Trumpâ€™s Reagan. But Mrs Mayâ€™s problem is that she does not have the answer to her own big public policy question, especially in the destructive context of Brexit. The trick is to effectively manage globalisation. Ideally this would be done in as democratic a way as possible. It involves responsive controls over capital, goods and labour within the frame of liberalised trading relations, within which governments work together to set rules that businesses must follow. But that is not the answer towards which Mrs Mayâ€™s Brexit-dominated government is groping its way. She is right about the goal â€“ to manage globalisation in ways that preserve liberal values and that work for everyone â€“ but she does not know how to get there, above all because Brexit makes that task infinitelyÂ harder.",1

"18 Unregulated Chemicals Found In Drinking Water Across The United StatesArjun Walia They did it by analyzing single samples of untreated and treated water from 25 U.S utilities that voluntarily participated in the study. A total of 21 contaminates were found, and 18 of them are chemicals that are not regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. A research hydrologist with the USGS,Dana Kolpin, who participated in the study said that the good news is the concentrations are generally pretty low. Personally, I dont think that there is any good news that comes from the fact that 18 unregulated, unhealthy chemicals were found. Sure, they might be in low concentrations, but human beings drink water every day, constantly for their whole life. Four of these chemicals were metal strontium, the herbicide metolachlor, PFOS and PFOA. Perfluorinated chemicals are persistent, bioaccumulative toxicants. Widespread human exposures, including in fetuses, is well documented. PFOS is considered unusually persistent, unable to breakdown under any known conditions, thus remaining in our environment forever, posing threats of ongoing exposure and toxicity to humans and wildlife. The most scrutinized PFCs have toxic profiles that include cancer and reproductive/developmental effects. Initial studies in humans show an inverse relationship between PFOS exposures and growth parameters in newborns, although the findings are inconsistent. More recently, scientists have identified a potential link between PFCs and infertility. (6) While the federal government is slowly beginning to acknowledge the hazards associated with fluorinated chemicals, their response so far has been limited primarily to further study and voluntary agreements with manufactures on only a few of the chemicals of concern.(6) Its also important to note that PFOs have been linked to attention deficit disorders.(4) The Strontium found in the water can also affect bone growth. PFOs arent removed in treated drinking water either, similar concentrations were found in the treated water and the untreated water. Only one plant was successful at removing them, and it used activated carbon treatment. So what can we do? We must protect our water. Clean safe drinking water should be the right of every human being on the planet. Unfortunately, it can be costly today. Its best to make sure that you have a good water filter, nobody should be drinking tap water anywhere in North America. The Safe Drinking Water Act only regulates 91 potential water contaminants. In the US alone, over 60,000 chemicals are used that can find their way into water supplies. Many of them have been identified as possible carcinogens. Current estimates suggest that there is more than 2,100 known chemical toxins present in U.S. tap water. Cities with older pipelines also face problems as chemicals leach from the lines as the water travels. As we move forward into 2014 people across the planet are raising their voices in a very critical time. Now more than ever, we must speak for ourplanet and protect its natural resources, especially our water. Many of us take water for granted, forgetting that a large portion of people do not even have access to clean, safe drinking water. Just like everything else, water has fallen into the hands of a few corporations. Not long ago, the CEO of Nestle said that clean, free public drinking water should not be a basic human right. Water is very sacred, essential for life and its our responsibility to protect it.

"Obama Takes Blame For Worst Military Technology MisObama is trying so hard to take away guns from Americans citizens. And yet here he is, sending sensitive military technology to other countries (and the wrong countries). Obama sent a Hellfire missile to Cuba that was supposed to be sent to Europe.

"How To Prepare For A Hurricane? Some Lessons That Preppers Can Learn From Hurricane SandyMichael Snyder, Contributor Those that have prepared ahead of time are likely to be in good shape to ride this storm out, but sadly the reality is that most people have not prepared ahead of time. Every time a major storm or natural disaster strikes, we always see the same thing happen. Hordes of half-crazed people storm into the stores hoping to find the things that they need, and many of them end up leaving disappointed because what they were looking for has already sold out. Thankfully, most of our disasters have typically only lasted a few days at most, but what will happen someday if a disaster ends up being permanent? What if there is a disaster that is so bad someday that things never return to normal? Would you and your family be able to survive on only the preparations that you have made so far? Hopefully Hurricane Sandy will be a wake up call for a whole lot of people. It is being projected that this storm will affect about 50 million Americans, and it is already been called worse than Katrina by some meteorologists. It is an absolutely gigantic storm. It is more than 1000 miles across and it is the largest hurricane to hit the U.S. since records of storm size began to be kept back in 1988. According to Stu Ostro, a senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel, this is truly a history making storm History is being written as an extreme weather event continues to unfold, one which will occupy a place in the annals of weather history as one of the most extraordinary to have affected the United States. So a lot of Americans are about to find out exactly how prepared they really are for a major natural disaster. High winds of 80 MPH or higher are going to take down power lines all over the northeast over the next few days. Along the coast, some people could see a storm surge that is up to 15 feet above sea level in some areas. Other areas will see nightmarish flooding as a result of very heavy rain. So there will certainly be a lot of challenges. The good thing about a hurricane is that you typically have at least a few days in advance to make preparations. Hopefully people have been making good use of the time. Unfortunately, most Americans do not even have a short-term supply of food and water stored up. A lot of people run out to grab some food and water from the stores at the last minute, only to find that there is none left. For example, it is being reported that store shelves all over New York City have already been picked clean of bread and other essentials. In Arlington, Virginia it is being reported that some supermarkets are already sold out of water. If the worst happens and some people end up spending a week without tap water they are really going to wish that they had made some preparations ahead of time. But food and water are not the only things in high demand. According to CNN, other emergency supplies have been flying off the shelves as well Generators, flashlights, water, batteries these are just some of the emergency supplies that are running out in many stores in the Northeast. Nearly a third of the countrys northeast is preparing for Hurricane Sandy, which expected to make landfall on Sunday and Monday. Customers who have been flocking to stores may be coming home empty handed. Fortunately this is only a temporary emergency, but what if we have a permanent emergency someday? What will people do if they cant find the things that they desperately need all of a sudden? An assistant manager at a Lowes store in Columbus, Ohio, told 10TV.com that people were calling in from West Virginia and Maryland to ask for supplies. And in northern Virginia, a cashier at Pitkins Ace Hardware in Dale City said batteries, flashlights and candles were flying off the shelves, PotomacLocal.com reports. When will people learn? You dont wait until the last minute to get necessary emergency supplies like plywood, hurricane shutters, tarps, sump pumps, ice chests, candles, flashlights, batteries and battery-powered radios. So exactly how should one prepare for a hurricane? Ready.gov provides the following list of tips To prepare for a hurricane, you should take the following measures: A recent CNN article included a list of supplies that you should have on hand in the event that a hurricane is on the way A three-day supply of water, one gallon per person per day. But in the final analysis, preparation is going to look a little bit different for every family. If you live along the coast, there is a good chance that you will need to evacuate. If you live farther inland, you will probably be able to hunker down exactly where you are. That is something to think about. Hopefully we will all reflect on emergency preparedness over the next few days. Our world is becoming increasingly unstable, and eventually there will come a point where we will find ourselves totally dependent on the preparations that we have made.

"The Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case. And it has undermined our constitution in the process. The government appears to be fuelling this attack. Sajid Javid, the local government secretary, described the judges as seeking to â€œthwart the will of the peopleâ€. The judiciary is a pillar of our constitution. Allow faith in the judges toÂ be eroded and that pillar is eroded at a huge cost to our freedoms. The front page of the Daily Mail labelled the three judges â€œenemies of the peopleâ€. It described Sir Terence Etherton as the first â€œopenly gayâ€ judge, detailed Sir Philip Salesâ€™ earnings when he was a barrister and worked for the government and captioned a photograph of the third judge â€œThe Europhile: Lord Chief Justice Thomasâ€. The Sun and the Daily Telegraph stooped to spraying abuse with the same lack of concern for the constitutional place of the judiciary in our democracy.   Related: Brexit plans in disarray as high court rules parliament must have its say   Our judges do not do politics. They do law. They are selected to be judges on their legal ability. Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection â€“ which is not, for example, the case in the US. The judges of the American supreme court, when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election, which was contested in the courts, each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them. So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic. One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts. This attracts business to the UK, because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics. The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be: who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing peopleâ€™s rights on the prime ministerâ€™s say-so, and undermining casually the authority of judges? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict: judges against the people. We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote. But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process. Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution.   Related: As Gina Millerâ€™s lawyers, we fought and won a victory for democracy | Emily Nicholson and Katy Colton   There is very little doubt, when you read this judgment, that the judges haveÂ loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance withÂ the law and the facts. The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 wereÂ an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, werenâ€™t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit shouldÂ beÂ delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally notÂ unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way. Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they canâ€™t defend themselves. Thatâ€™s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so. The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer. They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine ourÂ country. There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome â€“ which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard. Trussâ€™s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldnâ€™t care less about the constitution.",1
"KNOW THAT HE IS Everybody knew David Brent wasnâ€™t perfect. He didnâ€™t always say the right thing, didnâ€™t mind a dance and didnâ€™t mind a lager. A pint thereof. But the workplace seemed a more exciting place with him around. However, sweet management gigs donâ€™t last forever, particularly when there is inappropriate behaviour in front of the cameras, and after what seemed like no time at all, it was all over.

"The â€œKing Learâ€ evoked in â€œSongs of Learâ€ shares so little with Shakespeareâ€™s tragedy that the showâ€™s director, Grzegorz Bral, delivers an explanatory introduction onstage. This is doubly helpful because â€œSongs of Learâ€ also shares little with traditional, linear storytelling, and large parts of it are in untranslated Latin and Polish â€” in other words, itâ€™s hard to tell whatâ€™s going on. While you donâ€™t need to know â€œKing Learâ€ to appreciate the show, it certainly helps.But then this is an impression of the play, not a staging of it, and much of the material extrapolates on the famous tale.The hourlong production, from the Wroclaw company Song of the Goat Theater and playing a short run at BAM, is structured as a series of vignettes that Mr. Bral calls â€œpaintingsâ€ though they rely entirely on singing, much of it a cappella. The dominant character here turns out to be Cordelia (played by various actors), who drives the most intense paintings. An especially striking one imagines her pain and anger as a child. In another, she warns her father of his impending doom, backed by a violin and a mournful harmonium.Some of the lyrics are lifted from the play, but the rest will be mystifying to those not versed in Latin or Polish. Yet choral singing, even when incomprehensible, has a way of casting a spell â€” there is a reason Gregorian chants remain popular and the eerily beautiful â€œLe MystÃ¨re des Voix Bulgaresâ€ records were hits in the late 1980s.Letting the songs carry the showâ€™s emotional burden might have been enough if the music by Jean-Claude Acquaviva â€” a founding member of the vocal group A Filetta, which has been key in the renaissance of Corsican polyphonic singing â€” and Maciej Rychly was a little more diverse.Deviations from the ethereal norm stand out all the more, most notably a powerful war-themed vignette in which the cast members pound on chairs as if they were percussion. Suddenly itâ€™s as if we were watching the Dothraki warriors from â€œGame of Thronesâ€ field a team in a â€œPitch Perfectâ€ movie: viscerally awe inspiring.",1
"Caramelized oranges are an old-school dessert, a simple, stylish 1970s confection popularized in a cooking course published as a monthly magazine by Londonâ€™s Le Cordon Bleu. Exotic and sweetly astringent, they were a standby of posh dinner parties throughout the Commonwealth, the sort of dish that was not particularly difficult to make but still signaled a home cookâ€™s understanding of elegance. Jennifer McLagan, the Australian chef and writer, wrote in â€˜â€˜Bitter: A Taste of the Worldâ€™s Most Dangerous Flavor, With Recipes,â€™â€™ that she read the recipe when it was first published, and that the oranges were one of the first dishes she ever made for dinner guests.Modern recipes for caramelized oranges abound, particularly among British cooks. Nigel Slater has one; so, too, does Nigella Lawson; so does Sophie Grigson. (Long before them, Elizabeth David wrote appreciatively of caramelized Sicilian oranges in her 1954 book, â€˜â€˜Italian Food.â€™â€™) The instructions for making them are all roughly similar. Carefully peeled oranges or orange slices are doused in caramel, sometimes to candy them, other times to infuse them with the rich taste of the silken sugar. Some recipes add rum to the mix, or a drop of Grand Marnier. â€˜â€˜When executed thoughtfully,â€ Slater wrote a few years ago in The Guardian, â€œthe recipe is a ray of winter sunshine in a sweet, citrusy syrup.â€™â€™My own recipe calls for saffron, which infuses the sauce with its sweet-savory, haylike aroma. I also take a wide view of the fruit, and use assorted citrus instead of just oranges. The differences in size, acidity and sweetness make the dish all the more fascinating. It is the sort of recipe you can execute in the late afternoon, in advance of cooking a main course, then leave in the fridge to chill until you serve it after the dinner plates have been cleared.There are only two tricky parts to the cooking, and they are really only tricky the first time you execute the dish. The first is to attend closely to the removal of all the white pith beneath the skin of the citrus, since it is exceedingly bitter and, as Slater notes, leaving it on makes it seem as if you donâ€™t care. Second, watch that caramel closely as you cook, swirling the mixture of sugar and water over the heat until it bubbles and darkens and approaches what the Latin American chef Francis Mallmann has called â€˜â€˜the uncertain edge of burnt.â€™â€™The uncertain edge of burnt. Home cooks freak out about lines like that. They picture smoking-black pans, alarms screaming, hours of scrubbing at the sink to remove the damage done. Donâ€™t worry. Just work slowly, and watch carefully. First-timers or members of the belt-and-suspenders crowd can even set up an emergency station to stop the cooking of the caramel immediately: a clean, stoppered sink with an inch or so of cold water in it. If you feel your caramel is going too far, remove the pan from the heat and carefully dip its bottom into the cool water to stop it from cooking further.I build the dessert on a pillow of Greek yogurt to provide contrast and heft, a trick I learned from Lawson, placing the sliced citrus on top of it in a pattern to evoke the 1970s, from which it came. (If you have leftovers in the morning, try them with yet more yogurt and a shake of granola.) When the caramel is done and cooled slightly, pour it carefully over the top of the fruit, and slide the serving platter into the refrigerator to chill. A rest there for about an hour yields a slightly crunchy top to the fruit, but longer refrigeration delivers syrup that runs into the yogurt, staining it with the rust of the saffron, like tendrils of sunset on distant clouds.Recipe: Caramelized Citrus",1
"Little Girls Lemonade Stand Shut for Not Getting a $3,500 PermitBy Justin Gardner But her passion is being tested by the regulatory hand of the State. Orange County authorities shut down Annabelles small business and gave her 30 days to get the proper permit and license. The permit will cost around $200, but in order to secure the permit Annabelle will have to meet a bevy of government requirements costing $3,500 just to serve fresh-squeezed fruit juices to thirsty passersby. According to the GoFundMe account set up by the Lockwoods to help meet this financial burden levied by the State: 1.She needs to upgrade her cart to get it up to commercial standards, in order to pass the inspection. 2. She needs to make the lemonade in a licensed facility. Licensed kitchens require: Liability insurance, a business license, a deposit and an hourly or monthly fee for use. 3. She needs commercial grade dispensers and bottles. The family has received enormous support after media began telling Annabelles story, but in the meantime she has had to turn down a wedding, corporate events, movies in the park and church events, according to local KTLA 5. Annabelle had previously set up her stand to help charities such as childrens cancer research and homeless services, but that was put on hold pending government permitting. This isnt just another business venture its becoming a life lesson for a young ambitious entrepreneur. She will be able to do so much more in the community as well as at charity and school events to help others. Shes extremely passionate about her business, and we are so proud of her for creating something that so many others can enjoy! Its turning out to be a hard and fast lesson in how government requirements on businesses many of which play no role in protecting people or the environment put a heavy, unnecessary burden on aspiring entrepreneurs. Revenue collection is often the only driver of government permits and licenses. Bearing down on the age-old tradition of youngsters setting up lemonade stands demonstrates how obsessed the State has become in regulating small business. It appears that Annabelle made it through the gauntlet, with the help of many who donated to her GoFundMe account after reading her story. Others are not so fortunate, though. In Portland, Ore. an 11-year-old girl wanted to sell mistletoe from their farm at a holiday market to help her dad pay for her braces, which cost $5,000. But the Parks Bureau refused to let her set up without a permit, lease or concession agreement. She was told she could beg instead. Justin Gardner writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared. I am surprised about that as under common law there is an inalienable right to do free commerce. Sadly If under pressure you start to register and beg for a licence then you lose all the common law right and need to go trough all the loops, but if you hold your ground, there is no need for such idiocy that is the bureaucracy created by the leeches. Our wonderful government in action Always be a light that is shininginthedark As far as the mistletoe girl goes; it is not a prepared product but a harvested one there are no restrictions on selling it from a farmers market. Whomever told her this was overstepping their authority. You would have to pay the markets fee for a table only. It is a wonder why the government did not send in a SWAP team and murder the girl, just to make it clear that you have got to follow the government rules. Statism idiocracy at its finest. BTW: guess I ate smuggled burritos from a guy that was selling them out of his ice chest. You are not allowed to make money unless some government entity gets a cut of the action. If anyone can explain how this is different from how the Mafia works, maybe they can enlighten us. We all know this is licensing to eliminate low cost competition. This is at the low end. We also see it at the high end for pharma drug testing, medical device testing, professional licensing, etc. Orange Co. USED to be red. Now they are big gov toofor a lemonade stand.Idiots. Singapore would WELCOME her with open arms and NO regulationsnone.that is where the youth of this country need to be going FREEDOM is THERE not HEREas we the people have let FREEDOM and LIBERTY be TAKEN from us by our ELECTEDemployees.and their rules and regulations to make everything safe and secure forTHEM.POWER is what they want and POWER is what we have ALLOWED them to TAKE from us.OUR FAULT.maybe if we elect TRUMP we the people can regained somne power backBUT most power has been lost at the LOCAL levelso time to run the LOCAL ELECTED POWER HUNGRY politicians OUT OF OFFICE.reduce rules and regulationsimho Limp wristed faggots. CAWS IDEA THAT THIS IS LIKE A FRAMERS MARKET ITEM SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LOGICAL AND RATIONAL COMPROMISE FOR THE COMMON GOOD. OUR REPRESENTATIVES, ELECTED TO MANAGE THE NECESSARY SOCIETAL INSTITUTIONS ON OUR BEHALF, ARE NOT REPRESENTING USE US FOR THE COMMON GOOD. ONE 6 YEAR TERM LIMITS STARTING WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS IS THE 21ST CENTURY SYSTEMIC CHANGE NEEDED AND DOABLE NOW.

Our tax dollars hard at work, extorting more money from our children. The local gestapo can get lost, because they are in it for the money grab. Would they have liability if people got sick from her lemonade? Nope, the licensing authority has no legal liability, so why are they taking money? Seriously, the local gestapo should go after real ILLEGAL ALIENS who are working in restaurants all over town. Do you think the Chipotle disease outbreak was caused by LEGAL citizens? Nope, ILLEGAL ALIENS who are too ignorant and lazy to wash their hands after using the bathroom. ",0
"States are putting hundreds of thousands of people directly into jobs through programs reminiscent of the more ambitious work projects of the Great Depression. But the new efforts have a twist: While the wages are being paid by the government, most of the participants are working for private companies. The opportunity to simultaneously benefit struggling workers and small businesses has helped these job subsidies gain support from liberals and conservatives. Congress is now considering whether to extend the subsidy, which would expire in September, for an additional year. A House vote is expected Thursday or Friday. Despite questions about whether the programs displace existing workers, many economists have argued that direct job creation programs are a more cost-effective way to put some of the nation's 14.6 million unemployed back to work than indirect alternatives like tax credits and construction projects. The average duration of unemployment continues to break records, after all, and studies have shown that the longer people are out of work, the less employable they become. Proponents of these national job subsidies, initially financed with $5 billion of stimulus money, say it is better to pay people for working in real jobs than to pay them jobless benefits for staying idle. Placing workers in the private sector is also more promising than giving them make-work government jobs, they say, because market forces can be harnessed to figure out where people like Tremaine Edwards, 35, a former computer technician who had been unemployed for two years before he was hired in May by Gallery Guichard, a private gallery in Chicago, should invest their skills for the long run. Others contend that training and financing will accomplish little if businesses are unwilling to hire on their own. So far just over a billion dollars has been approved to create subsidized employment programs in 36 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The biggest year-round program is run by Illinois, which has put 22,000 workers in subsidized jobs (and 5,000 in subsidized summer youth jobs) and has 30,000 people on its waiting list. Most states pay 100 percent of workers' wages up to a certain point. To qualify for the subsidy, workers must have a low household income. They must also have minor children or be under age 21 themselves. Employers seem to hear about the programs largely through word of mouth, and some states actively help match eligible workers with companies. These eligibility restrictions are part of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, created in the welfare reform legislation of 1996, which is now being used to channel the job subsidy money to states. States, cities and local companies have been among the biggest advocates for extending the program beyond September. Small businesses benefit in particular since having an additional worker can make a bigger difference to a company with a small staff. Getting a worker at no cost can also free up cash for other types of investments. ",1
"According to a new report released Monday by a panel of top economists and social scientists, the People's Republic of China will overtake the United States as the world's dominant asshole by the year 2020. The findings, published in the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs, support recent speculation that America's unquestioned reign as the leading super-prick may soon be drawing to a close, leaving China as the foremost shithead among all developed nations. 'We are seeing a changing of the asshole guard,' said Andrew Freireich, noted economist and lead author of the article. 'Although the U.S. will remain among the world's two or three biggest cocks through much of this century, we can now confidently project that China, with its soaring economic growth, ever-expanding cultural influence, and total disregard for basic human rights, will overtake America as King Prick Numero Uno within the next 10 years.' Added Freireich, 'It's the dawning of a new huge bastard era.' According to the report, China has slowly emerged as a massive fucker over the past half century, a period of egotistical growth unseen since America's booming douche years following World War II. According to estimates, China already has a slight lead on the U.S. in not giving a fuck about climate change. Over that same time, China has seen a dramatic rise in both its GDP and Shithead Index, definite signs that the Asian nation is developing into a cocksucker of global proportions. 'When you consider China's wanton pollution, rising militarism, and rampant overdevelopment, it's clear they'll soon be thoroughly out-dicking the U.S. in every measurable area,' international affairs specialist Neil Farren said. 'Not many Americans want to admit it, but as the yuan continues to get stronger, and millions upon millions are exploited as a result, more and more people worldwide will be looking to China, not America, and saying, 'Man, can you believe what an unbelievable sack of shit that country is?'' China's ascension to supreme asshole status is occurring at a much faster pace than experts originally predicted. In fact, many now believe that by as early as 2015 Chinese citizens will arrogantly strut across the globe disrespecting other cultures and shouting loudly while dressed in XXL 'Speak Chinese or Go Home' T-shirts. Prominent scholars claim that America's gradual fall from the upper echelon of international supershits is merely part of an inevitable pattern seen time and again throughout world history. 'All of the great asshole nations eventually watch their day in the sun slip away,' historian Richard Merriam told reporters. 'Don't forget that Great Britain was the world's dominant asshole for well over three centuries, and look at it now: a pussy-whipped shell of the insufferable, bullying jackass it used to be.' Others have posited that China's ascension may be part of a larger reorganization of the global asshole hegemony that could see the United States losing even more ground in the century to come. 'A country like Iran is obviously a pretty big dick, but ultimately it lacks the resources to be a truly world-class asshole,' Farran said. 'Same goes for Pakistan. But the list of abominable shit-heel countries competing for global prick dominance is a long one, and the U.S. is just going to have to get used to seeing countries like Russia and India mentioned in the same breath as itself.' 'Many Americans are going to be upset over the prospect of falling from that top spot, but that's the reality we face,' Farrar continued. 'Hopefully, the United States will find a way to grow and adjust to its evolving role on the world stage without acting like a complete and utter fuckhead about it.' ",0
"Worries about Deutsche Bank are currently outweighing the relief rally which followed the US presidential debate, with leading shares now deeper in the red. So investors are looking for safer stocks, and utility companies are fitting the bill. Severn Trent is up 20p at Â£24.83 with SSE 18p better at Â£15.46. And United Utilities has climbed 12p to 998p after the business issued a positive trading update. It said first half operating profits were expected to be marginally higher than the same period last year, with infrastructure renewal spending slightly lower but picking up in the second half. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said:  Although bid speculation has raised its head recently the main appeal for investors in United Utilities remains its defensive nature, healthy yield and aim of increasing its dividends in line with inflation through to at least 2020. In the volatile and uncertain markets post Brexit, and in a very low interest rate environment, those are powerful attractions for investors seeking income with lower risk.  But overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 15.01 points at 6803.03. Banking shares remain under pressure on the concerns about Deutsche Bank, down another 3%, and its ability to pay a hefty fine threated by the US Department of Justice. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:  The continuation of Deutsche Bankâ€™s decline seems to have spoilt the post-presidential debate relief, with the markets resuming a lesser version of yesterdayâ€™s fall.  The German bank is now down another 3%, and is threatening to drop under â‚¬10 for the first time in around 30 years. This has sparked another round of losses in the European banking sector, with Barclays, HSBC and Societe Generale all seeing notable declines. Royal Bank of Scotland actually surpassed Deutsche Bankâ€™s morning drop, percentage-wise at least, with investors fearful that the same kind of fine could hit RBS when its settlement with the US Department of Justice is finally revealed.    Royal Bank of Scotland has fallen 7.5p to 170p while Standard Chartered is down 14.1p at 611.6p after allegations of impropriety at an Indonesican company its private equity arm had invested in. The bank said it had referred the matter to the appropriate authorities and conducted its own review.  ",1
"Kering, the French luxury-good group that owns the brands Alexander McQueen, Saint Laurent and Gucci, among others, and has made something of a mission out of championing womenâ€™s rights â€” with initiatives like the Chime for Change campaign for female empowerment, the â€œWomen in Motionâ€ talks for film industry professionals and a partnership with the United Nations Women French National Committee â€” has put its human-resources policy where its cause is.Also, probably not coincidentally, where its customer base is.Last week, the conglomerate  announced a new parental-leave policy that, to many, might seem like a luxury itself: a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity or adoptive leave and five days of paternity or partner leave, beginning Jan. 1, 2017 for all employees who have worked there for more than a year.What made the move unusual was that the group, which operates in nearly 60 countries and employs more than 38,000 people, established the policy across all brands and all locations.â€œThese decisions are usually made country by country and not across borders,â€ said Ariane Hegewisch, the program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Womenâ€™s Policy Research. â€œHuman resource management, such as benefit policies and pay levels, is very influenced by national legislation, labor markets and the union structures in different countries.â€Previously, Keringâ€™s various brands set their own policies, in compliance with local regulations. That means its 5,000-plus employees in the U.S., where federal law mandates only 12 weeks unpaid time off for new parents, were offered either no compensated time off or a combination of paid and unpaid leave. Meanwhile, Keringâ€™s Italian contingent â€” about 7,000 people â€” was given 22 weeks of maternity leave and three to four days of paternity leave with at least 80 percent of the salary paid out.That approach is not atypical in luxury, an industry focused on attracting women (80 percent of Keringâ€™s consumers are women). MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH, which owns fashion houses like Dior, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, has different policies in different places, as does Prada Group, an umbrella organization for Prada, Miu Miu, Churchâ€™s and more, as well as Phillips-Van Heusen, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, among others.But Keringâ€™s move has placed it among a growing list of multinational companies, including NestlÃ©, Lâ€™Oreal and Spotify, that have set minimum parental-leave standards across all geographic zones where their employees work in the last few years. LVMH is set to follow in Keringâ€™s footsteps this spring with a program called â€œCoeur Social,â€ which will include a global parental-leave policy.A report by the Center for American Progress argued that companies are taking these actions to balance out discrepancies in benefits across regions, in particular the unequal leave policies between the U.S. and most other nations (research focusing on members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a few other nations found that the U.S. was the only one that didnâ€™t mandate paid parental leave).â€œI think these companies realize they can retain women who leave and come back, and that is a real cost saver for them,â€ said Myra H. Strober, a professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. â€œItâ€™s very much an economic decision for them, and thatâ€™s good, because those tend to stick.â€Among fashion, beauty and retail companies that have made their parental-leave policies public, Keringâ€™s offer of 14 paid weeks for mothers and parents who adopt stands out. â€œThis is a private company, so an investment of 14 weeks is high,â€ said Ms. Hegewisch.By comparison, Patagonia, considered a leader in sustainability, gives its workers 80 days of maternity leave and 60 days of paternity leave, both paid. Toms Shoes offers eight weeks for all parents; Jane.com gives 30 days of maternity or adoptive leave; Old Navy allows 60 days of job-protected, unpaid maternity leave; and Phillips-Van Heusen offers 12-14 weeks paid for birthing mothers and six weeks paid for all other parents.Still, Ms. Hegewisch expressed surprise at the stark difference between Keringâ€™s maternity and paternity leaves. Though Kering brands such as Gucci and Bottega Veneta have decided to merge genders on the runway, they havenâ€™t made the same leap in leave policies.â€œFive days is really very minimal,â€ she said of the companyâ€™s paternity leave.According to someone familiar with the discussions at Kering who was not authorized to speak, the company based the number of days on recommendations from the International Labor Organization, which adopted a resolution in 2000 stating that women should be entitled to a minimum of 14 weeks maternity leave, but hasnâ€™t established any formal guidelines for paternity leave.Kering declined to comment publicly on the policies beyond its announcement last week.Ms. Strober noted that thereâ€™s more of an uphill battle in getting fathers to take time off, even when itâ€™s available to them.â€œEven when companies have more generous paternity-leave policies, fathers donâ€™t always take advantage of them,â€ she said. â€œIt took years of Sweden having a national program giving men paternity leave before they began to take it.â€She added: â€œEventually â€” donâ€™t ask me when â€” men and women will have the same parental leaves and they will all take them. But weâ€™re not there yet.â€",1
"Admitting that the promotion has not been as successful as they would have hoped, salespeople at Mattingly Perkins Automotive told reporters Wednesday that they are giving serious thought to putting an end to the car dealerships sponsorship deal with convicted pedophile and current spokesman Jerry Sandusky. With as much as people around here love the Nittany Lions, we figured taking a former Penn State football coach and making him the face of our business was a surefire move, but I have to say that the reception so far has been pretty lukewarm, said senior sales manager Ralph Perkins, referring to the dealerships ongoing arrangement with Sandusky, in which the alleged child molesters image and personal testimonials have been used to plug new and used sedans, pickup trucks, and SUVs. Frankly, a lot of our customers appear extremely disgusted that weve chosen to go this route, but at this point it feels like were pretty committed to the promotion. I mean, that giant inflatable Sandusky out front cost us a good two grand, and weve got like 15 cardboard cutouts of him set up in the showroom. But unless we start moving some serious volume, we may want to at least weigh our options. Perkins added that management was also considering a move to pull a locally aired commercial in which Sandusky drives up to the dealership in a flashy convertible, hops out to kick a football squarely through the uprights, and then celebrates with dozens of ecstatic children.

"It is 10 years since England defeated South Africa and two of the defeats in the 12-match unsuccessful sequence since then came in 2007 when their head coach, Eddie Jones, was part of the Springboksâ€™ management team in that yearâ€™s World Cup. Having masterminded a series whitewash earlier this year against another of his former teams, Australia, he has given his squad an insight into the psyche of Saturdayâ€™s opponents at Twickenham. South Africa may not be as imposing as they were in 2007, when they defeated England in the World Cup final having thrashed them in the group stage, but Jones has told his players to expect an early onslaught as the Springboks look to impose themselves physically. A year ago Jones was on his way to South Africa to take charge of the Stormers. He had barely got his feet under Table Mountain when England came calling and this week he finds himself plotting against a fellow member of the South Africa coaching team nine years ago, Allister Coetzee, who took charge of the Springboks earlier this year. â€œHe has a sharp rugby brain and is very good with people,â€ said Jones. â€œHe is also the type of guy who can absorb the pressure he is under now. South Africa have had a terrible year and lost four of their last five Tests, so imagine you are a Springbok, copping it from every conceivable place â€“ the media, fans and friends. â€œIt is a difficult time for them with a new coach having lost some of the biggest icons of the game. â€œThey have one crack at redemption, beating England. Do that and they go home heroes. They will arrive with a certain amount of desperation. And desire changes performance, as was seen at Munster the other week. South Africa are almost at the point of no return and we have to be able to match their desire. We know what we are going to get and it will come down to our playersâ€™ mind set.â€ England will confront South Africa head on and in the Vunipola brothers, Billy and Mako, they have two players who not only relish physical confrontation but have a creative side to their game that is taking them towards the world-class status Jones believes England have lacked for too long. The pair have stood out for Saracens this season, with the prop Mako for once generating more notice than his younger sibling flanker. â€œI would rather he did well than me because people have always wanted to talk to me, not my brother,â€ said Billy. â€œHe is playing well and I know he is probably a better rugby player than me and most of our forwards. He has got that hard edge to his game but also the soft hands. We have to stay humble and keep on top of our work or we will get complacent. â€œWe know we have to knuckle down and work hard if we are to beat South Africa. Victory is not just going to arrive. Eddie has drummed it in that it is not going to be easy and with his experience I am not going to question him. We have a great squad and it is an opportunity for us to take the ship forward. â€œSouth Africa are a straightforward team. They have got very big players who are skilful and the rugby they play means that, if you do not stand up to them, you are going to get beaten. Eddie said they like to try and break teams down by playing on top of them. You have to stand up to that and I would rather someone ran at me rather than round me.â€",1
"A Facebook page set up to encourage Taiwan residents to look for mistakes in bilingual signs in public areas has attracted more than 1,100 fans, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Friday. A total of 1,168 netizens now follow the page where people can upload photos of mistakes or improper usage of English in local signs and provide corrections to win free gifts, ranging from a Wii to an iPod. The campaign, launched in September, was an attempt to correct English mistakes on signs seen in facilities or areas under the ministry's jurisdiction, including railway stations, airports, and national scenic areas. The ministry gave a few examples of some bad English that probably drew a few laughs before being corrected. A vendor at the Sinying service plaza, for instance, translated 'lemon Aiyu jelly' directly from the Chinese to 'the lemon loves the jade.' In another case, 'watch out for snakes' was mistakenly written as 'watch out for snacks' in the Siraya National Scenic Area in southern Taiwan. Other errors included misspellings such as 'mussum' for museum and 'champing' for camping, according to the social-networking page. There have been 38 photos posted by the site's fans so far. The campaign will run to the end of January 2011. ",1
"BREAKING: Terrifying News Released About Terrorist Attack In New York City According to recent reports, a bomb was detonated on Saturday in New York, and another explosive device was found nearby. Investigations revealed that both were shrapnel-filled pressure cookers, similar to the bombs used at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The New York Times said the two devices used flip phones and Christmas lights to trigger the explosive. The blast ended up injuring 29 people in the Chelsea area of Manhattan. Though officials have ruled this an act of terror, as of yesterday morning no motive or suspect has been identified. The second device was found just four blocks from the site of the explosion and was removed before it was detonated. New York governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed it was similar in design to the exploded device. Both were different than the pipe bomb that detonated earlier during a charity race in New Jersey. Fortunately, that explosion did not end in injuries. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Of course, many question whether this has connections to ISIS. Was it a political motivation? A personal motivation? We do not know, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio commented. We know there was a bombing. We know its a very serious incident. But we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this. All possible theories of whats happened here and how it connects will be looked at but we have no specific evidence at this point in time. Approximately 1,000 extra security personnel are being deployed to New Yorks transport hubs following the incident, police confirmed. Well update you as more information arises on this matter. ",0

"  Related: What do Bannon and Priebus tell us about Trump's coming reign? | Richard Wolffe   I was marching up New Yorkâ€™s Fifth Avenue on Saturday afternoon behind a woman carrying a sign that read: â€œKeep your tiny hands off my pussy.â€ We were heading towards a looming tower with tinted windows where the president-elect lives and I thought to myself: this is absurd. We should not think of any of this as â€œnormalâ€. Nor should we consider it normal that one of the president-electâ€™s team appeared to hint that the Senate minority leader might face legal consequences for saying Donald Trump has emboldened bigotry; nor that theyâ€™ve refused to rule out jailing Hillary Clinton; nor that he plans to â€œimmediatelyâ€ deport three million immigrants; nor that heâ€™s hired a documented racist, Islamophobic, antisemitic demagogue to help him run the White House; nor that heâ€™s taken to Twitter to spread lies about the New York Times for reporting on him. So letâ€™s not. Letâ€™s not accept any of this as a new normal. Letâ€™s resist normalization at every step â€“ in our minds, our words and our actions. We begin by giving hell to anyone who tries to normalize the racist, misogynist, xenophobic bully who will soon be president. In the primaries, it was disgusting when Republicans like Chris Christie endorsed him, folding his racism and hatred into normal Republican political discourse.  News media normalized him when they let him phone into their shows and asked him softball questions. Entertainment media normalized him when NBC invited him him to host SNL and had Jimmy Fallon mess up his hair. Now, itâ€™s not just Republicans doing this: Oprah Winfrey, lobbyists, unions, businesses, traditional media companies, social media companies and many Democrats seem to want to act like Trump can be folded into normal business.    Related: Click and elect: how fake news helped Donald Trump win a real election | Hannah Jane Parkinson   Even President Obama, who just a week ago said Trump shouldnâ€™t have the nuclear codes, is trying to normalize his successor. Reject this. Anyone doing this is telling us to look past massive bigotry, Islamophobia, antisemitism and a culture of sexual predation. These people are not our friends. Resist their urge to make you complicit in your name. We must look closely at people who have claimed to be our political friends under false allegiances. As a gay man, I must take a hard look at the fact that Apple CEO Tim Cook, who hosted a fundraiser for Paul Ryan, and Peter Thiel, who destroyed Gawker in his war against a free press and who backed Trump, are now the two most powerful gay men in America. I have long been critical of â€œGay Incâ€, but it will now more actively be tied into systems of oppression against transgender people, Hispanics, Muslims, immigrants, Jews, black people and women. Gay rights will now likely fold into white male rights. These people are not our friends. Each of us also must know our own values, and what you are and are not willing to do in the name of normalization. Will you be silent if only rich women can access abortion (or no women can access it)? If the poor lose health coverage? If millions of Hispanic people are surveilled and their families broken apart?  What about if water and air standards vanish and lead to the kind of catastrophe faced by the people of Flint? If Giulianiâ€™s aggressive 1990â€™s New York stop-and-frisk policy is unleashed on the whole nation? Will you speak up? What laws will you break and not break? If youâ€™re white and/or a citizen, will you risk going to jail to stop the violent deportation of a neighbor? You have to take stock of these questions, and answer them for yourself, because the people who will tell you to be obedient and to not question authority are not our friends. We have seen what Trump and his ilk think of an American-born Hispanic judge, a free press and the Voting Rights Act. He has threatened to sue the New York Times and his political opponents. If the justice department is run by Giuliani, which is a possibility, it is unlikely that he will be too eager to investigate the reported rise in hate crimes in the past week. So have no faith in the coming government and no faith in any media which cozies up to this manâ€™s administration for access. Donâ€™t assume youâ€™ll be able to rely on social media to disseminate information as you have. Resist and accept that the world, and how it operates, is going to be fundamentally different.   Related: Dismantling the ACA would be catastrophic for people like my partner | Annamarya Scaccia   Finally, we must let go of the normalizing idea that we are going â€œto get through thisâ€. Many of us are not. If Trump has his way, some women (likely women of color) who canâ€™t afford safe abortions will die having illegal ones. Black Americans, who will likely be more policed, will risk being killed more often by cops. If Obamacare â€“ or Medicare, which Paul Ryan wants to make private â€“ is rolled back considerably, many will likely die without proper healthcare. All of this will disproportionately harm people of color. Not all of us are going to get out of this alive or unharmed. But we can resist, fight for each other, witness one another and love one another. Itâ€™s going to take a more radical notion of love than we commonly hold â€“ the kind of radical love Martin Luther King was jailed and died for expressing â€“ and it will require never accepting that any of this is normal.",1
"selfnews staff writer On Orchid Island, the latest greeting between hotel operators is 'Have you solar paneled yet? ' This is because more and more inns and hostels on the island have begun to install cost-saving and environmentally-friendly solar panel water heating systems, sparking a trend that environmentalists hope will spread across Taiwan. Located off Taiwan's southeast coast in the Pacific Ocean, the island famous for its aboriginal culture and picturesque scenery now has a higher percentage of hotels with solar panel hot-water systems than any other area in Taiwan. So far, 10 out of the 52 hotels and hostels there have installed solar water heaters. Hoteliers on the remote island never imagined they could help limit greenhouse gases, or save the planet. 'We don't have much here, except sunshine and the wind, which are endlessly available,' said Chen Tsung-yue, operator of Yueshiuan Hotel. Taking advantage of the strong and long durations of sunshine on the island, Chen was one of the first hotel owners to install a solar hot water system on his hostel's roof, at a cost of about NT$60,000 (US$2,000). 'I recouped the investment in just one year,' he said. Others on Orchid Island soon followed in his footsteps, and the trend is also catching on elsewhere in Taiwan. Central Taiwan's Nantou County has the greatest number of solar-powered water heaters in the country and the highest percentage of households with solar water heaters, mainly because almost all the homes rebuilt after the devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake were equipped with solar water heaters. Nationwide, 5 percent of all households have installed the devices, ranking Taiwan third behind Israel and Cyprus, according to the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Part of the reason for Taiwan's relatively high installation rate is that in 2000 the Bureau of Energy initiated a generous program offering incentives and subsidies to households to install solar water heaters, and 440,000 homes around the country have put in the devices since then. The 5 percent installation rate in Taiwan is equivalent to a savings of 5 million 20-kilogram containers of liquefied gas that are not consumed, or a reduction of 370,000 tons of carbon dioxide, according to Bureau chief Yeh Hui- ching. 'It is expected that there will be 20 percent coverage of all homes with water- heating solar panels by 2020, with subsidies rising by 50 percent from this year,' Yeh said. The subsidy now averages NT$10,800 for a heater capable of generating hot water for a family of 4-5 persons, or solar collectors of an area of 4.8 square meters, compared to NT$7,200 since 2000. Besides hotels and homes, some businesses in Taiwan are also joining the trend. The Fugi Educational Park located in south-central Yunlin County -- known for its exclusively Buddhist education of youths and its devotion to promoting organic diets and green life -- has been one of the major users of solar water heaters in Taiwan. According to Chuang Chao-chin, the head of Fugi's construction engineering task force, the institution has had 11 solar water heating systems installed so far since the school's inception in 2003 at a total cost of NT$13.75 million. 'The hot water has been limitlessly available in dormitories for about 1,000 students, faculty and volunteers, ' Chuang said. 'Even during peak shower hours in winter time, there was a sufficient supply of hot water without ever hitting a snag.' 'The investment in the installation was paid back in three years,' a contented Chuang said. The Bureau of Energy has encouraged the installation of solar water heaters in part because of geography. Taiwan's latitude -- between 22XN and 25XN -- is ideal for transforming the sun's rays into electricity and has made solar thermal energy the most widely used form of renewable energy in the country. The solar water heating industry has also matured, with every phase of the installation, from know-how to equipment and materials, developed and sourced locally, said K. C. Chang, a professor at National Cheng Kung University in the southern city of Tainan. But whether solar water heaters can become more popular and widely used in Taiwan depends on climate conditions, population structure, urbanization, building types and the status of new construction, according to Chang, who is also the principal investigator of NCKU's Research and Development Foundation, which has been authorized by the bureau to oversee the application of solar water heaters in the country. Chang and his investigative team found that solar water heating systems are popular in Taiwan's central and southwestern regions, mainly because sunshine duration there is longer, and there are many more individual bungalows or terraced houses with flat roofs in the regions than in northern Taiwan, which make installation easier. Solar water heaters have gained less traction in the north because of the many high-rise residential buildings and relatively lower sunshine duration. Taiwan's government has not done enough to promote the application of solar water heating systems on the island, said Chen Fu-yung, chairman of the Taiwan Solar Energy Development Association, a nonprofit group of solar water heater installers and dealers. Compared to Israel, in which installation of solar water heaters is mandatory, Germany, where installations grew at an 84 percent rate in 2008, and Spain, where the installation rate was up 67 percent last year, Taiwan has lagged far behind, Chen said. He said that during a national energy conference held in April, officials and specialists devoted a lot of time to the further expansion of wind power generation and the development of solar photovoltaic energy in Taiwan. It is unrealistic, however, to talk about developing wind power generation at present with each wind turbine unit having to be imported at a cost of NT$100 million. 'It would only benefit the foreign suppliers and dealers, ' he contended. 'Why doesn't the government pay greater attention to the solar water heating system sector, whose know-how is mature and related materials available domestically thanks to Taiwan's well-developed high-tech industries. Also, solar water heating systems are inexpensive compared with wind and photovoltalic energy, ' Chen noted. The administration should live up to its promise to have 140,000 more solar water heating systems installed nationwide in the next four years, Chen said. 'The installation plan should begin in public facilities, such as schools, prisons, fire departments, police stations, and military establishments -- places with vast spaces and flat roofs that are ideal for solar panels,' he suggested. To bolster the popularity of solar water heaters in northern Taiwan, particularly in the Taipei metropolitan area, the government will also need to develop new strategies. In eastern Taiwan, it needs to address the problem of typhoons, which can destroy the roof-top equipment, Chen added. ",1

"Startling Evidence That Central Banks And Wall Street Insiders Are Rapidly Preparing For Something BIGMichael Snyder, Contributor Right now, Wall Street insiders and central banks all around the globe are making some very unusual moves. In fact, they appear to be rapidly preparing for something really big. So exactly what are they up to? In a previous article entitled Are The Government And The Big Banks Quietly Preparing For An Imminent Financial Collapse?, I speculated that they may be preparing for a financial meltdown of some sort. As I noted in that article, more than 600 banking executives have resigned from their positions over the past 12 months, and I have been personally told that a substantial number of Wall Street bankers have been shopping for prepper properties this summer. But now even more evidence has emerged that quiet preparations are being made for an imminent financial collapse. That doesnt guarantee that something will happen or wont happen. Like any good detective, we are gathering clues and trying to figure out what the evidence is telling us. Why Is George Soros Selling So Much Stock And Buying So Much Gold? That is why it is very alarming that he has dumped all of his banking stocks and that he is massively hoarding gold. The following is from shtfplan.com. In a harbinger of what may be coming our way in the Fall of 2012, billionaire financier George Soros has sold all of his equity positions in major financial stocks according to a 13-F report filed with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30, 2012. Soros, who manages funds through various accounts in the US and the Cayman Islands, has reportedly unloaded over one million shares of stock in financial companies and banks that include Citigroup (420,000 shares), JP Morgan (701,400 shares) and Goldman Sachs (120,000 shares). The total value of the stock sales amounts to nearly $50 million. Whats equally as interesting as his sale of major financials is where Soros has shifted his money. At the same time he was selling bank stocks, he was acquiring some 884,000 shares (approx. $130 million) of Gold via the SPDR Gold Trust. Why would you dump over a million shares of stock in major banks and purchase more than 100 million dollars worth of gold? Well, it would make perfect sense if you believed that a collapse of the financial system was about to happen. Earlier this year, George Soros told the following to Newsweek. I am not here to cheer you up. The situation is about as serious and difficult as Ive experienced in my career, Soros tells Newsweek. We are facing an extremely difficult time, comparable in many ways to the 1930s, the Great Depression. We are facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world, which threatens to put us in a decade of more stagnation, or worse. The best-case scenario is a deflationary environment. The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system. It looks like he is putting his money where his mouth is. Perhaps even more disturbing is what he believes is coming after the financial collapse. As anger rises, riots on the streets of American cities are inevitable. Yes, yes, yes, he says, almost gleefully. The response to the unrest could be more damaging than the violence itself. It will be an excuse for cracking down and using strong-arm tactics to maintain law and order, which, carried to an extreme, could bring about a repressive political system, a society where individual liberty is much more constrained, which would be a break with the tradition of the United States. That doesnt sound good. George Soros has told us what he believes is going to happen, and now he is making moves with his money that indicate that he is convinced that it is actually about to start happening. But he is not the only one that has been busy accumulating gold. Billionaire John Paulson (the one that made 20 billion dollars on the subprime mortgage meltdown) has been buying gold like crazy and his company now has 44 percent of its $24 billion fund exposed to bullion. So why are Soros and Paulson buying up so much gold? Central Banks Are Also Hoarding Gold Prior to 2009, the central banks of the world had been net sellers of gold for about two decades. But now that has totally changed, and last quarter central banks stocked up on gold in quantities that we have not seen before. At 157.5 metric tons, gold buying among central banks came in at its highest quarterly level since the sector became a net buyer of the precious metal in the second quarter of 2009, data in the organizations quarterly Gold Demand Trends report show. So why have the central banks of the world become such gold bugs? Is there something they arent telling us? Rampant Insider Selling In my previous article, I linked to a CNN article from back in April. First quarter earnings have been decent, if not spectacular. And many corporate executives are issuing cautiously optimistic guidance for the rest of the year. But while insiders lips are saying one thing, their wallets are saying another. The level of insider selling among SP 500 (SPX) companies is the highest in nearly 10 years. That is not good. A lot of insiders appear to be getting out at the top of the market while the getting is still good. Other insiders appear to be bailing out before the bottom falls out from beneath them. Just check out what has been happening to Facebook stock. It hit another new record low on Thursday as insiders dumped stock. The following is from a CNN article. Facebooks life as a public company has been a nightmare from day one, and the pain continued on Thursday as some company insiders got their first chance to dump shares. Facebook stock hit a new intra-day low of $19.69 Thursday morning, and ended the day 6.3% lower at $19.87. Sadly, Facebook has now lost close to half of its value since the IPO. Will Facebook end up being the poster child for the irrational stock market bubble that we have seen over the past couple of years? Overall, retail investors have been very busy pulling money out of stocks in recent weeks. The following are the net inflows to equity funds over the past five weeks (in millions of dollars) according to ICI. 7/11/2012: -537 7/18/2012: 637 7/25/2012: -2,999 8/1/2012: -6,866 8/8/2012: -3,684 According to the figures above, more than 10 billion dollars has been pulled out of equity funds over the past two weeks alone. So does this mean anything?Maybe.Maybe not.But it is very interesting and it bears watching. Why Does The U.S. Government Need So Much Ammunition? This week, it was revealed that the Social Security Administration plans to buy 174,000 hollow point bullets which will be delivered to 41 different locations all over America.Now why in the world does the Social Security Administration need 174,000 bullets?And why do they need hollow point bullets? Those bullets are designed to cause as much damage to internal organs as possible. But of course this is only the latest in a series of very large purchases of ammunition by U.S. government agencies. The following is from a recent article by Paul Joseph Watson. Back in March, Homeland Security purchased 450 million rounds of .40-caliber hollow point bullets that are designed to expand upon entry and cause maximum organ damage, prompting questions as to why the DHS needed such a large amount of powerful bullets merely for training purposes. This was followed by another DHS solicitation asking for a further 750 million rounds of assorted bullets, including 357 mag rounds that are able to penetrate walls. Now why in the world would the government need over a billion rounds of ammunition? If it was the U.S. military I could understand this. You can burn through a whole lot of ammunition fighting wars. But this makes no sense unless they believe that big trouble is coming. Personally, I wouldnt blame them for getting prepared. Our economy continues to fall apart and there are signs of social decay everywhere around us. The American people are more frustrated and more angry than at any other time in modern history. This upcoming election is only going to cause Americans to become even more angry and even more divided. All it would take is just the right spark to cause this country to erupt. It could be the upcoming election. It could be the collapse of the financial system. Or it might be something else. But the conditions are definitely there for it to happen. Unfortunately, the American public is never told to prepare because authorities never want to panic the general population. We are always the last to know, and that stinks.So dont wait for someone to come on the television and announce that a crisis is happening.If you wait that long, it will be too late.Instead, open up your eyes and think for yourself.We all need to work hard to get prepared for the coming crisis while we still can. As you can see, Wall Street insiders, the U.S. government and the central banks of the world are busy getting prepared. Dont put your head in the sand. The warning signs are there and time is running out. You can support this information by voting on Reddit HERE linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0

Theyve already been paid the difference between the cost per bill (about 4 cents) and the face value, which is obscene. The 3% management fee compounding eternally is just adding insult to buggery. It is a sorry state of affairs when a treasonous witch like Yellen can say with out any fear that the Federal Reserve is above the President. Why isnt the FBI arresting her? Been a long time coming.

Fiat can never work under a small group of connected elite parasites setting monetary policy for their own benefit and funding nefarious agendas, black ops programs. If there was anything honest about the Federal Reserve system they would be audited regularly. Piling on this past week, Greenspan gave a talk that skirted over into the history of populism in politics in America to include William Jennings Bryan (circa ~1900 Jennings Bryan implored Democrats to fight the money trusts i.e. big banks and big corporations). Greenspan went on to say the US was facing grave political and economic danger from the crazies inferring the populists supporting sovereignty. Greenspan: Those serfs want to be in control of their own money supply, thats crazy! LOL The timing of Greenspans remarks coincided with the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Jordanian Prince Zeid Raad Zeid al-Hussein, releasing an angry condemnation of the rise of populism around the world. He lashed out at Trump, Farage, Le Pen, Orban, and esp. Wilders as demagogues. Al Hussein attempted to link populism with racism.

"WASHINGTON, DCResponding to recent polls suggesting that he has lost touch with the average American, President Bush vowed Monday to pay closer attention to the needs of non-presidents. Bush meets with four non-presidents in a Camden, NJ packaging plant. 'Perhaps, in the past, I've been somewhat lax in addressing the day-to-day problems of the nation's non-presidents,' Bush said during a White House press conference. 'Well, that's about to change. I hereby pledge to hear and heed the concerns of non-chief-executivesa group of people who are very valuable to our country, in their own way, even if it's not always readily apparent how.' Bush has charged his staff of 50 with the task of helping him learn more about the nation's many non-commanders-in-chief. 'From here on out, I will do my best to address the needs of this group of upstanding Americans who, I'm told, are part of a proud non-presidential tradition that stretches back hundreds of years in this country,' Bush said. 'To this end, I have appointed a blue-ribbon fact-finding committee to look into the issues of non-presidents and find out what their jets are named, how their staffs are performing, and how they're handling increased pressure from the media during this election year.' Of particular concern to Bush are the ways in which the sluggish economy is affecting the average non-head-of-state. He said he's curious to know how non-presidents are responding to the rising costs of television-campaign ads, whether their donations from special-interest groups have dropped in number, and how much money they are able to set aside for foreign invasions. 'I want to live in a country where all citizenspresidents or notcan pursue their own policy initiatives abroad, even if they suffer from a lack of funding,' Bush said. 'In addition, Americans shouldn't have to go without the crucial tax cuts they've promised their political supporters, just because there's a mounting federal deficit. We must find a way for every citizen to afford the fundamentals of daily life: an adequate entourage of Secret Service personnel, limousine rides to and from fundraisers, and the political leverage to send legislation through Congress.' Bush said he will reach out to non-presidents with great care in the coming monthsfinding out how their oil wells are doing, how the major-league sports teams they own are weathering the market, and which Ivy League secret societies they belong to. He said he will also carefully read any policy papers they've had their staffs draft recently and review any recent press announcements they've made or leaked. 'There is only one way to win over the hearts, minds, and votes of our nation's non-presidentsa group which, I've learned, is larger than I had previous reason to believeand that's to ask questions,' Bush said. 'Is security tight enough at their military retreats? Do they have adequate support from their friends in the private sector? Are the global petrochemical companies that back them doing a good job of adhering to government guidelines regarding their campaign contributions? Do they and their households have access to high-quality spin control? If not, I'd like to help non-presidents and their families get the help they need.' Bush said he's so committed to learning more about non-presidents that he has scheduled a fact-finding visit to the home of one such non-president next month. 'In June, I'll be visiting my parents in Texas to discuss these issues,' Bush said. 'As it turns out, my father is one of these non-presidents. I didn't realize that before, because people still call him 'Mr. President' wherever he goes, but as it happens, he's actually been a non-president for years.' 'It just goes to show that, when it comes to non-presidents, I still have a lot to learn,' Bush added. In closing, the president said he has great respect for the many hardworking non-presidents he sees on a daily basis, including those who serve his meals, schedule his phone calls, and carry his shoes. Added Bush: 'You know, some of my best friendsincluding [Secretary Of Defense] Donald Rumsfeld, [National Security Advisor] Condoleezza Rice, and [Vice-President] Dick Cheneyare non-presidents.' ",0
"The mother of Dylan Voller, the teenager shown hooded and bound on the ABCâ€™s Four Corners program, has said she fears for her sonâ€™s life while he remains in prison. Nineteen-year-old Voller featured prominently in the Four Corners investigation into abuse in juvenile detention, which sparked a royal commission into youth detention centres in the Northern Territory after it aired in early August. Footage showed the 18-year-old allegedly being assaulted over a number of years while incarcerated. He has been held in the adult prison just outside Darwin since turning 18. His parole application was rejected on 15 September, two weeks after the royal commission opened in Darwin. Public hearings will begin on Tuesday at the supreme court in Darwin.   Related: The story of the chair: how a brutal device was brought into Australia's youth jails   Joanne Voller told a public forum at the University of Sydney on Monday night that she feared Dylan would experience severe repercussions after giving evidence at the royal commission. â€œWhen the story first went to air, he was really relieved that the story was out and to see the people all over Australia do the rallies and everything, it gave him hope,â€ she said. â€œBut right now, the last few conversations Iâ€™ve had with him, to be honest â€“ heâ€™s really scared ... When he gives the royal commission evidence, he still has to go back to jail.â€ Joanne Voller said Dylan had been given a black eye since Four Corners was broadcast: â€œHe says he walked into a door, because he canâ€™t go into it any further.â€ She said she was worried he would not be able to speak freely to the royal commission for as long as he was held in prison and vulnerable to further abuse. â€œIâ€™m really fearful that Iâ€™m going to lose my son, to be honest. Is he going to be the next person who passes away in custody?â€ â€œThatâ€™s where my headâ€™s at. Iâ€™m really scared for my son.â€ Wearing T-shirts reading â€œFree Dylan Vollerâ€, Joanne and her daughter Kirra spoke often tearfully about Dylanâ€™s experiences in the justice system at the event, organised by the Students Support Aboriginal Communities group and Amnesty International. Joanne Voller said Dylan had been put in the care of the state at the age of 11 and expelled from school at 12. â€œTo me, that was pretty much the start of his bigger trouble.â€ She said Voller had learned â€œat a young ageâ€ to pit his family against his case workers, and said the latter had been powerless to stop him from leaving his care. â€œThey were not properly supervising him or knowing where he was or what he was doing and they tried to cut us and the rest of his family out of his life and blame him for what he was doing. But as parents, brothers, sisters, we were only trying to help him.â€ Voller was sentenced to a 20-month non-parole period in August 2014 at the age of 16 for attempted robbery, aggravated robbery and recklessly endangering serious harm in an ice-fuelled crime spree in Alice Springs. It was during the incarceration that followed, at the Don Dale youth detention centre, that he was held in restraints and a spit hood, footage of which was broadcast on Four Corners.   You tend to think the bad old days are gone, then all of a sudden there it is in front of your eyes again  Ken Canning, Murri activist    Kirra, Dylanâ€™s sister, said his treatment in incarceration contributed to his behaviour. â€œWhen youâ€™re told for six years that a person isnâ€™t a person, it sort of starts to sink in â€¦ After seeing all the footage, I can understand the person that he is and the things heâ€™s done.â€ But â€œthe things he was put through was worse than what he ever inflicted on anyone elseâ€, she added, to audible agreement from the gathered crowd of about 150 people. Ken Canning, a Murri activist, writer and poet who spent time in juvenile detention himself, said the footage broadcast on Four Corners was a â€œdisgusting shock and a disgraceâ€. â€œYou tend to think the bad old days are gone, then all of a sudden there it is in front of your eyes again â€“ and, in some instances, only worse. Iâ€™m 64 and, you know, I can see where this boyâ€™s life is at. Itâ€™s not a good place.â€ He said the fact that no staff at Don Dale had been disciplined for abuse that was filmed and broadcast was evidence that the royal commission was going to be â€œuselessâ€.   Related: Aboriginal deaths in custody: 25 years on, the vicious cycle remains   Lynda-June Coe, a teacher and activist with the Canberra Aboriginal Tent Embassy and a representative of Fighting in Solidarity Towards Treaties, agreed.  She â€œhad no faithâ€ in the royal commission after most of the recommendations from the investigation into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1987 had not been implemented. â€œI donâ€™t see any findings will change the way we are in this country.â€ Roxanne Moore, a human rights lawyer and campaigner in Amnesty Internationalâ€™s Indigenous Rights team, said Indigenous children were not born equal to those who were not Indigenous: â€œAnd we have to change that.â€ As she was speaking, Joanne Voller got up from the table at which the panel of speakers were sitting and left the room.  â€¢ A rally demanding the resignation of Nigel Scullion, the Indigenous affairs minister in the NT, and justice for Indigenous children in custody will be held outside the Sydney town hall at 6pm on Tuesday",1

"Some novels sing from the first line, with every word carrying the score to a searing climax, and Days Without End is such a book. It has the majestic inevitability of the best fiction, at once historical but also contemporary in its concerns.   He transforms the blood-red landscape into the embodiment of the American myth â€“ violent, transgressive, passionate   The story opens in 1851 Missouri with the laying out of the dead after battle, then settles into Thomas McNultyâ€™s tale of his early life with bosom buddy John Cole, through the Indian wars, the Lincoln presidency, and the tragedy of the civil war to the safe haven of Tennessee in the 1870s. McNulty is a Sligo-born Irish American. His story becomes Sebastian Barryâ€™s salute to the socio-cultural marriage between Ireland and the New World, expressed in prose that contrives to be both Irish and American, a remarkable sleight of hand. Barry is an acclaimed playwright. He knows how to put his audience on the hook, but heâ€™s more than just the dramatist of young menâ€™s lives. His inner ear is tuned to a frequency that makes music with every sentence. A lyrical novel is a risky proposition, butÂ he gives it breath in describing a very dark subject: how America came into its own on the frontier.   Related: Sebastian Barry: â€˜You get imprisoned in a kind of style, I could feel it leaning on meâ€™   The American west of McNultyâ€™s superb narration owes something to Twain, Whitman, Crane, and even Cormac McCarthy, but Barry is not content merely to pay homage to these masters. He transforms the blood-red landscape of middle America into the embodiment of the American myth â€“ violent, transgressive, passionate, timeless and a little bit mad â€“ a place that becomes both the subject of song and the song itself. You could say that this is a western, but like the best of the genre, its vision fuses old and new: warfare, homecoming, gender politics, coming of age and romance. Days Without End is at once an affecting love story, and a nostalgic celebration of a long life. McNulty is writing in old age, looking back over 50 years, â€œand wondering where the years wentâ€. There is nothing he needs to hold back. While he compiles his recollections, heâ€™s also celebrating his discreet passion for another man, Cole. Barryâ€™s achievement is to do this, in the first person, in a way thatâ€™s neither implausible nor mawkish.    A Union infantryman in uniform, carrying a large rifle and bayonet, during the American civil war. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images   Thereâ€™s contemporary politics, too. Below the waterline, the novelist also wants to explore the way in which the dispossessed Irish who settled out west visited upon the Native American all the cruelties they had suffered at the hands of the British. Another parallel: the driving of the Native American tribes into internal exile mirrors the fate of many Irish during the famine. Appropriately for a playwright, Barry begins with McNulty and Cole on stage, performing a cross-dressing routine for the miners of Daggsville. Both are just boys in search of some excitement and a living wage. Soon they enlist in the US army together and find themselves in a vicious war against the Sioux, in particular the ferocious chief, Caught-His-Horse-First. The boysâ€™ unit gets caught up in war crimes. The upshot of savage retribution on both sides is that Cole and McNulty acquire a native American â€œdaughterâ€ named Winona. Their strange life as a threesome on the prairie becomes the emotional heart of Days Without End. Barryâ€™s answer to those who might challenge its verisimilitude is simple: â€œI guess love laughs at history a little.â€ His account of the civil war is impressionistic and brilliantly executed. In the fog of war McNulty gets captured by some Confederate rebels. When he is freed, his past catches up with him and he faces execution for desertion. But his sentence is commuted and he gets hard labour, noting ironically that â€œin the time of the hunger in Sligo a lot of men did that work, to feed their familiesâ€. Barry has rarely written more affectingly than in these closing pages. When McNulty, released from all his sufferings, walks home, his route â€œsparkles with the beauty of woods and fieldsâ€ and he traverses â€œthe pleasing state of Missouri and Tennesseeâ€. Days Without End is pitch-perfect, the outstanding novel of the year so far. Days Without End is published by Faber & Faber (Â£17.99). Click here to buy it for Â£14.75 ",1
"With the official start of the holiday season just days away, Chicago retailerslike those across the U.S.are bracing for the coming onslaught of shoppers with an unprecedented stockup on shit. In anticipation of the hordes of shoppers the holiday season brings, area retailers are busy filling their shelves with shit 'You wouldn't believe how much shit we are selling,' said Amos Frawley, manager of a Chicago-area Wal-Mart store. 'Electric razors, Toy Story videos, novelty ties, football phones, Hickory Farms cheese-and-meat gift setsyou name it, they're buying it. We're packing every inch of shelf space with shit, and we still can't keep up with the demand.' Among the shit expected to reach new sales levels this year is Christmas-themed shit, such as shiny tree decorations and ceramic, hand-painted Santa figurines. Also expected to sell well are articles of clothing which light up at night, such as glow-in-the-dark Joe Boxer-brand boxer shorts and battery-operated Dearfoam slippers with special 'Nite-Lites' attached to the front. 'Novelty shit always seems to sell well,' said Elaine Maier, head apparel buyer for an area Marshall Field's department store. 'Then again, around this time of year, people will buy just about any shit they can get their hands on.' Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL, is getting into the spirit of the holidaysand of selling loads of shitby decorating its courtyard in a 'Wonderland of Shit' motif featuring Christmas-themed shit from all 172 of its stores. Actor Jeff Goldblum is slated to appear at the mall Friday to officially kick off the festivities by reciting his famous Jurassic Park line, 'That is one big pile of shit.' Though Christmas is still weeks away, the shopping has already hit a fever pitch. 'I got to the mall at 6 a.m. today, two hours before it even opened,' said Edgar Janks of DeKalb, IL. 'I want first crack at the shit. Nobody wants to get there after all the good shit's gone.' Said Chicago's Debra Tanner, who was at the mall Monday to buy a large amount of shit, including a cordless phone, a Charlotte Hornets NBA Starter jacket and a five-speed foot massager: 'I don't have nearly enough time to get the shit I need.' Lower prices are also expected to spur purchases of shit this year. Toys 'R' Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, is aggressively promoting its seasonal slogan, 'The shit you want at the best prices.' 'Not only is there more shit this year than ever before,' said noted economist Milton Friedenzohn, 'but what there is is far shittier. The Sanyo boom boxes being sold this year, for example, are even more likely to break than those from the previous year. And those new Panasonic WebTVs are just shit.' In addition to familiar retailers, shops specializing in seasonal shit are opening temporarily in hopes of capitalizing on the December craving for shit. 'Christmas Shit,' 'Wicks 'n' Shit,' and 'Bob's Shittery' are just a few of the stores offering customers nothing but shit. Even supermarkets are altering their inventories to meet the demand for shit, filling shelves with decorative snack tins featuring depictions of Santa Claus, which cost twice as much as comparable items that come in ordinary packaging. Also available are pfefferneuse cookies, egg nog and holiday Oreo cookies with red shit inside. Said Friedenzohn: 'There's going be a whole lot of shit under America's Christmas trees this year.'

"US Army Drills to Battle Political Dissent and Fight Crime in MegacitiesEric Blair The U.S. Army is now officially getting into the crime-fighting business. According to the Army Times, the Army is training to fight battles in megacities, not against other armies, but to help local authorities root out shadowy criminals, extremists and, wait for it, wait for it, influential political dissidents. TheArmy Timesreports on this years Unified Quest war games drill: And the service is convinced that these megacities of 20 million or more people will be the battleground of the future. Talk about expanding the role of the armed forces. The Army has been training in urban warfare for decades geared toward fighting insurgents and terrorists (those who commit violence). Thats why this announcement is so stunning. Look closely at the new definition of enemy: No mention of the word violence and it seems like theyre targeting political dissent. Indeed. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster confirms the Army is expanding these battlegrounds into other contested spaces like organized crime and politics. Of course they did get around to mentioning terrorists and insurgents to justify operating in cities. The emergence of unregulated cities, or zones of disadvantage where traditional rule of law models do not apply, within otherwise functional cities, provides a potential haven for organized crime, terrorists and insurgents, from which they can organize and launch operations, the Army report stated. If you give the Army a problem to solve they will come up with Army solutions. Heres some more meat from the article: Notable buzzwords: income disparity and politically dispossessed. McMaster said the Army took lessons from Israels siege of Gaza to use overwhelming force against civilian combatants. By 2030, the Army wants boots on the ground to have video and trigger access to predator drones and at their fingertips. It gets even creepier, they also tested directed energy weapons during this drill. Finally, the Army also got to test out some new toys presumably given to them by the NSA. In the drill, they used technology for anti-access techniques, conducting malware-like and electronic warfare attacks. This can be used for fun stuff like killing livestream feeds during police brutality, like they did in Ferguson. In many ways, Ferguson was a not just atest bed for many of these weaponsbut also to see how much the American people are willing to put up with under the right circumstances.These new Army drills clearly indicate that the authority of the state intends to confront politically disruptive Americans with military force. Claiming the U.S. government was using tax dollars to build a vast militarized police state to be used against peaceful civilians used to be a conspiracy theory a paranoid fantasy involving full-spectrum Big Brother surveillance and technology kill switches, tanks rolling through American cities, masked soldiers battering into homes looking for flowers or political activists, armed drones over U.S. cities, columns of battle-trained soldiers patrolling the streets, and indefinite detention of suspected evil doers. No reason to be paranoid. They are doing it for our safety. To protect us from those who may steal from us or threaten us with dangerous weapons, or from Peeping Toms who may spy on us, or from hackers who may steal our data, or from thugs who may kidnap us at gunpoint or, worse, murder us. Yes, thank goodness the authorities are protecting us from bad guys like that. Recently by Eric Blair: ",0
"Officer Goes on Dangerous In-Store Rampage...For a SquirrelAmanda Warren This incident which occurred in Mountain City, TN in late September involved former officer Jody Putnam who felt justified in using deadly force in a crowded store when confronted inside with a viciousand frighteningsquirrel. Property owner Carl Duffield had tried unsuccessfully to remove the frightened creature from the store and reached out to animal control, but that officer was out so Putnam, who had no animal control experience or common sense, was dispatched instead. Rather than find a humane trap, Putnam began immediately firing shots from his gun at the squirrel in the back of the crowded store. When that failed to killsomething, he wildly hosed the area with pepper spray. Duffield said: Shooting back there, of course that should not have been, that should not have happened. Then [he] began to spray it with mace and pepper spray. But the spray got on more than just the little squirrel: There was a lot of people that come out and just like me they came out and they were coughing and a hacking it was comicalbut Im sure they didnt feel that way, the customers that came out. One can only imagine the condition of the squirrel and its ultimate demise from being pepper sprayed to death. Some witnesses say they heard several of the shots fired in the store; others report they never heard them due to the scream of the squirrel. This officer was fired October 2nd for failing to write a discharge weapon report and refusing to report an explanation of his actions. His firing by the towns Board of Mayor and Alderman appears to surround simplepolicy, not the dangerous behavior in handling the situation. Strange that this incident results in firing, whereas officers who torment, run over or kill innocent people and pets are lauded for using justifiable force and at most receive paid administrative leave for the consequences. As long as they have that written report? Dollar General refuses to release the surveillance video. Cops and animals dont mix well. Not only do hundreds(at least) of pet dogs wind up unnecessarily dead at the hands of police each year; but attempts to rescue an animal are prevented so an officer can kill the animal in front of bystanders. Police in California have even taken to capturing injured (whats the definition of injured?) strays, holding them and placing them on stands for target practice. Yes that psychopathic behavior is really taking place. And do squirrels and police have some kind of heated history we dont know about? Because there seems to be some animosity from police towards these furry little critters. Back in April 2011, a police officer just outside a Texas college campus hosed a baby squirrel with pepper spray despite the cries of the surrounding students. It was said to be to protect the welfare of the students. One wonders about their welfare after clearly freaking out while witnessing his casual actions. No one who calls the cops for help really expects the trauma and damage that often takes place. For all the animal lovers out there, it might be a good idea to keep in touch with your local shelters, rescue units, and animal hospitals. They cannot always be there right away, because they arent heavily funded and use volunteer help. You might emphasize the importance of their taking calls so that animals dont end up killed this way shot at and maced to death. You might even volunteer your own services to help if an animal is scared or injured. It stands to reason that if an animal is loose inside an establishment, to remain calm and by golly, dont call police! Doors can remain open, customers can be alerted and some gentle help can get the animal out or just leave it the heck alone. If all else fails and an animal outreach isnt available, then call the Fire Department directly (not through 911); they are often made up of volunteers who are equipped to rescue animals. Law enforcement is simply that law (code, mandate) en-FORCE-ment. Call the cops for minor issues and you might be the one who gets hosed and left feeling like an animal killer.

"â€œPlease let us kill this giraffe,â€ a Ju/â€™hoansi tribesman entreats during a tour of the Kalahari desert in northern Namibia in â€œGhostland: The View of the Ju/â€™hoansi.â€ Young giraffes â€œhave very soft meat,â€ another tribe member enthuses.Since 1990, the Ju/â€™hoansi people, one of the worldâ€™s oldest indigenous cultures, have in a sense been unable to be themselves. They were hunter-gatherers until Namibia imposed a ban on killing such animals, severely disrupting their completely anti-modern way of life. Now they survive by entertaining tourists, selling handmade jewelry and so on.In this documentary, the German filmmaker Simon Stadler shows the Ju/â€™hoansi at work in Namibia. There are several ostensibly entertaining scenes, and some that speak to a viewerâ€™s senses of both befuddlement and outrage. In one, the Ju/â€™hoansi dance, half-naked, in the dining room of a resort hotel before an audience of pink, overfed European tourists; the kitchen staff members, also indigenous Africans, stand at their posts with their arms crossed, in silence. Their faces are unreadable.In the middle of the movie, a German anthropologist takes four Ju/â€™hoansi on a trip to Europe. They are awed and perplexed by what they see. On the observation deck of a Frankfurt skyscraper, one of them notes, â€œNow we are where the wind is living.â€This is an engaging movie depicting some sympathetic people, and is ultimately worthwhile. But thereâ€™s a one-dimensional quality to â€œGhostlandâ€; Mr. Stadlerâ€™s team obviously felt it was more important to record events than to explore conditions.",1
"The Reason Cracker Barrel Fired A 73 Year Old Vet Has Many Outraged According to recent reports, Joe Koblenzer, a 73-year-old Vietnam veteran was recently terminated from his job at a Florida Cracker Barrel, after he offered a corn muffin to man who appeared to be homeless. According to Koblenzer, the man entered the restaurant on one of his shifts and asked for mayonnaise and tartar sauce. He gave the man the condiments, and also offered him a corn muffin. He looked a little needy, Koblenzer told reporters, He said he was going to cook a fish. I got it for him. As I walked out I put a corn muffin in. Just a short while later, Koblenzer lost his job, and Cracker Barrel issued a statement about the incident. The company claims that Koblenzer was known for giving away free food. The statement reads: Mr. Koblenzer has worked as a host at Cracker Barrels Sarasota store since April 2011. During the time he was employed, he violated the Companys policies regarding consuming food without paying or giving away free food, on five separate occasions. Mr. Koblenzer received multiple counselings and written warnings reminding him about the companys policies and the consequences associated with violating them. On the fifth occasion, again per Company policy, Mr. Koblenzer was terminated. Still, the company is receiving backlash from the public, which can be viewed on their social media site. Some have even vowed to stop eating at the restaurant, claiming that it does not align with their values. Some are more neutral, claiming that they see both sides of the situation. What do you think of the situation? ",0
"It was Israel Folau who persuaded Ben Teâ€™o to take a chance in rugby union. The Wallaby full-back and Englandâ€™s latest international centre were sharing a flat in Sydneyâ€™s eastern suburbs when Teâ€™o asked for some advice on what he should do next. Without Folauâ€™s encouragement, his flatmate might never have switched codes let alone completed his improbable sporting journey from the village of Silverdale in New Zealandâ€™s north island to the home dressing room at Twickenham. The 29-year-old, who earned his first cap against South Africa as a late replacement, has certainly travelled a long, unconventional road to reach Englandâ€™s midfield. His mother is English but emigrated from Manor Park in east London to New Zealand in her teens. Her son played age-group union for North Harbour but ended up enjoying a decade-long career in the National Rugby League, playing for Wests Tigers, Brisbane Broncos and South Sydney Rabbitohs as well as Samoaâ€™s national team. He was a part of Southsâ€™ trophyâ€‘winning season in 2014 but had already found himself wondering if there was more to life than rugby league.   Related: Nathan Hughes says decision to swap Fiji for England was down to money   â€œIt was probably more to do with the fact I was living with Israel Folau at the time. I was at Souths and he was at the Waratahs and we were living in Kensington. Obviously my time in rugby league was fun but I was looking for something else. I was feeling a bit stale and asking myself some questions â€“ Would I have made it had I stayed in union? Would I have been a good player? â€“ which I bounced off him. I said: â€˜Iâ€™m 27, do you think itâ€™s too late?â€™ He said: â€˜No, no itâ€™s not too late.â€™ I asked if he thought I would be all right or would it be too hard? He was saying: â€˜No I think you can do it.â€™ He gave me a lot of confidence to give it a go.â€ Folauâ€™s instincts were to be proved correct, albeit after a shaky start when Teâ€™o broke an arm on his debut for Leinster having been persuaded to move to Ireland by another Australian, Matt Oâ€™Connor. He decided to persevere â€“ â€œI left the door open when I first came because I didnâ€™t know if I had left it too lateâ€ â€“ and was further encouraged by the vivid spectacles he witnessed at last yearâ€™s World Cup. â€œI watched every game and really enjoyed it as a spectator. There was no way I was going back then.â€ In a further twist of fate yet another Australian, Eddie Jones, took over as England head coach and encouraged him to relocate from Ireland to play in the Premiership with Worcester. Before he had even made his Warriors debut he found himself picked on Englandâ€™s summer tour back to Australia, the ultimate boomerang selection. A niggling injury ruled him out of Test consideration but Jones had seen enough. When it came to identifying a hard-running, strong inside-centre option as backup to Owen Farrell against the Springboks, Teâ€™o earned the nod.   Related: Eddie Jones to reshuffle backline for England Test against Fiji   This autumn is set to offer further opportunities to show he has adapted to the specific requirements of union: â€œState of Origin is warfare. It is very physical, it goes in a blur. I wouldnâ€™t have passed a lot in my league days.â€ Despite not having grown up in England there was always a part of him that fancied travelling. â€œWith my mum being British I always knew I had this passport. When the opportunity came to give this environment a go it was something I really wanted to do. I feel like Iâ€™m on a second career.â€ The next step will be to establish himself at Test level ahead of a clutch of younger rivals unimpressed at being leapfrogged by a southern hemisphere blow-in. Teâ€™o, though, is both a likeable sort and a hard worker; his travels have also taught him that growing up in New Zealand offers some advantages. â€œI think kids play with a lot more freedom at a young age in New Zealand and Australia. They get more of an opportunity to express themselves. From what Iâ€™ve seen in Ireland and over here sides can be very robotic at a young age. They are taught a lot about the setâ€‘piece and about how many guys should be in a ruck, whereas in New Zealand it is a lot more unstructured.â€ His words should be heeded by absolutely everyone connected with junior coaching in Britain and Ireland. Teâ€™o, in the meantime, is desperate to do his mum proud. â€œHopefully sheâ€™ll get over at some stage to watch me. I know sheâ€™s proud and Iâ€™m proud of myself as well. It is an achievement for me just to be here.â€",1

"At its shows in Europe and across the United States the 11-piece orchestra La Excelencia is often introduced to audiences as personifying 'salsa from New York.' So it is paradoxical that on its home turf the band's hard, tough sound and fondness for lyrics that address social issues has led traditionalists to regard the group as somehow outside the salsa mainstream. Rather than focus the spotlight on a nattily dressed and groomed lead singer, La Excelencia, which performs Friday at Lincoln Center as part of Midsummer Night Swing, operates as a collective. Instead of writing treacly love songs, as demanded by the salsa romantica style that has been dominant for nearly a quarter-century, the group sings about immigration, discrimination and poverty. In place of synthesizers and strings, La Excelencia emphasizes hard-driving brass and percussion, just like a Fania Records band from salsa's heyday in the 1970s. 'La Excelencia represents something very significant, a return not just to the classic formula of salsa but to the virtues of it,' said Aaron Levinson, a Grammy-winning producer best known for his work with the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. 'It's one thing to bring back the campana and make it sound old school. But that's not all they are doing. The really critical difference is that they are also going back to the more eclectic period when salsa was street music, playing with spirit and integrity and writing socially relevant music again.' The throwback eclecticism of La Excelencia, founded in 2005 by the percussionists Jose Vazquez Cofresi and Julian Silva, extends to its makeup. Band members, who range in age from 26 to 35, are of Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Colombian, Argentine-Ecuadorean and Japanese descent (with a solitary Anglo trumpet player originally from Florida) and know how to fuse styles without making it apparent. One of La Excelencia's signature songs, 'La Lucha,' or 'The Struggle,' blends Cuban danzon, Puerto Rican bomba and Colombian cumbia. 'It is important for us to feature everybody in the band, and that our songs be for all of Latin America,' said Vazquez, who plays conga. Silva, who plays timbales, added: 'That's why we call it salsa. It's a mixture of everybody's music. Why would you want to limit yourself?' Vazquez and Silva met as teenagers when both were part of a Roman Catholic youth delegation traveling to see Pope John Paul II during his 1993 visit to the United States. Vazquez, 34 and of Puerto Rican descent, was born in Biloxi, Miss., and grew up on the military bases in the South, where his father, an Air Force captain, was stationed. Silva, 32, was born in Cali, Colombia, but 'political and drug violence there,' he said, drove his family to immigrate to Baton Rouge, La., before he was 5. Both were members of Los Calientes del Son, a band that toured the South, playing 'everything from salsa and cumbia to rock, jazz and even country, just to be able to gig,' recalled Vazquez, who has an accounting degree and handles the band's business affairs. But in 2000 they moved to New York and quickly signed a deal to record a salsa CD, only to see that project shelved as the reggaeton boom accelerated, which led to a request, soon granted, to be released from their contract. 'We got tired of the kind of rules that were placed on us because we were salsa,' said Silva, who has a degree in psychology and has worked in cancer research at Mount Sinai Hospital. 'We had to wear uniforms for the cover picture. We had to have the pretty boy singers. They were telling us to write about this and not about that, to sing about love and not protest, to cut our hair, look sharp and sing to the women. Jose and I just got fed up with it, and so we told the record label: 'You know what? We're out, we're done, we don't want to be part of this.'' On its own Handle With Care label La Excelencia has released two CDs whose titles give a sense of the group's philosophy: 'Salsa con Conciencia,' which means salsa with 'awareness' or 'conscience,' and 'Mi Tumbao Social,' or 'My Social Drumbeat.' The band has also used YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and other social media extensively to promote its music. In addition the BBC has released a DVD of a performance in January at the Barbican in London, though that is still unavailable in the United States. 'One thing I like about this band is that you don't get the feeling they are in this to get rich or be the next big thing,' said the composer, producer and musicologist Ned Sublette. 'This is a fiesta popular. They seem to be about roots, about continuing the tradition and moving it forward, unlike the salsa lite that's on the radio. And I also like the fact they are a real working band with consistent membership, which is hard to do in New York.' Commercially, however, the path the band has chosen is an uphill one. La Excelencia's insistence on 'doing what we want the way we want it and not worrying about anything else,' as Silva puts it, has won the band a dedicated following but not huge acclaim or success. Neither CD has yet sold more than 15,000 copies, though they have flourished as digital downloads. 'As far as Latin radio in the U.S. is concerned, the market for what they do is practically nonexistent, extinct,' said Sergio George, the producer and arranger best known for his work with Marc Anthony and other salsa romantica artists. 'This is a band that for sure can succeed in festivals in Europe, because over there a great community supports that kind of thing. But in the U.S. it's tough sledding.' La Excelencia tries to compensate for that with a dynamic live show, meant to draw young listeners whose attitude, as Silva describes it, is likely to be: 'Salsa? That's my dad's music. My grandfather listened to that stuff.' On 'Unidad,' for instance, Vazquez takes his drum out into the audience, and the rest of the band follows. The older, more established generation of salsa musicians and promoters appears to have an ambivalent attitude about the group. Rafael Ithier, leader of El Gran Combo of Puerto Rico, perhaps the genre's most popular and respected working band, has emerged as a patron, going so far as to call publicly late last year for salsa fans 'to support the boys in La Excelencia.' But New York club owners often complain about the band's insistence on wearing sneakers and street clothes onstage, instead of the fancy shoes and suits that are almost obligatory. And members of some other local bands have been known to grumble that La Excelencia sounds 'too Colombian,' by which they mean that the group plays too fast for their taste and is too brassy, in the style of Grupo Niche. 'I really don't agree with that,' said Pablo Yglesias, author of 'The Rough Guide to Salsa' and other books. 'The truth is that La Excelencia is a mixture of the retro and the contemporary. I think they just see themselves as playing great music and not caring about fashion, so they are fresh that way.' ",1
"The Bruins agreed to terms Monday with 2005 second-round draft pick Petr Kalus, signing him to a three-year contract that NHL insiders predict will be just long enough for Kalus to evolve into an All-Star-caliber player before his inevitable trade to the perennial playoff contender Philadelphia Flyers. The Czech Republic native will follow former Bruin greats Sergei Samsonov and Joe Thornton in continuing the tradition of Boston players who were traded immediately before their breakout season. 'We look forward to obstructing Petr's development during his three frustrating years in Boston, although we certainly dread watching his much better career after he blossoms into the Flyers' top point scorer,' Bruins interim GM Jeff Gorton said. 'I wouldn't be surprised to see him score 30 goals in a season, many of them against us.' Over his three years in Boston, Kalus is expected to endure a brief stint in the minors, be called up by the cellar-dwelling Bruins, battle a series of avoidable minor injuries, get traded for two draft picks and a player to be named later to Philadelphia, and begin his run at being named MVP in 2009, 2010, and 2013.

"Marketing strategist Garrett Brooks, who reportedly cried himself to sleep Sunday while thinking about how much of his life hes wasted and how he continues to contribute nothing of any value to society, has some great ideas for growing his companys brand across multiple platforms, sources confirmed. If we can utilize Twitter and Facebook to integrate our brand with other established players, we stand to boost our profile in all the key demographics, said the 33-year-old Brooks, who last night lay in bed staring at the ceiling, tears dripping down his face as he realized the thing he puts so much effort into is so vacuous and void of meaning that his younger self would be disgusted by his pursuit of an occupation that ultimately doesnt need to exist. Fruit Stripe gum and Vans Shoes have already expressed interest, and the overall sense is that they get our unique voice. Now, if we can get the biggest fish on board, our visibility will shoot through the roof. Thats right, Im talking Burger King. And I have a contact there.

"Ten Year Study Finds Nearly 7,000 People Died in Texas Jails and Police CustodyBy Alek Hidell The study found that here were a total of 6,913 total deaths in the decade-long reporting period for the state of Texas alone. Statistically, eleven percent committed suicide, eight percent died from drugs, alcohol or other injury, and eight percent died from what was labeled justifiable homicide (justifiable homicide is a term utilized when an officer or guard kills an arrested subject). The remainder died from what police call natural causes. Of the cases reported, sixty eight percent were deaths in prison; sixteen percent were deaths that occurred while the arrest was being made; and sixteen percent died in county or municipal jail. In regards to race, deaths of whites constituted forty-two percent, blacks thirty percent and Latinos sixteen percent. Texas averaged over 623 deaths per day over the ten-year period. The number of in-custody deaths peaked in 2015, when there were 683 deaths. The number of pre-booking deaths meaning between the time the person is arrested and when they are checked into jail rose by 84%. In 2005 there were significantly less, coming in at 83. In 2015, pre-booking deaths rose to 153. One of the more shocking statistics coming out of this study is that approximately 1900 people died while in police or jail custody, who had not yet been convicted of a crime. The information was gathered through public information requests mainly from the Attorney Generals Office.The study was the result of cross referencing data from from police departments, hospitals and information from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The data collected, closely mirrors data released by the Justice Department in 2007. The DOJ conducted its own data analysis of inmates who died while in police custody, or in the pre-booking phase. The study showed that nationally between 2003 and 2005, more than 2,000 suspects died after being arrested, but before being admitted to the jail. Not only do the raw numbers closely match; the racial breakdown of suspects who died in custody also holds steady. The study found that of in-custody deaths, 44% were Caucasian, 32% were black and 20% were Hispanic. The close relationship between these figures paints a grim picture of the number of people who die while in police custody on a large scale. One concern over the statistics, is the misreporting of information resulting in bad data. Researchers believed that some of the deaths categorized as natural, may have been due to other causes that simply went under investigated. The study was lead by Amanda Woog of the Texas Justice Initiative, a research institute of the University of Texas at Austin. The Institute hopes to better understand who is dying in Texas jails, prisons and in police custody so as to find solutions and reduce the number of in-custody deaths.

"A handwritten copy of JK Rowlingâ€™s story collection The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which she made for the publisher who first accepted Harry Potter for publication, is set to fetch up to Â£500,000 when it is auctioned next month. Rowling handwrote and illustrated six copies of her collection of fairytales set in the Harry Potter universe, giving them as presents to â€œthose most closely connected to the Harry Potter booksâ€. A seventh copy, which Rowling made to raise money for her charity Lumos, was sold at auction by Sothebyâ€™s in 2007 for Â£1.95m.     More Potter ... a Sothebyâ€™s employee holds the â€˜exceptional and desirable objectâ€™ Photograph: Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty I   The manuscript, which Sothebyâ€™s will auction in London on 13 December with a guide price of between Â£300,000 and Â£500,000, was made for publisher Barry Cunningham, who signed up Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone for Bloomsbury. Cunningham was sent the manuscript of The Tales of Beedle the Bard on 12 December 2007 in a white Jiffy envelope. Inside was a cloth-wrapped, leather-bound manuscript covered in semi-precious stones and featuring a silver mounted skull. A note from Rowling in the front of the edition reads: â€œTo Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell â€¦ THANK YOU.â€ The Tales of Beedle the Bard play a crucial role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final novel in Rowlingâ€™s fantasy series. A copy is left to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, and contains clues used by the friends in their quest to destroy Voldemort. â€œThe personal resonance of this book makes this both an exceptional and highly desirable object to come to auction,â€ said Dr Philip W Errington, director of Sothebyâ€™s books and manuscripts department, â€œIt is particularly special as it is only one of six made for those closest to the author throughout the journey of creating the Harry Potter series, gifted to the man who recognised the brilliance of JK Rowlingâ€™s writing and her potential impact on childrenâ€™s literature.â€ Sothebyâ€™s said that the stones on the manuscriptâ€™s cover are rhodochrosite, which Rowling notes at the end of the volume are â€œtraditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily lifeâ€.",1
"First it was Samsungâ€™s Galaxy Note 7 smartphones catching fire and exploding, now it is the companyâ€™s washing machines blowing up. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has recalled 2.8m Samsung washing machines after the South Korean manufacturer received 733 reports of â€œexcessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassisâ€. On Good Morning America, Elliot Kaye, the chairman of the CPSC, described â€œa very serious hazard of the top of these washing machines completely blowing offâ€. Nine injuries have been reported, including a broken jaw, an injured shoulder, and other fall-related injuries. One woman reported a washer top flying off and hitting her in the back, causing her to â€œcollide into a cabinetâ€. All of which conjures up a domestic nightmare of marauding washing machines blowing their lids and attacking their owners.   Related: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 production permanently ended following battery explosions   But how dangerous is the washing machine? A 2015 Which? investigation found that fridges, washing machines and dishwashers caused 12,000 fires in the UK between 2011 and 2014. The washing machine was found to be the deadliest home appliance of all. The apex predator of the home, if you like. Based on government data, washing machines were responsible for 14% of fires caused by faulty appliances in the period investigated, with tumble dryers and dishwashers close behind. (Irons were the least dangerous, accounting for 1% of household fires.) All three appliances combine electricity and water. They are also the ones we tend to leave on overnight or when we leave the house. It is enough to make you go and hide under your hazardous electric blanket (cause of 2% of the fires). Are some brands safer than others? The Which? report states that in the UK â€œmore Hoover washing machines and Hotpoint dishwashers caught fire than we would necessarily expectâ€. Earlier this year, it warned that hundreds of UK households could be at risk from exploding washing machines after an investigation found 280 appliances, 115 of which were manufactured by Beko, were left with shattered doors after exploding. Experts said the problem was caused by coins, keys and childrenâ€™s toys hitting the glass at high speed and weakening it over time. Newer models with bigger doors and higher spin cycles were thought to be more prone to exploding. One of the biggest sins is probably one we all commit: overfilling the drum. In the US, Samsung has already faced lawsuits over its washing machines. In the highest-profile case, three consumers filed a suit against the company, alleging their washing machines exploded while in use and that Samsung has known about the problem for years. One of the plaintiffs, Melissa Thaxton, described her machine coming apart in its final spin cycle: â€œWithout warning, the washing machine just exploded. It sounded like a bomb went off in my ear.â€ In 2013, Samsung ordered a recall of around 150,000 washing machines in Australia, after rescue services reported a succession of house fires believed to be caused by the companyâ€™s appliances. As for the latest spate in North America, Samsung is offering to fix machines at no cost and a one-year guarantee, an exchange rebate, or a full refund for eligible customers.

"Le DÃ´me,  a nearly 900-square-foot suite in Le Cinq Codet in the heart of Paris, is named for its striking views of the golden DÃ´me des Invalides, under which Napoleon is entombed. But if that vista doesnâ€™t grab you, wander over to the other end of the private terrace, past a half-dozen deck chairs (all yours) and gaze at the Eiffel Tower. And should you grow tired of that, there is always the Jacuzzi, from which you can look out over the mansard rooftops of the Seventh Arrondissement and polish off the Champagne and chocolates that were left while you were out. Inside thereâ€™s a couch shaped like a croissant, a curved OLED television, two bathrooms, a dressing room and a tub ringed with white rose petals.As for the bill, it starts at about $2,000 a night. Donâ€™t raise an eyebrow. Le DÃ´me (or the â€œprestige suiteâ€ online) is one of the more affordable luxury suites to be found these days. Consider the new Imperial Suite at the St. Regis Dubai, which starts at about $20,500 a night. Or the Katara Suite at Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan, from around $22,000 a night. Or the more than 12,000-square-foot penthouse at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan, which can be yours for some $75,000 a night. That, incidentally, is about the amount of money researchers at Princeton said one needs to earn in a year to be maximally happy.Are such rooms worth the price?Some hotels are betting on it. Luxury spending among affluent households in the United States was predicted to spike by 6.6 percent over the past year, according to the 2015 Survey of Affluence and Wealth from Time Inc. and YouGov, a market research company. â€œSpending among one-percenters is at unprecedented levels,â€ the study said. Even millennial travelers are spending: 45 percent are willing to pay more for true luxury in lodging, according to the 2015 Portrait of American Travelers from MMGY Global, a travel and hospitality marketing firm. From the United States to Hong Kong, the most robust hotel sectors today are economy and luxury.â€œOur political and economical evolution are literally tied to the hotel industry,â€ said Parag Vohra, general manager of hotels for Sojern, a travel technology company. When the middle class was rising, so were middle-tier hotels. â€œNow as we hollow out in the middle,â€ he said, â€œyou effectively have lodging doing very well at the high end or bottom.â€For those seeking the former, thereâ€™s a new booking site for luxury suites. Suiteness.com, which is funded by investors, including Structure Capital and Keystone Capital, went live last year with more than 5,000 suites in 15 Las Vegas hotels. Since then it has added suites in Los Angeles, Miami and New York. London suites are coming. To use the site, you must sign up. A recent search for a room in Los Angeles turned up 163 suites with starting nightly rates between $316 and $25,000 â€” a vast range. And that brings us to a fundamental question: What constitutes a suite?Words like â€œsuiteâ€ and â€œluxuryâ€ mean different things in different cultures, places and contexts. Indeed, the word suite wasnâ€™t always associated with luxury. â€œIt was an upgrade,â€ Mr. Vohra said. â€œA more spacious product. But not luxury.â€The idea of luxury itself varies globally. In the West it generally means understated elegance (subdued colors, lots of daylight), said Mr. Vohra, whose hotel experience includes stints with Wyndham International and Marriott International. In Asian and Middle Eastern countries, he said, luxury is typically about opulence and service; having staff members tending to you in your room or escorting you to a restaurant, as they would at the Oberoi Udaivilas in Udaipur, India.In other words, a luxury suite is not just about the physical room; it carries alongside it prestige and a certain caliber of service. In March, for example, Rocco Forte Hotels announced a three-tier suites program. Guests of the highest level, the Forte Suites, are picked up at the airport and taken to their suite â€” which is filled with their favorite items such as flowers â€” for a private check-in. Among the first Forte Suites is the new Kipling Suite at Brownâ€™s Hotel in London, where rates start at $8,938 a night (including the value added tax).â€œLuxury has never been just about space,â€ Mr. Vohra said. â€œTo conflate luxury with space is to undermine luxury.â€This is why the word â€œsuiteâ€ is elastic. It might be six rooms or it might be one room. It might be 500 square feet or 9,000 square feet. There could be a terrace with sweeping vistas, or no outdoor space at all. The bill might run you $20,000 a night or $200 a night. Last year, the Hilton Chicago Oâ€™Hare Airport introduced 485-square-foot â€œfamily suitesâ€ â€” one room â€” starting at $134 a night. The Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, in Georgia last year renovated two of its suites and both start at $479. You would be wise to look at the particulars of the room before you book to ensure that your idea of a suite is the same as the hotelâ€™s.For many travelers, $479 a night is a splurge or downright impossible. For some, itâ€™s a steal, and infinitely less preferable than the Sterling Suite at the Langham, London â€” a penthouse with a piano, media lounge and a 24-hour personal butler â€” which starts at nearly $35,000 a night. However much youâ€™re considering plunking down, the question is: If youâ€™re going to pay up, whatâ€™s the payoff?Six years ago I wrote about how social scientists found that spending money on an experience, such as a vacation, makes people happier in the long run than spending money on objects like a watch or a piece of furniture. The logic is that humans are highly adaptable; we quickly become used to things, and with time they lose their allure. And as some researchers have pointed out, another person can have, say, the same watch as you, which makes yours less special.That doesnâ€™t happen with experiences. Experiences are unique. Even when they are shared, you interpret them in your own way. You own them forever. Indeed, researchers have found that reminiscing, reliving scenes that brought you joy, also boosts happiness.Which brings us back to the logic of spending big bucks for a luxurious suite. For instance, if you had a spare $5,000 or so, you could have a gathering in the GuestHouse at the Dream Downtown hotel in Manhattan, a 2,500-square-foot duplex penthouse suite with a terrace that was introduced last year. It has a fireplace, an outdoor shower and a glass-bottom Jacuzzi that can be seen from the suiteâ€™s living room below (consider yourself warned). A â€œvibes curatorâ€ can help create a party playlist or procure hors dâ€™oeuvres.Itâ€™s, well, ostentatious. Can such a thing translate to happiness?Iâ€™ve never spoken with a scholar who made an academic case for a $5,000 hotel room. But if youâ€™re thinking about a once-in-a-lifetime night, consider how different suites deliver different experiences.Sometimes, the experience you want most is the one that costs (slightly) less. Take the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, which has about three dozen suites. A recent search for a room with a terrace in May turned up a 750-square-foot â€œduplex Eiffel Tower view suiteâ€ for about $2,700 a night with no outdoor space. Also available was a 535-square-foot room (not a suite), known as a â€œterrace Eiffel Tower viewâ€ room, with a private terrace and views of the tower for about $1,500 a night â€” thatâ€™s more than $1,000 cheaper than the suite at a loss of a mere 215 square feet. Some people might miss those square feet. But if I had $1,500 to throw around, Iâ€™d take the regular room with the terrace.Obviously your dollars can be put to nobler use than a fancy hotel suite. But letâ€™s say youâ€™ve saved some money to have fun with. Perhaps you might consider splurging on a very special experience, be it a honeymoon, an anniversary or a 50th birthday party.I decided to tally the top moments, the experiences as social scientists would say, that resulted from my one-night stay in Le DÃ´me â€” not comforts or bragging rights but joys; ripples of happiness.They include: Looking across the street to see French friends huddling on their balcony, wine glasses in hand, laughing and talking as the sun began to disappear; seeing the Eiffel Tower twinkle in the dark as I wore a bathing suit, still damp from the Jacuzzi; truffles from Angelina at turn down; the glow of the DÃ´me des Invalides as the sun fought through rainclouds; and the ability, now and forever, to remember the time when I was lucky enough to spend a night in a magical aerie in Paris.",1
"Local man Scott Gentries told reporters Wednesday that his deliberately limited grasp of Islamic history and culture was still more than sufficient to shape his views of the entire Muslim world. Gentries, 48, said he had absolutely no interest in exposing himself to further knowledge of Islamic civilization or putting his sweeping opinions into a broader context of any kind, and confirmed he was 'perfectly happy' to make a handful of emotionally charged words the basis of his mistrust toward all members of the world's second-largest religion. 'I learned all that really matters about the Muslim faith on 9/11,' Gentries said in reference to the terrorist attacks on the United States undertaken by 19 of Islam's approximately 1.6 billion practitioners. 'What more do I need to know to stigmatize Muslims everywhere as inherently violent radicals?' 'And now they want to build a mosque at Ground Zero,' continued Gentries, eliminating any distinction between the 9/11 hijackers and Muslims in general. 'No, I won't examine the accuracy of that statement, but yes, I will allow myself to be outraged by it and use it as evidence of these people's universal callousness toward Americans who lost loved ones when the Twin Towers fell.' 'Even though I am not one of those people,' he added. When told that the proposed 'Ground Zero mosque' is actually a community center two blocks north of the site that would include, in addition to a public prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant, and athletic facilities, Gentries shook his head and said, 'I know all I'm going to let myself know.' Gentries explained that it 'didn't take long' to find out as much about the tenets of Islam as he needed to. He said he knew Muslims stoned their women for committing adultery, trained for terrorist attacks at fundamentalist madrassas, and believed in jihad, which Gentries described as the thing they used to justify killing infidels. 'All Muslims are at war with America, and I will resist any attempt to challenge that assertion with potentially illuminating facts,' said Gentries, who threatened to leave the room if presented with the number of Muslims who live peacefully in the United States, serve in the country's armed forces, or were victims themselves of the 9/11 attacks. 'Period.' 'If you don't believe me, wait until they put your wife in a burka,' Gentries continued in reference to the face-and-body-covering worn by a small minority of Muslim women and banned in the universities of Turkey, Tunisia, and Syria. 'Or worse, a rape camp. That's right: For reasons I am content being totally unable to articulate, I am choosing to associate Muslims with rape camps.' Over the past decade, Gentries said he has taken pains to avoid personal interactions or media that might have the potential to compromise his point of view. He told reporters that the closest he had come to confronting a contrary standpoint was tuning in to the first few seconds of an interview with a moderate Muslim cleric before hastily turning off the television. 'I almost gave in and listened to that guy defend Islam with words I didn't want to hear,' Gentries said. 'But then I remembered how much easier it is to live in a world of black-and-white in which I can assign the label of 'other' to someone and use him as a vessel for all my fears and insecurities.' Added Gentries, 'That really put things back into perspective.' ",0
"Dimwittedly refusing to let her offspring venture more than a few feet away from her, an idiot gazelle at the San Diego Zoo was reportedly still protective of her young Tuesday despite facing absolutely no predators.

"When you try to figure out how to solve the housing affordability problem in the worldâ€™s â€œsuperstar cities,â€ as I did in a recent magazine column, it quickly becomes clear that the market today has been heavily affected by absentee buyers: the global rich who, looking for a safe place to park their cash, are snapping up apartments, in many cases sight unseen.This phenomenon has made headlines in London, where politicians have accused so-called buy-to-leave investors of monopolizing homes that working Londoners could use. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York did not directly address the issue in his new affordable housing plan, but such ghost apartments have also been the subject of fury in New York, where my colleague Sam Roberts found in 2011 that 30 percent of the apartments on the Upper East Side were routinely uninhabited.Certainly, outside investors are welcomed by some people, notably Michael Bloomberg, who once as New Yorkâ€™s mayor hailed billionaires as a â€œgodsend.â€ But suppose a city wanted to restrict investors to ensure more apartments were available to actual residents. Would it be a good idea? What kind of policy might work?Taxes, maybe. Many cities already give property tax breaks to owner-occupants known as homestead exemptions. New York does not, but it has been phasing out a tax abatement for the nonresident owners of co-ops and condos. Owner-occupants receive an abatement because they are taxed at higher rates than the owners of one-, two- or three-family homes. Now, nonresident owners will no longer receive the abatement.But the problem is that wealthy buyers want apartments so badly that a small tax hit might not deter them (according to the cityâ€™s Department of Finance records, the exemption is worth only about $2,300 a year, on average, for those apartments with the highest assessed value, and about 60,000 apartment owners are no longer eligible). The New York luxury market, said Jonathan Miller of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, has not slowed down: â€œThereâ€™s no cause and effect thatâ€™s apparent. The demand has been overwhelming.â€In recent years, London has raised the â€œstamp duty,â€ a tax on real estate purchases, for more expensive properties, especially for homes bought by business entities. But the market hasnâ€™t cooled. According to Knight Frank, a global property consulting firm, more than half of all â€œprimeâ€ properties in London sold last year were purchased by foreign buyers (including resident foreigners). Next April, the chancellor has announced, nonresidents will no longer be exempt from capital gains tax when they sell a home.Driving out investors may also have the unintended effect of depressing new supply. Some developers have complained that investors who are willing to buy on spec are one of their few sources of capital. Thatâ€™s one reason, â€‹said Liam Baileyâ€‹, the director of residential research for Knight Frank, that there has been more construction in London â€” albeit luxury construction â€” than in other cities in Britain with similar housing shortages. Sydney limits foreign investors to newly built property for similar reasons.Strong demand does not mean investors cannot be daunted by higher taxes. In Singapore and Hong Kong, the government has tried to cool the market for second homes through increased stamp duties, higher down-payment requirements and other measures. As a result, Mr. Bailey said, the volume of luxury sales decreased by 40 percent, even though some developers slashed prices to make up the difference. This did not happen in Shanghai, though, where restrictions on families that wanted to buy a third home caused a spike in the divorce rate, so that each member of the couple could own two. But elsewhere in China, efforts to cool the housing market worked so well that some cities, fearful that the market would bottom out, received permission to relax them at their discretion.The goal of these policies is multifold: to curb speculators, protect buyers and keep housing affordable. But there is always the danger of unintended consequences, such as higher holding costs being passed on to renters, should the owner choose not to keep the apartment empty. One way to avoid that would be to give a tax benefit to all residents, which renters could then â€œsellâ€ to their landlords in exchange for reduced rent, said Randall Walsh, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. That way, apartments left empty would at least help fill the public coffers. â€œThen you could export a significant portion of your tax burden offshore, which may make sense â€” it depends on whose interest youâ€™re trying to protect,â€ Mr. Walsh said.This would be another way of taxing the benefit of what economists call monopoly rent, or the profit generated simply from owning something that is scarce, like land in Midtown Manhattan.â€œItâ€™s not distortionary to tax away a monopoly rent,â€ Mr. Walsh said, because itâ€™s pure profit. If you taxed away $10 million of a $20 million profit, the theory goes, the landowner would still build just as many apartments. Mayor de Blasioâ€™s plan to require developers to set aside units for affordable housing works on a similar principle. If developing is no longer as profitable, land will become less valuable (or be put to other uses).But the biggest problem, perhaps, with trying to tax away empty apartments is that an increase in supply no longer necessarily means that rents and prices will go down for people in need, because the market is more and more bifurcated into luxury and nonluxury units. If a Russian oligarch declines to buy the penthouse, it doesnâ€™t mean the butler will.",1

"The Fukushima Plant is Still Leaking Like a SieveBy Joshua Krause Japanese authorities are currently engaged in a truly Sisyphean task when it comes repairing the plant, as it seems like every time they manage to secure a leak, another one pops up somewhere else. This happens so often that its barely covered by the news anymore, as the world slowly accepts its radioactive future. TEPCO recently announced that they had discovered a small wet patch outside of a storage tank on May 1st. The 40 milliliter puddle is currently emitting 70 millisieverts per hour, and was found while staff were preparing to build a new frozen soil wall around the reactor. To put that in perspective, the average person is exposed to 3-6 millisieverts per year. This stuff is emitting several hundred thousand times more radiation than that. Fortunately, this is only giving off beta radiation, which is much easier to contain than gamma radiation. Theyve successfully stopped the spread of the leak with a few sandbags, but its emblematic of a much wider problem. The water that is being used to keep the reactors cool is highly radioactive, and has been leaking into the water table for some time now. Given the numerous leaks and structural problems the plant faces on a regular basis, it doesnt look like Fukushima will ever be secured in our lifetimes.

You can follow Joshuas reports at Facebook or on his personal Twitter. Joshuas website is Strange Danger. Where did I recently read that a sociology professor at the American University in Washington DC just published a lengthy study in which she examined over 2,000 US news articles and found an appalling lack of coverage of the Fukushima disaster. Either news downplayed or made light of the threat or did not cover it at all. I am not one who thinks Fukushima is an extinction level event (not yet anyways) but am also horrified with the vast criminality that the nuclear industry is getting away with. Richard Wilcox The Filth Estate: Spewing Fourth The professor could have just asked us, wed have at an nth of the price and in a fraction of the time correctly concluded that the lame urine stream media are bought and paid for shills of The Cabal, the only truth about them is that lying is their raison dtre. Oh one can think whatever one wants.Truth will eventually supervene.Fukusima isnt going away we can make the socialist go away, but we are cowards. Ruled by the most ignorant that has ever walked the planet. We should be very proud, but we are more stupid than cowardly..we are hopeless. GOD is watching. ",0
"Itâ€™s official. The north-south divide in Britain is now wider than at any time since the beginning of the industrial revolution â€“ wider than when Charles Dickens was writing about Victorian squalor, and wider than in the depression years of the 1930s, when George Orwell exposed the grinding poverty of northern England in The Road to Wigan Pier. Remarkable new evidence from aÂ study by the academic Philip McCann, The UK Regional-National Economic Problem, shows that while economic output per head, measured by gross value added, is near Â£43,000 a year in London â€“ and as high as Â£135,000 in inner west London â€“ almost half the UK population lives, in regions where output per head is below Â£22,325. Indeed the regional divide is so vast that, at Â£13,500 per person, economic output in Gwent, Wales, is a tenth that of one of the wealthiest part of London; and in the Tees and Welsh valleys it has now fallen below that of Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia. Of course, in both the north and south we are all better off than 100 years ago, but the divide in income, jobs and pay is increasing faster than ever. Average household incomes in Wales, Northern Ireland and the northern regions of England are around 60% of those in Greater London. Last year, when jobs rose by 277,000 in London they rose by only 1,000 in the north-west and fell by 40,000 in the north-east. In London 10% of workers are officially low paid. In the north the figure is 25%.   Nothing the chancellorâ€™s autumn statement can offer will be sufficient to bridge this divide   It was a revolt of the regions â€“ northern industrial towns hit by wave after wave of crushing global change â€“ that pushed the Brexit vote over the edge. Sadly, with the north more dependent on European trade â€“ 59% of the north-eastâ€™s goods exports go to the European Union against only 39% of Londonâ€™s â€“ the post-referendum optimism felt by northern leave voters will be short lived, as standards of living fall faster and even more jobs are lost in leave-voting areas. Nothing the chancellorâ€™s autumn statement can offer will be sufficient to bridge this divide. Historical gaps in infrastructure spending are set only to widen over the next few years: transport investment per head will be Â£1,900 a year in London between now and 2020 but less than Â£300 in the north-east. Three-quarters of Government and Research Council research and development spending is in the southern third of the country while the north-east receives only 7%. Even talk of a â€œnorthern powerhouseâ€ cannot obscure a cut in regional aid from Â£3.3bn a year in the first decade of the century to around Â£2bn in the second. All this leaves us with a United Kingdom that is united in name only. Britain now has the most extreme inter-regional inequalities of any country in western Europe, yet the biggest concentration of political power in a centre that is singularly ill equipped to narrow the divide. Quite simply, our London-centric constitution has failed to unlock the potential, unleash the enterprise, or even meet the needs and aspirations of, our northern regions. And this centralisation does not even meet the needs of London. While northern communities live with long-term unemployment, forced migration and in some cases depopulation, the capital city struggles with congestion, overheating, high house prices and poor housing supply â€“ challenges that a more balanced regional policy could address.    Londonâ€™s financial district. Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters   So we need to engage the regions and nations in a UKâ€“wide debate that is about much more than the terms of Brexit. For this reason, I advocate a Peopleâ€™s Constitutional Convention, modelled on the successful Scottish convention of 1989, which energised Scotland and built a consensus for progressive change. Such a gathering should start with everyday concerns â€“ how to create more jobs, raise living standards and improve services â€“ and ask what constitutional settlement can best meet our needs and aspirations. A peopleâ€™s convention could propose more power for the north and, in turn, encourage an outpouring of innovation, creativity and local decision-making in each region and nation. Such a convention could explore a more federal way for resolving the future role of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the UK. After last weekâ€™s Brexit court judgment, the regions and nations could unite and demand a better deal under article 50. Powers now held in Brussels â€“ from decisions concerning regional policy, agriculture and fisheries, to social and environmental protection â€“ should be repatriated not to Whitehall but to the regions and nations, giving them power over Â£2bn-Â£3bn of public spending.   Related: Brexit would widen the north-south divide as poorest areas stand to lose most | Peter Hetherington   There is no going back to pre-23 June Britain. What is open to us is a fresh and more expansive vision of Britain than the Tory Brexiteers could ever deliver, in which we view Britain not through the lens of London but as an association of four nations and many distinct regions, whose potential remains largely untapped, and which are at their best when local initiative is unlocked and the right balance is struck between the autonomy our communities desire and the co-operation we need. A new and different Britain â€“ empowered, confident and outward-looking â€“ is the answer to the harsher, shriller version of Brexit Britain on display at the Conservative conference. A party that questions the right of EU nationals to stay in Britain, then proposes employers single out the foreigners in their workforces, and ridicules any notion that we could think of ourselves as citizens of both Britain and the world, is not going to build the Britain our young people want. The Labour party should now ask the government to sponsor a convention. If ministers refuse â€“ as happened in Scotland in 1989 â€“ then Labour should invite the other political parties to join them. The convention should engage citizens outside the established political process and should rule out nothing â€“ from a written constitution on federal lines to an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions to replace the unelected House of Lords. Out of such a gathering can emerge a more tolerant, inclusive, equal and outward-looking Britain â€“ the best alternative to the Conservativesâ€™ hard-Brexit Britain. For an even bigger decision than what type of Brexit we want to end up with is what kind of nation we seek to become.",1
Its Time to End Policing for ProfitInstitute for Justice ,0
"In 2010, Sarah Glidden, a young American cartoonist, went on a two-month, Kickstarter-funded trip to Turkey, Iraq and Syria with two friends from a nonprofit journalism collective called the Seattle Globalist. The idea was that she would watch and listen as they reported on the ground: her next book, she hoped, would look at how such journalism works in a world in which many big media organisations, under threat both from free content elsewhere and the rapid disappearance of advertising revenue, find themselves increasingly reluctant to pay for expensive-to-produce foreign news. It wasnâ€™t an easy trip, but nor was it as difficult as people had told her it would be (one Israeli friend insisted that, as a Jewish woman, there was simply no way she should venture into the â€œaxis of evilâ€). The civil war in Syria had not yet begun and Damascus was then still safe and welcoming; in Sulaymaniyah, the city in northern Kurdish Iraq where she spent several weeks, her gleaming new hotel was full of tourists, even if they were mostly seeking respite from the fighting further south. Even so, every day brought a new challenge. Contacts had to be made overnight, rather than gathered slowly over a period of months, and government minders, at least in Syria, had to be fought off. Even as her friends hunted down compelling stories â€“ here was a group of refugees living in one of Saddamâ€™s former prisons; there was a supposedly innocent man whoâ€™d been deported from America after his name appeared in the 9/11 commission report â€“ they always had to keep one eye pragmatically, even ruthlessly, on what might go down well at home. Were they to end up not selling any stories at all, their trip would be little more than an expensive waste of time. Meanwhile, there was the issue of Dan Oâ€™Brien, the Iraq veteran (and now university student) theyâ€™d invited to come with them. The Globalist journalists, Sarah Stuteville and Alex Stonehill, hoped to make his return the subject of a feature. But would he ever open up about what it felt like to meet some of those on whose behalf he had supposedly fought and whose lives had since been so painfully disrupted? As the days ticked by, they feared he would not.    An extract from Sarah Gliddenâ€™s Rolling Blackouts: â€˜about as serious and careful as a comic can possibly beâ€™. Photograph: Sarah Glidden/Drawn & Quarterly   Six years later, these things, not to mention her own thoughts and feelings about them, form the intricate narrative of Gliddenâ€™s provocative new comic book. Part memoir, part ethical inquiry and part travelogue, Rolling Blackouts resembles the work of her great hero, Joe Sacco, the author of Palestine and Safe Area GoraÅ¾de, at least in the sense that it is about as serious and careful as a comic can possibly be. But it also has a gentleness that is all its own, perhaps because Glidden works mostly in soft watercolour, a medium that seems somehow to reflect her refusal to deal in certainties. Stories, as she writes in her introduction to Rolling Blackouts, are â€œhow we make sense of a chaotic worldâ€ and she wants those she tells to be gripping; clearly, her material has to be edited, refined. But that doesnâ€™t mean that she isnâ€™t aware of her responsibilities or that they donâ€™t weigh heavily with her. Just as a personâ€™s life is much more to them than a mere story, so true objectivity is all but impossible in narrative journalism. Comics are hugely labour intensive compared with many other forms of reporting and, yes, a tiny part of her worries that while she was busy drawing Rolling Blackouts, things changed almost beyond recognition in two of the three countries it depicts. But in the end, she also feels her book was built to last. â€œI think it stands up in its own right,â€ she says, down the line from her home in Seattle. â€œIt is very focused on refugees: on how difficult it is to get resettled, on how only 1% of them make it to a third country. So I hope people will be able to extrapolate, to think: well, if it was this way for Iraqis in Damascus who were registered with the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] and going through all the right official channels, think how much more difficult it must be for the Syrians now, when the centres are overflowing and the numbers are so vast. But in any case, itâ€™s still important to understand what the impact of the Iraq war has been. Itâ€™s too easy to move past Iraq and Afghanistan and focus only on Syria. Those people [the Iraqis] are still displaced and still in danger. The fact that the news cycle has moved on doesnâ€™t make their stories any less important.â€ Can comics take the reader to places other forms of journalism canâ€™t? She believes they can. â€œThere are drawbacks, one of them being issues of timeliness. But work like mine tries to make a connection between the reader and the person being interviewed by showing things like their body language, where they live and what they wear. Itâ€™s about these slower moments, in which you reveal who they are as people. Text can provide more information, but perhaps it puts more distance in there, too, and weâ€™re bombarded by horrific photographs to the point where weâ€™re desensitised. Drawings have a more human touch.â€ She tends to keep violent images out of her strips; sometimes, listening to a person looking back and telling their story in their own words is more powerful even than blood and rubble.    Glidden, the daughter of two doctors, studied painting at Boston University. â€œBut then 9/11 happened. I was only 21 and I started to be interested in journalism. My reaction to it, besides feeling a sense of horror, was that if a war was going to happen immediately, there must be more to the story than I knew. So I started reading everything. I was drawn to photojournalism. I think I wanted to be Tyler Hicks [the Pulitzer prize-winning New York Times staff photographer], but I was also very shy. I didnâ€™t have what it took to talk to people and take those kinds of pictures and nor did I have any training.â€ After college, she â€œblundered aroundâ€, wondering what she might do with her art, until she discovered graphic novels, at which point something clicked. â€œI read Maus [by Art Spiegelman] and Persepolis [by Marjane Satrapi] and they were formative. All my life, Iâ€™d known comics from Mad magazine or the newspapers; I hadnâ€™t realised they could be used to tell true, serious stories. I didnâ€™t have a father who survived the Holocaust [like Spiegelman] and I hadnâ€™t spent my childhood in Iran [like Satrapi], but I started experimenting with autobiographical comics and from there I began trying to think of a bigger project I could do. Thatâ€™s why I went on a Birthright Israel trip.â€ Being of a liberal persuasion, she knew she would find this experience challenging (Birthright Israel sponsors free trips to the country for young people of Jewish heritage) and that this sense of conflict would perhaps enable her to turn her travels into a long-form comic. And thatâ€™s exactly what happened. She drew a couple of chapters â€“ she was then paying her bills by working at a set production company â€“ and when an editor from the comics imprint Vertigo saw them, she was offered an advance to complete it. The result was the award-winning How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less. Was this brilliantly precise and sometimes withering book controversial in the US? â€œOh, I got a few hate mails,â€ she says with a laugh. â€œOne told me I should mind my own business and go back to my loser life. There are some people for whom any criticism of Israel is an offence; do that and youâ€™re a self-hating Jew. But actually, I was surprised. I thought there would be more and some of my biggest support came from the Jewish Reform community. I was more amazed by the push back I got from the left, who were indignant I hadnâ€™t gone to the West Bank.â€ This was a little unfair, given that she makes no secret in the book of her frustration that she failed to visit the occupied territories. â€œIt was a major regret, which is why I included it. I listened to the things people were telling me about how I would be in danger and I gave into fear. But you know, part of what I like about the book is that it is about confusion. Itâ€™s a document of me at that time.â€    Writing How to Understand Israel taught her many things, not least to check her recording equipment before leaving home. â€œAnd I should have asked questions of people who werenâ€™t part of our scheduled trip â€“ the Palestinians who worked in the cafes where we stayed, for instance. I could have just talked to them.â€ What about her drawing and writing? â€œI learned to give space to things, to reduce the amount of text. You need to give the reader a break from information; you need to pace things in the right way.â€ But if her comics have a domestic, even quotidian quality, this is deliberate: â€œOnce youâ€™re in a place, you see how similar it is to the world you know and I want to show that. The same lawn chairs that we have in America are all over the Middle East; the Chinese restaurant we ate in [in Sulaymaniyah] had exactly the same dumplings as at home.â€ Her next project, she thinks, will be closer to home. â€œThereâ€™s stuff going on here Iâ€™d like to cover. Iâ€™m so upset by the misconceptions people have about refugees, especially those coming to the US. We have Trump and equally dangerous politicians saying: we donâ€™t know who these people are, theyâ€™re not vetted, theyâ€™re terrorists. In fact, the opposite is true: they go through two years of interviews with different agencies.â€ Does it make her happy that comics such as hers are now taken seriously, the subject of glowing reviews in Newsweek and the New York Times? â€œYes and weâ€™ve come so far even in the last five years. There are so many comics for young people now â€“ people like Raina Telgemeier [author of the bestselling Sisters] have just exploded â€“ which means theyâ€™re going to grow up knowing about comics in a way that my generation didnâ€™t. But thereâ€™s still a long way to go. Itâ€™s easy to be in a bubble, to forget that most people havenâ€™t read any serious comics, that they see the word â€˜comicâ€™ and think: oh, funny. We need a new word.â€ She thinks for a moment. She doesnâ€™t write graphic novels, but even if she did, the term wouldnâ€™t quite fit: â€œMy mum says that sounds like something very violent. She thinks they should be called narratoons â€“ and you know, maybe one day, they will be.â€ Rolling Blackouts: Dispatches From Turkey, Syria and Iraq is published by Drawn & Quarterly (Â£16.99).

"MILWAUKEE â€” A Milwaukee police officer fatally shot a man in August just after the man had thrown his gun away and lay on the ground unarmed, the authorities said on Thursday as they charged the officer with homicide.The officer, Dominique Heaggan-Brown, 24, killed Sylville K. Smith, 23, seconds after Mr. Smith fled on foot after a traffic stop. The shooting set off two nights of rioting here.Police officials have said that Mr. Smith was carrying a stolen handgun with a large-capacity magazine, and that he pointed it at the officer before the officer fired. But the criminal complaint filed on Thursday gives a somewhat different picture, based on video recorded by body cameras worn by Officer Heaggan-Brown and his partner. That video has not been made public.In the video, Mr. Smith â€œturns his head and upper body toward the officers,â€ according to an investigatorâ€™s affidavit cited in the complaint. â€œHe then raises the gun upward while looking in the direction of the officers and throws the gun over the fence into the yard.â€As Mr. Smith was raising the gun, the complaint says, Officer Heaggan-Brown fired his own weapon, the bullet passed through Mr. Smithâ€™s arm and Mr. Smith fell on his back. â€œHeaggan-Brown is observed standing a short distance from Smith with his weapon pointed down at Smith when Heaggan-Brown discharges a second shot from his weapon,â€ the complaint says.Mr. Smith was hit in the chest.The Milwaukee County district attorneyâ€™s office charged Mr. Heaggan-Brown, who was fired in October, with first-degree reckless homicide, which is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. The case was investigated by the State Department of Justice.Several high-profile police shootings in Wisconsin have spurred protests in recent years, including the 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a black man who was shot 14 times by a white officer; the officer was dismissed, but not charged with a crime. Mr. Smith, who had an extensive arrest record, was black, as is Mr. Heaggan-Brown, but many residents viewed the shooting in the context of a history of excessive force by the Milwaukee police against black people.â€œWe appreciate that the district attorney has shown independence and sound judgment in prosecuting the officer who shot and killed Sylville,â€ Mr. Smithâ€™s family said in a statement released by their lawyer. â€œWe also appreciate that this is but the first step in holding that officer accountable, but a necessary step in bringing some measure of justice.â€Fred Royal, president of the Milwaukee chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., said it was â€œsurprisingâ€ but heartening that an officer had been charged in a fatal shooting here.â€œItâ€™s a beginning, I guess,â€ Mr. Royal said. â€œItâ€™s been a real frustration here that these types of charges have not been filed against officers in several incidents that have occurred.â€Mr. Royal also criticized the authorities for not releasing the body camera footage.â€œTo think that a community does not have the capacity to fully appreciate what they see on a video, in this day and age, is just egregious in my perspective,â€ Mr. Royal said.Mayor Tom Barrett said he also favored the release of the videos, which he said he has not seen. â€œI think itâ€™s important to note that the evidence that the district attorney based his decision on was primarily provided by the cameras, the body cameras that were worn by the Milwaukee police,â€ he said.Officer Heaggan-Brown was placed on desk duty after the shooting. In October, he was charged with sexual assault and other offenses unrelated to the shooting, and the Police Department fired him on Oct. 31.On paper, he had seemed like the ideal recruit for a department trying to build bridges to the communities it serves: a young African-American man, an aspiring rapper who graduated from a public high school on Milwaukeeâ€™s north side.But a number of questions have emerged about Mr. Heaggan-Brownâ€™s character, and whether the Police Department missed a pattern of troubling behavior. One rap video obtained by the local media appears to show Mr. Heaggan-Brown saying that he would â€œstart a riot like Baltimore.â€ Records also show that his probationary period as an officer was extended, though it was unclear why.David B. Owens, a lawyer for the Smith family, said in an interview on Thursday that he wanted more information.â€œIt raises real questions, like â€˜How could you hire a guy like this?â€™â€ he said. â€œAnd should there have been obvious red flags when the city of Milwaukee decided to hire him? Should he have been on a shorter leash given those red flags?â€Mr. Heaggan-Brownâ€™s lawyers, who said they had not seen the videos, declined to speak in detail about the charges. â€œReading the four corners of the criminal complaintâ€ said one of the lawyers, Steven R. Kohn, â€œit would certainly seem that there are arguments to be had about what happened here and whether a crime was committed.â€The president of the local police union did not respond to messages seeking comment.The New York Times requested Mr. Heaggan-Brownâ€™s personnel file more than six weeks ago, but the records have not yet been released. An officer said this week that the documents were not likely to be ready until after the holidays.Mr. Heaggan-Brown has been in jail since October, after he was charged with two counts of sexual assault, as well as hiring prostitutes and illegally recording nudity. In one incident, the night after he killed Mr. Smith, prosecutors said that he arranged to meet a man at a bar, where they watched television coverage of the rioting and drank heavily, and the officer â€œbragged about being able to do whateverâ€ he wanted â€œwithout repercussions.â€Later that night, the man said, Mr. Heaggan-Brown sexually assaulted him after getting him drunk. The next morning, according to prosecutors, Mr. Heaggan-Brown dropped the man off at a hospital and texted a superior officer that he had messed up â€œbig timeâ€ and needed â€œto handle this the most secret and right way possible.â€Mr. Owens said that the homicide charge was â€œa first major step at getting accountability.â€ He said Mr. Smithâ€™s family, which has declined interview requests, was continuing to grieve.",1

"RIO DE JANEIRO â€”  Violent clashes broke out on Friday between police officers and squatters here when the authorities dislodged thousands of families from a newly formed favela, or slum, in a complex of abandoned commercial buildings, focusing attention on the rising tension over surging rents and housing shortages.Just two months before Brazil is to host the World Cup soccer tournament in Rio de Janeiro and other cities, police officers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the squatters at a decaying property in the cityâ€™s gritty northern zone owned by Oi, one of the largest telecommunications companies in Brazil.The squatters fought back by pelting the police with rocks, tossing firebombs and setting buses and police vehicles on fire. Even when officers managed to assert control over the settlement after hours of clashes, the protesters turned to looting nearby banks and a supermarket.One of the squatters, Nicole Evangelista, 22, said she had put down stakes at the complex just days ago. In a stunning example of how favelas coalesce in Rio, thousands of people had moved to the site this month, coordinating their moves over social media, building wooden shacks and calling their community the Telerj Favela, a nod to the state phone company that used to own the property.â€œFive thousand people moved here because they wanted their own home,â€ said Ms. Evangelista, who is unemployed and came to the settlement from Mandela, another favela in Rio. â€œBut this morning police got here when I was still sleeping,â€ she said. â€œAn officer told me he was going to fill my head with bullets.â€No deaths were reported in the clashes, but as many as 20 people were injured, including several police officers, according to local media reports. Photographs on the G1 news website showed children suffering from tear gas inhalation. At least 26 people were detained by the police in connection with the clashes and subsequent looting.Fires from the clashes sent up billows of smoke that could be seen across Rio. Police units also made forays into Jacarezinho and Rato Molhado, two favelas adjacent to the newer squatter settlement, after protesters sought refuge in the mazes of cinder-block houses.â€œThe operation unfolded as it was planned,â€ Lt. Col. ClÃ¡udio Costa, a spokesman for Rio de Janeiroâ€™s military police, said in televised comments. â€œWe didnâ€™t have problems inside the property, just on the outskirts where there was confrontation.â€Still, the images of the clashes brought into sharp relief the discontent over rising costs of living in Rio as it experiences a frenetic investment surge ahead of the World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, which Rio will also host. Real estate prices and rents have climbed throughout the city, including in many slums, squeezing low-income residents.At the same time, the construction of affordable housing in Rio has lagged behind. Guilherme SimÃµes, 29, a housing activist working with the squatters, said the Telerj Favela had been occupied because it lay vacant for years. Pointing to the desperation of some of the squatters, he said, â€œThey moved more out of necessity than knowing it would work.â€",1

And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know.â€ Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does not want people feeling bad for her. â€œPeople think and talk about me like, â€˜oh Melania, oh poor Melania.â€™ Donâ€™t feel sorry for me, donâ€™t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.â€ In an interview with Fox Newsâ€™ Carl Cameron, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that while it would be â€œvery easyâ€ to apologize for recent sexual assault allegations made against him, â€œyou canâ€™t apologize for an event that never took place.â€ â€œFirst of all, they are all lies,â€ Trump said. â€œThey are made-up stories, they were fabricated. Whether they like Hillary or whether they just want to become a little bit famous or something. You take a look at the butler. The butler was supposed to be the witness, the butler was my witness. I mean it was 100%, that was a disgrace that they were able to say it. It would be very easy to apologize but you canâ€™t apologize for an event that never took place. These events never took place.â€ Jared Kushner, Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, has â€œinformally approached one of the media industryâ€™s top dealmakers about the prospect of setting up a Trump television network after the presidential election in Novemberâ€, the Financial Times reported:  Mr Kushner â€“ an increasingly influential figure in the billionaireâ€™s presidential campaign â€“ contacted Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder and chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank, within the past couple of months, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  Their conversation was brief and has not progressed since, the people said. Mr Bourkoff and Mr Kushner both declined to comment. The heat is on in Arizona. Clinton campaign manger Robby Mook summarized the state of the race as such: we think Hillary Clinton can win Arizona.The traditionally ruby red Republican state has only voted for the Democratic ticket once since the end of WWII, Bill Clinton in 1996. The campaign said it will spend $2 million in television, digital, and mail advertising there.  This is a state that would really foreclose the path for Donald Trump to win the White House,â€ Mook said of Arizona.  Donald Trump has released a rare video message on Twitter accusing the Department of Justice, the State Department and the FBI of â€œcolludingâ€ to make Democratic rival Hillary Clinton look good.

I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order. Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists. Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections. Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.      2.16am BST  Report: Apprentice staffer claims Donald Trump laughed about groping  A female staffer on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trumpâ€™s longrunning reality show, told The Daily Beast that actor Gary Busey sexually assaulted her on the set of the show - and that Trump laughed about the incident afterwards:  Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor â€œgrabbedâ€ one of their colleagues â€œfirmly between [the] legsâ€ during the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female stafferâ€™s hand on the crotch of his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the Apprentice crew.  Citing five on-staff sources, The Daily Beast reports that the alleged incident took place when the celebrity contestants were tasked with selling inventory at an art gallery, where the contestants had been drinking. â€œWe were smoking cigarettes outside, and Busey was standing next to me. And then at one point, he grabbed me firmly between my legs, and ran his hand up my stomach, and grabbed my breasts,â€ the staffer told The Daily Beast. â€œI didnâ€™t know what to do. So I made this joke that, â€˜Oh, Iâ€™ve never been sexually harassed by a celebrity before!â€™ Then he grabbed my hand and put it [over] his penis, and said, like, â€˜Iâ€™m just getting started, baby.â€™â€ The stafferâ€™s colleagues told The Daily Beast that Trump was made aware of the incident, responding that Busey needed to keep his hands to himself. â€œGary, did you do a bad thingâ€¦[and] got your hands where theyâ€™re not supposed to be,â€ a staff member recalled Trump as saying. Anoter said that Trump mockingly called Busey a â€œbad boy, a very bad boy.â€     1.57am BST  Donald Trump: 'You can't apologize for an event that never took place'  In an interview with Fox Newsâ€™ Carl Cameron, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that while it would be â€œvery easyâ€ to apologize for recent sexual assault allegations made against him, â€œyou canâ€™t apologize for an event that never took place.â€ â€œFirst of all, they are all lies,â€ Trump said. â€œThey are made-up stories, they were fabricated.

These events never took place.â€ â€œEvery one of those charges were false and they were lies,â€ he continued. â€œIt didnâ€™t even take place. I didnâ€™t see them. The woman on the airplane, 35 years ago, 30 years ago? I mean, you donâ€™t even believe that one. Okay? I donâ€™t know maybe youâ€™re very gullible, but you donâ€™t believe that one. We have a woman on the airplane 35 years ago? No. These were bogus charges. These were lies. These were fabrications. I like saying it.â€ â€œSomebody else would say letâ€™s focus on jobs, which I do, letâ€™s focus on ISIS, letâ€™s focus on the second amendment and judges of the Supreme Court justices. I agree with that, but I want the truth to come out.â€     1.43am BST   Are you a fan of Broadway?

They never called me,â€ she said, â€œand suddenly becomes I was here illegally, I was married before. I was, like, â€˜yeah, find the husband I was with before I was with my husband.â€™â€ â€œEvery story, itâ€™s a female! Itâ€™s a female reporter!â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s unacceptable.â€ â€œI know he respects women, but heâ€™s defending his, because they are lies,â€ Trump said, of her husbandâ€™s attacks on his accusersâ€™ looks and credibility. Despite siding with her husband during the controversies of the past two weeks, Trump indicated that she has cautioned their young son, Barron, from using similar language. â€œI let him have a normal childhood as possible - we talk a lot, a lot about the campaign. We talk about the language, because we donâ€™t allow the using that language,â€ Trump said. â€œI tell him that, there are consequences as well, and he needs to be careful of the langue he uses.â€ â€œIt was my decision not to be on the campaign trail,â€ Trump said. â€œI will be a parent to our boy, to our child.â€ While she stands back, Trump said, her husband is happy to be leading the charge. â€œHe will fight â€™til the end - and he will fight for the American people as he fight for himself.â€     1.18am BST  Melania Trump: 'Don't feel sorry for me'  Speaking to CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper in her first televised interview since the release of video that showed her husband bragging about sexually assaulting women, Melania Trump defended her husbandâ€™s â€œboy talkâ€ as having been â€œegged onâ€ by a television interviewer. â€œI said to my husband that, you know, the language was unappropriate,â€ Trump said. â€œItâ€™s not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know.â€    Melania Trump sits down with Anderson Cooper. Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters   Trump, breaking the traditional role of candidateâ€™s spouse as cheerleader-in-chief, has largely eschewed appearances on the campaign trail following speculation that her speech at the Republican National Convention in July plagiarized Michelle Obamaâ€™s 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention. This makes the Slovenian-born former modelâ€™s appearance with Cooper notable even if more than a dozen allegations of sexual impropriety had not been leveled against her husband over the past week. â€œEvery Friday something comes out,â€ Trump told Cooper, dismissing the controversies that have followed her husband since he announced his candidacy for the White House last June. â€œItâ€™s very hard, especially for him,â€ she continued, â€œbecause he did so many stuff in his life. He was on so many tapes, so many shows. And we knew that, that, you know, tapes will come out, people will want to go against him. But my husband is real, heâ€™s raw. He tells it like it is.â€ Asked about whether she views her husbandâ€™s behavior in the video as â€œlocker-roomâ€ stuff, as he has characterized it, Trump agreed. â€œItâ€™s kind of two teenage boys - actually, they should behave better,â€ Trump said. â€œI know how some men talk - thatâ€™s how I saw it.â€ No matter the subject matter, she continued, Trump does not view her husbandâ€™s remarks in the video as descriptive of sexual assault. â€œNo, thatâ€™s not a sexual assault,â€ Trump said. â€œHe didnâ€™t say he did it, and I see many many women coming to him and giving phone numbers, and want to work for him and inappropriate stuff from women. And they know heâ€™s married.â€ â€œEvery assault should be taken care of in court of law,â€ Trump said, but the accusations made in the media are â€œdamaging and itâ€™s unfair.â€ â€œI believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition,â€ Trump said. â€œThey donâ€™t have any facts and even the story that came out in People Magazine, the writer that she said that my husband took her to the room and start kissing her, she wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on Fifth Avenue and I said to her, Natasha, how come we donâ€™t see you anymore? I was never friend with her. Iâ€™d never recognize her.â€ â€œHow we could believe her? That never happened.â€ Despite the pressures of the campaign on her marriage, Trump said, she does not want people feeling bad for her. â€œPeople think and talk about me like, â€˜oh Melania, oh poor Melania.â€™ Donâ€™t feel sorry for me, donâ€™t feel sorry for me.

After several days of negotiations, the exit deal is done, and being announced nowâ€” Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) October 17, 2016  In a statement to Today Show staffers obtained by the Guardian, executive producer Noah Oppenheim wishes Bush well:  Dear colleagues, Billy Bush will be leaving the Today showâ€™s 9am hour, effective today. While he was a new member of the Today team, he was a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward.  Bush, for his part, expressed gratitude for â€œconversationsâ€ heâ€™s had with female family members in the wake of the videoâ€™s release. The 2005 video showed Bush joking with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about sexually assaulting women.  I am deeply grateful for the conversations Iâ€™ve had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues. I look forward to what lies ahead.  At various points in the video, Bush - a cousin of former president George W. Bush and onetime presidential candidate Jeb Bush - laughed along at Trumpâ€™s boastings. When apparently spotting actor Arianne Zucker outside the bus, who is wearing a purple dress, Bush said: â€œSheesh, your girlâ€™s hot as shit in the purple. Yes, the Donald has scored. Whoa, my man!â€ Later in the clip, Bush jokingly asked Zucker to â€œchoose between me and the Donaldâ€, and adds: â€œOof, get out of the way, honey. Oh, thatâ€™s good legs. Go ahead.â€     Donald Trumpâ€™s sex boasts: â€˜When you are a star they let you do anythingâ€™   Updated at 12.23am BST    11.10pm BST   Tom Brady clammed up last week when asked to comment on the genital-grabbing talk of his good friend Donald Trump, but on Monday he explained why he acted so evasively: because he didnâ€™t want to be a distraction to his team. Last week, in the wake of Trumpâ€™s unpleasant boast that he could â€œgrab women by the pussyâ€ without their consent because he was so famous, Brady was asked by a reporter at Patriots media day: â€œTom, you have kids of your own â€¦ how would respond if your kids heard Donald Trumpâ€™s version of locker-room talk?â€    Tom Brady. Photograph: Greg M. Cooper/USA Today Sports   Brady didnâ€™t answer the question, and after a brief thank you, hurriedly left the stage. His non-answer provoked much ire, especially since many other athletes were quick to criticise Trumpâ€™s remarks. Brady, who threw for 376 yards and three touchdowns in New Englandâ€™s 35-17 win over the Bengals on Sunday, told Boston sports radio WEEI that he ducked the question because didnâ€™t want to create extra headlines. He said: â€œItâ€™s just the way it is right now. Obviously thereâ€™s a lot of headlines to make, and Iâ€™ve tried not to make a lot of headlines. Iâ€™ve been in an organization where weâ€™re taught to say very little, we have respect for our opponents and we donâ€™t do the trash-talking. â€œThe thing Iâ€™ve always thought is I donâ€™t want to be a distraction for the team. Thatâ€™s what my goal is. Not that there are things Iâ€™ve said and done that havenâ€™t been, but you try not to be. Itâ€™s just hard enough to win and prepare without the distractions so when you start having the distractions itâ€™s even harder to prepare.â€ However, Bradyâ€™s refusal to answer the question arguably created just as much of distraction for the Patriots, a point which was acknowledged by former New England receiver Troy Brown on Sunday. Brown said: â€œ[He should have said] just something, a quick answer on the question to get it out of the way, just answer the question to say, â€˜I donâ€™t condone itâ€™ and then walk off the stage. The optics of it werenâ€™t great. I understood what he was trying to do. But the next time heâ€™s asked that question, then give a quick answer and let it be. Iâ€™m not responsible for what comes out of my friendâ€™s mouth. But I am responsible for correcting my friend.â€ Today, Brady again said that he and Trump have been friends for 15 years, and that â€œIâ€™ve always had a good time with himâ€.

This is one of the big-breaking stories of our time, in my opinion - this shows corruption at the highest level, and we canâ€™t let it happen as American citizens.â€ â€œSo letâ€™s see how the press covers it,â€ he continued. â€œThe press likes not to cover it because the best thing that Hillary Clinton has going is the media.

So all I can say is, letâ€™s hope that our country gets a fair shake. This is a big mess.

We hope this situation changes, and that we are both willing to move forward together in the future. Today it is clear to us that our values are not aligned,â€ Pao continued.

"The upheaval in Syria unfolded fast. It left Abd al-Rahmanâ€™s entire family dead. He abandoned his home in Damascus, which had become a slaughterhouse, and fled across the north African desert in search of refuge. At barely 20 he was his familyâ€™s sole survivor. His mother was a Berber from the Maghreb, and his father was a â€œdesert Arabâ€ â€“ a descendant of the prophet Muhammadâ€™s companions, who had established the Umayyad dynasty. Abd al-Rahmanâ€™s flight as an orphan refugee took place in the year 750, when the Umayyadâ€™s rivals, the Abbasids, had taken power in Syria and were liquidating all Umayyad influences. He was lucky to escape.   Related: Nelofer Pazira: Heartbroken of Kandahar   Five years later he finally crossed the Mediterranean to a place the Romans had called â€œHispaniaâ€ or â€œIberiaâ€. In Spain the young man found his Berber and Syrian kin, and with their support in AD756 he established himself as governor of the frontier state of CÃ³rdoba. A political refugee, Abd al-Rahman founded the great European caliphate of al-Andalus. The Christians of CÃ³rdoba embraced every aspect of Arabic style, from philosophy to mosque architecture. The Jewish community thrived, and several of its members reached high political positions within the government. Through the lands Abd al-Rahman had crossed, he carried his familyâ€™s history and that of his country. Once settled, he experienced the inclination that most first-generation refugees recognise â€“ the dream to return home. But he could never return.    An Afghan refugee family enters Pakistan after fleeing Kandahar, the stronghold of Afghanistanâ€™s ruling Taliban militia, in September 2001. Photograph: Banaras Khan/EPA   So he settled for the second-best option: to recreate a version of his old home in the new one. Abd al-Rahmanâ€™s new Andalusian estate was a replica of the one in Syria. He turned to poetry â€“ another Arab practice from pre-Islamic times. He wrote an ode to a palm tree in his garden in Cordoba: How like me you are, far away and in exile; in long separation from family and friends. You have sprung from soil in which you are a stranger; and I, like you, am far from home. In 1991 â€“ unaware of exile literature and barely capable of reading and writing in English â€“ I wrote in my diary: â€œThere are people all around me; curious faces talking. They want to hear me speak. I, in my language; they, in theirs! The sound of my prose, alien in their books, speaks of the strangeness of all I see. They listen and nod, without understanding. The dialect of my past negates their articulation of everything present.â€ At the time, we were the only Afghan family in the Canadian maritime province of New Brunswick. Host families, classmates and new neighbours in the city of Moncton took a great interest in welcoming us, but it all seemed unreal. People living for generations in stability and relative prosperity could know precious little about what used to be our life â€“ sleeping amid the sound of rockets and Stinger missiles and the fear of death in our Afghan streets. For me, at the time, poetry was not an escape from reality; it was a link between the past and present. The familiar rhythm and sound of my motherâ€™s tongue eased the pain of separation; language became one way of keeping in direct contact with that past and the memories of the world I had left behind. We had fled Kabul in 1989, aware of the risks in making the journey on foot through the villages and mountains of Afghanistan. Fear of death was at every step, but it was the hope of a life in front of us that kept us walking. When living conditions become unbearable and when dying is what is left of life â€“ as it is for Syrians, Libyans, Iraqis, Afghans and so many others who are on the move today â€“ then taking the risk to walk, to swim, to get on a boat, even knowing itâ€™s not seaworthy, seems less dangerous. At least there is a chance to survive and reach a place of safety. As horrifying as the hardship and danger involved in this voyage to a new life may be, from a refugeeâ€™s perspective the inner journey of realisation of the loss of oneâ€™s home is almost as difficult and painful. The perils of the physical journey are visible, but the inner turmoil of loss is hard to express. A few words â€“ â€œexileâ€, â€œrefugeeâ€, â€œmigrantâ€ â€“ are supposed to symbolise a whole range of experiences. When we gave up our home, left relatives and friends behind and took to the road to reach Pakistan, so many psychological borders had already been crossed. When today I see columns of people leaving homes, towns and cities, I hear the demand that these refugees respect the westâ€™s geographical borders. What this fails to understand is that those borders have already been crossed in the refugeeâ€™s mind. By the time the refugee reaches a frontier, national boundaries have already become irrelevant â€“ except in the form of another obstacle to overcome. What is the power of a barbed-wire fence or a concrete wall in the face of all the risks taken to find peace and safety? For the refugee, the feeling of loss is not just about physical place; it is about the shift in oneâ€™s sense of identity. Turning from an individual with a recognised name and address, family ties and community connections, into a category â€“ the â€œrefugeeâ€, the â€œmigrantâ€ â€“ is unsettling. You start to feel a stranger to yourself. And in order not to lose a grip on oneâ€™s identity, the refugee begins to hold on to memories, as painful as they may be, or to tangible things: items of clothing, pictures, from â€œback homeâ€.    â€˜When dying is what is left of life, ttaking the risk to walk, to swim, to get on a boat, even knowing itâ€™s not seaworthy, seems less dangerous.â€™ Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images   My father carried a suit all the way from Kabul to Moncton, via Pakistan. It hung in his closet in Canada, neatly covered by clear plastic sheets. He didnâ€™t wear it, but he still put it on or often held the suit in front of him just to see himself in the mirror. â€œI look the same,â€ he used to say. He could no longer practice medicine â€“ in Afghanistan, he was a proud pediatrician â€“ but each time he looked at his image in that simple suit, it became a marker of his existence, his education, his dignity. Unlike Abd al-Rahman, my father did go back to his house after the fall of the Taliban government in Kabul. But after six weeks he quietly abandoned the thought of living and working in Afghanistan again. The world heâ€™d returned to was now even more alien to him than the â€œstrangeâ€ one he had come to experience in Canada. The brutality of the civil war had defaced Kabul, and the curtain of darkness the Taliban had left behind was too much to bear. A man who had tried to remain the same through the years of exile, protecting and preserving what was considered Afghan, was now shocked by the changes in his native home. When I went back to Kabul after 13 years and found the city of my childhood shattered and destroyed, populated by men with guns and women shrouded in burqas, I felt uneasy; not just because they were troubling things to see, but because of the pain of not being able to understand it. It was then that I realised what displacement meant: an abiding anguish, a feeling of eternal dissolution and non-belonging. Displacement is a horrible experience. Once you have been uprooted, it is difficult to find that place of inclusion or acceptance. The degradation one suffers is often silent. Itâ€™s justified on the basis of desperation, and tolerated because of the hope that displacement is temporary. For the hundreds of thousands of last yearâ€™s refugees into Europe â€“ most rotting away in centres â€“ hope diminishes faster. My cousins â€“ three young men in their early 20s â€“ finished high school in Kabul. Lack of hope for their future and increased insecurity, and the return of the Taliban, forced them to flee to Turkey, survive a boat journey into Greece, and walk with the cortege of the displaced across a number of European borders, dependent on the mercy of strangers who gave them water and food. They finally arrived in Germany last autumn. Now in a refugee camp they fill their days with waiting, posting selfies on social media, and memories of their sad lives; they too speak of fear, questions and forebodings. Most refugees today are fully aware of the economic problems facing Europe and America. But what the west used to represent was respect for humanity and justice, value for human life and dignity. The so-called refugee crisis of the past year has changed that, exposing an uglier face. In the loud nationalistic chatter and the almost unspoken rejection of Muslims landing in Europe, the main concern of political leaders has been either the protection of their parties, their own positions, or Europeâ€™s â€œChristianâ€ identity and its economic interests.   When I went back to Kabul and found the city of my childhood shattered, I realised what displacement meant   My father still has his suit: before he used to lament the loss of his old life, now he is in mourning for all humans who are forced to flee their homes. At home in Ottawa, he watches the news, his own compatriots made refugees again and again over three generations; he sees the plundering of Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen â€“ and says he has no words to describe how it feels for him, as a refugee. He doesnâ€™t take his suit out any more. In the wisdom of his late 70s, the symbolism of that garment has lost its importance, but the significance of his identity as a refugee has become more relevant. â€œWe were lucky to escape when we did,â€ he tells me. â€œPeople were more open-minded, Muslims werenâ€™t terrorists, and we were fortunate to come to Canada.â€ His gratitude shames me, a western-educated woman. I wanted to be part of a better world, one that could inspire another al-Andalus â€“ where people of diverse faiths, cultures and histories could live as one community in justice and equality. But Iâ€™m struggling these days to fight to protect a recent past that allowed me to do what I do now â€“ because I see it is dissipating fast into dogmatism and prejudice, where the translation of â€œnever againâ€ has been lost to intolerance, fear and insecurity. â€¢ A longer version of this article will appear in the December issue of the Dutch journal Nexus",1
"SAN FRANCISCO â€” To paraphrase Isaac Newtonâ€™s third law of motion, what goes up must, inevitably, come down. Now try telling that to Facebook.The social network on Wednesday reached the latest milestones in its quest to dominate the world, topping 1.79 billion monthly visitors as of the end of September, up 16 percent from a year ago. Facebook also added a record number of new daily users and said for the first time that more than one billion people regularly used its network exclusively on their mobile device every month.And those numbers do not even include Facebookâ€™s other properties, such as the photo-sharing service Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.Facebookâ€™s user growth defies the usual trajectories for social media companies, which often start strong out of the gate and then sharply slow down. Twitter, which added four million new visitors last quarter, now serves a user base roughly one-sixth the size of Facebookâ€™s. Snapchat, while popular among young users, has about 150 million daily users, about half as many as Twitter.That gives Facebook the major advantage of a giant and still fast-growing audience, an edge that Sheryl K. Sandberg, the companyâ€™s chief operating officer, acknowledged in an interview.â€œWeâ€™re really pleased at the strong growth of the Facebook community,â€ Ms. Sandberg said. â€œThatâ€™s pretty exciting to us.â€The companyâ€™s strength in users, which is a major draw to advertisers, also fed Facebookâ€™s financial performance. The company said on Wednesday that sales totaled $6.82 billion for the third quarter, up 59 percent from a year ago. Mobile advertising revenue was particularly strong, accounting for 84 percent of all ad sales. Total profit was $2.38 billion, nearly three times as much as a year ago.Even so, investors were spooked by Facebookâ€™s warning of a likely slowdown in revenue growth next year because of a decrease in what the company calls advertising load, or the number of ads that are inserted into the news feed. Facebook also said 2017 would be an â€œinvestment year,â€ with the possibility of increased costs in areas like hiring workers and spending on data centers. The stock sagged 7 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.Longer term, though, the trends remain favorable for Facebook. Web behemoths are increasingly reaping the benefits of a shift in advertising dollars toward digital outlets, which say they offer better ad targeting and ad delivery capabilities than traditional forms of advertising. In the first half of this year, digital advertising revenue grew 19 percent, largely because of Google and Facebook, according to estimates from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.Much of Facebookâ€™s recent advertising success has been driven by its video ad business, which has experienced tremendous growth over the last year. Facebook can command a premium on video ads. SocialCode, a digital advertising agency, said video ads accounted for some 47 percent of its clientsâ€™ Facebook and Instagram spending.â€œPeople are creating and sharing more video, and we think itâ€™s pretty clear that video is only going to become more important,â€ Mark Zuckerberg, Facebookâ€™s chief executive, said in a conference call on Wednesday. â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™re putting video first across our apps.â€That growth has not been without its stumbles. In September, Facebook revealed that it had inflated how much time its users were spending watching videos on the social network. The inaccurate figures were displayed to advertisers and publishers for more than two years, the company said. Facebook apologized for the error.Yet the misstep does not appear to have slowed Facebook down. In the third quarter, the company made $15.65 in revenue per user in the United States and Canada, up from $10.49 a year ago.Some of Facebookâ€™s other properties are also showing growth. The Facebook chat app Messenger now has more than 33,000 active chatbots, which use artificial intelligence to connect users to brands, after starting its bot initiative this spring. And Instagram Stories, the companyâ€™s competitor to a similar feature by Snapchat, has gained 100 million active users since it started in August.Newtonâ€™s laws of physics will ultimately catch up to Facebook. But for now, that day still seems far off.",1
"The following is one of a series of brief roundups of selected local newspaper editorials Monday: LIBERTY TIMES Is Taiwan ready to give away tax revenues to China? All of the agreements signed by the President Ma Ying-jeou administration with China have later proved to be eroding Taiwan's sovereignty and hollowing out its economic strength. The consequences of a tax accord to be signed at the upcoming round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks could be even more devastating. Once the agreement takes effect, China will have access to full data about business income taxes and personal income taxes paid to Taiwan's government by a number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China and their employees. As a result, the Chinese authorities will be able to levy taxes on those Taiwanese citizens' earnings or incomes grossed in China in the future -- a situation tantamount to Taiwan helping China levy taxes on Taiwanese citizens or handing over large sums of tax money to China's coffers. The result of the soon-to-be-signed agreement could further worsen Taiwan's tax shortfall and ultimately undermine its national strength. With so many bad omens on the horizon, we are saddened by our officials' ignorance, as they are still touting the merits of the pact in enhancing taxation transparency, avoiding double taxation on investors in each other's territories, attracting Chinese investors and increasing tax revenues. One of the Kuomintang government's biggest faults lies in its belief that China could be Taiwan's savior. It's like asking a ghost to write you a prescription. The Ma administration must remember that many of Taiwan's problems have their roots in China and that their solutions lie in Taiwan. Since revamping the ailing economy is Ma's top campaign promise, the government should start with improving Taiwan's investment climate by offering tax incentives and upgrading administrative efficiency to help enhance corporate competitiveness.

"Lindsay Vonn of the United States made it four in a row when she won the second women's World Cup downhill race here on Saturday. Vonn, who came home in 1min 09.12sec, has dominated the discipline since the start of the season and the world champion carried on from where she had left off Friday in crushing the competition. Swiss Nadja Kamer was second and Ingrid Jacquemod of France completed the podium. The race went ahead in difficult conditions and there were several stoppages owing to fog and fresh snowfalls with the start put back three times. The conditions forced organisers to shorten the course as well, putting the start line at the level of Sunday's Super-G. Swede Anja Paerson found the going relatively tough as she could only manage fifth. ",1
"PALMYRA, Syria â€” As my Hezbollah escort and I entered the modern city around Palmyra, we were greeted by the mangled body of an Islamic State fighter left to rot in the sun. He looked as if dogs might have gotten to him after Syrian government forces, backed by loyal militiamen, routed him and his comrades from the ancient city after almost a year of Islamic State control.In that time, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, destroyed some of the remains of a civilization that 2,000 years ago was a mix of Roman, Persian and local cultures.Where Palmyraâ€™s impressive Temple of Bel once stood, only a single stone archway was left to frame a rectangle of blue sky above the arid desert about 160 miles northeast of Damascus, the capital.I traveled to Palmyra on Saturday with members of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia allied with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, to see what remained of the archaeological treasures of Palmyra .The Lion of al-Lat, a 2,000-year-old statue of a lion holding a gazelle in its mouth, had been felled by an Islamic State demolition team. The lionâ€™s broken nose had been placed in front of a pile of ancient rubble, its two large nostrils pointing upward.Explosions leveled the stone walls and most of the Roman columns supporting the arches of the cityâ€™s gate. One of the Syrian militiamen fighting with Hezbollah remarked that the â€œruins have been ruined.â€Amid the ruins, we heard repeated booms emanating from the city center, where plumes of smoke and dust rose into the desert sky. My Hezbollah escort and Syrian soldiers explained that explosive-disposal teams were clearing mines left behind by retreating Islamic State fighters.Dusty brown burlap hoods littered the floor of the Roman amphitheater, where Islamic State gunmen theatrically staged a mass execution.We encountered remnants of the Islamic Stateâ€™s brutal, yearlong occupation strewn about the cityâ€™s celebrated ruins.The Hezbollah militiamen with whom I traveled were eager to show that their group had helped rescue Palmyra, a site important to world heritage. Russia, which provided air support; the Syrian Army; and other allied militias that helped fight the Islamic State are all claiming part of the credit for driving its forces out of the city.During their occupation, Islamic State fighters toppled the gates along the ancient Roman promenade, the Decumanus Maximus. Newly broken columns with stained exteriors revealed their white-stone cores and lay on piles of rubble alongside columns that had fallen centuries earlier.â€œOur enemies are so stupid,â€ Mohammad Salem, an Islamic State official, said from the outskirts of Palmyra, which lies beside the modern city of Tadmur. â€œWe captured a whole town and houses from them, and they recaptured sand and destruction.â€The grand Roman amphitheater in Palmyra remained standing, weeds growing between the cracks in the terraced seating built in the second century. On a wall on the back of the amphitheater stage, Islamic State gunmen had drawn two crude targets in chalk. Tight clusters of pockmarks on the ancient stone walls showed where the militants had been taking target practice.When I visited this weekend, the front gate of Palmyraâ€™s museum was locked with a heavy padlock, and buildings throughout the city had been heavily damaged by explosions.Experts say that all sides in the Syrian civil war have participated in the looting of antiquities. I saw a hole dug near one of the ancient sites where an underground chamber that may have been a crypt could be reached. Shards of pottery and bone fragments had been placed on a stone, as if people had been searching underground for artifacts.Despite the Islamic Stateâ€™s efforts, many of the ancient sites in Palmyra were undamaged. The destruction in the modern parts of Tadmur was far worse. Shops, cafes and houses in the city appeared to have been abandoned, empty of any signs of the once-vibrant city life in Syria.Syrian soldiers and allied militiamen said that if residents were allowed to return to the city, Islamic State fighters might come back with them, and attempt to re-establish their presence in the city.",1
"The woman who lodged a section 18C complaint against Bill Leak has accused the the cartoonistâ€™s lawyers of trying to coax the case into court because they were confident they would win.  Melissa Dinnison, who is a university student currently on exchange in Germany, said she had lodged the complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) because she wanted to have a â€œfrank and open discussionâ€ with Leak following his controversial cartoon depicting an Indigenous father.  Speaking publicly for the first time, Dinnison said she was not interested in going to court or claiming any compensation.   Related: The tirade about 18C is a massive piece of fakery, a culture war conceit | Richard Ackland   â€œBill Leak and his lawyers made it clear that they werenâ€™t going to cooperate with the conciliation process,â€ Dinnison told ABC AM. â€œSo I began to feel that I was being used to push an agenda and I felt that the Australian wanted to coax me into taking this to court because they were confident they would win.â€ Leakâ€™s cartoon shows an Indigenous policeman holding an Indigenous child by the scruff of his neck in front of his father, who holds a beer. When the policeman tells his father he should to talk to his son about personal responsibility, the father answers: â€œYeah righto whatâ€™s his name then?â€ The cartoon drew widespread condemnation, including from the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, and led to Suncorp bank withdrawing its advertising. But the ABCâ€™s new head of Indigenous affairs coverage, Stan Grant, has said it was a very complex image, though not a â€œparticularly great cartoonâ€, and he defended Leakâ€™s right to have it published. Dinnison said her main aim was talking to the cartoonist about the impact of his work, to â€œlisten to how these sort of cartoons impact on real everyday Aboriginal people who are trying their best to try and contribute to societyâ€. â€œI just really wanted to have a frank and open discussion with him which is what it says on the Human Rights Commission website about what conciliation is meant to be and he wasnâ€™t interested in cooperating, I donâ€™t think,â€ she said. â€œSo it didnâ€™t make a lot of sense to go ahead. â€œCartoons like this and such negative media representation make me feel like, it doesnâ€™t matter what I do or how hard I try itâ€™s never going to be good enough and people will always be able to reduce me and my people and my family to such horrible degrading cartoons.â€ Dinnison said she felt â€œthreatened and unsafeâ€ due to the relentless media attention, particularly from the Australian newspaper, which has been campaigning to change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.  â€œI felt threatened and unsafe with the relentless media attention. Because the Australian hasnâ€™t been able to get a hold of me they have gone after â€“ I feel they have gone after â€“ my family members and my partner which has made me feel very unsafe and very uneasy,â€ Dinnison said. The editor-in-chief of the Australian, Paul Whittaker, said Dinnisonâ€™s claim was â€œridiculousâ€ and described the Human Rights Commission as â€œthought policeâ€. Whittaker told his own paper: â€œThe Australian has and always will have an unwavering commitment to free speech and freedom of expression, two vital qualities in our democracy, which Ms Dinnison does not appear to share. â€œWe will always defend our journalists, our artists and our best free thinkers, of whom Bill Leak is an outstanding example, against unreasonable attempts by people like Ms Dinnison in concert with the thought police of the Australian Human Rights Commission. â€œThe idea being propagated now on the public broadcaster that Ms Dinnison, who wanted Bill Leak to stop drawing his honest cartoons, is somehow herself a victim of this process is absurd.â€ Last week the prime minister announced an inquiry by the human rights committee inquiry into the issue after mounting pressure from the conservative wing of the Liberal party. HRC president Gillian Triggs has indicated she is open to overhauling the Racial Discrimination Act, including replacing the terms â€œoffendâ€ and â€œinsultâ€ with â€œvilifyâ€.   Related: Bill Leak defends 'racist' cartoon amid widespread criticism   However the HRC race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane has said last week there was no case for changing the act. After Dinnison dropped the complaint, Leak said it had put him through a month or so of â€œincredible stressâ€. But Dinnison was unrepentant, saying the process was supposed to be private and 76% of cases were resolved through conciliation. â€œAll of the media attention that this has received has been through the newspaper he works for, so I feel like a lot of the attention that this has got is a direct result of him putting it out there. So no, I donâ€™t feel for him at all,â€ Dinnison said.",1
"Expressing concern that the injury could sideline him for the remainder of the postseason, Houston Rockets shooting guard James Harden confirmed Friday that he felt something pop in his lower beard during last nights game against the Golden State Warriors.

"A ripe mound of earth, festering with sickly flowers and garbage, rises from the upstairs stage of the Flea Theater these days. Audience members in the front row for â€œWolf in the Riverâ€ â€” which opened on Monday night in a highly intimate in-the-round production â€” could easily lean over and rub their faces in the muck, which may well be the symbolic intention of this playâ€™s creator, Adam Rapp.But mostly, this squalid pile exists as a place for an enthusiastic tribe of young theater folk â€” members of the Bats, the Fleaâ€™s resident acting company â€” to get dirty, histrionic and, on occasion, naked. It must be said that they seem to be having just as good a time doing so as Mr. Rapp apparently had writing and directing this tall and bloated tale of nasty doings on the banks of a cannibalistic river.Just so you know, we, the audience, are that river (as weâ€™re told early on). In the world of Mr. Rapp, everybody gets to be a metaphor.Mr. Rapp, whose â€œRed Light Winterâ€ was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is an uncommonly prolific and profuse playwright who wallows shamelessly and happily in excess. No bare-bones minimalism for this advocate of all things purple and lurid, who apparently never met a poetic image or theatrical shock tactic he couldnâ€™t find a use for.Most of his work involves disaffected and dysfunctional Americans perpetrating gory acts of violence upon one another in environments that embrace both blighted urban apartments and affluent suburban homes. For â€œWolf in the River,â€ he has ventured into Dogpatch territory, where â€” it may surprise you to learn â€” disaffected and dysfunctional Americans perpetrate gory acts of violence upon one another.This particular group of feral young things belongs to an indigent tribe ruled by the tyrannical and sadistic Monty Mae Maloney (Xanthe Paige), a woman with a smokinâ€™ body and BeyoncÃ© moves. Monty, who keeps the members of her clan solvent by selling their plasma to blood banks, wields a crocodile-headed cane to squelch any signs of rebellion.Pity, then, poor liâ€™l Tana Weed (a very good, very brave Kate Thulin), a wistful 16-year-old with dreams of crossing the river that keeps her from her true love, Debo (Maki Borden), a skiff-riding swain with a passion for old cars. She canâ€™t expect any assistance from her brother, Dothan (William Apps), a veteran who returned mute and deranged from the war in Afghanistan, where he committed unspeakable atrocities.Filling out the surrogate family portrait are Aikin (Karen Eilbacher), Montyâ€™s trusted right hand, who eats the fantastical, senses-numbing flowers that grow in abundance, and the simple-minded Pin (Mike Swift), first seen copulating with a blowup sex doll.Tanaâ€™s story is narrated and annotated by the bare-chested Man (Jack Ellis), also known as the Wolf, who occasionally takes on the role of Montyâ€™s sedentary mama, Dumptruck Lorna. The Man is prone to flights of savage lyricism. A typical example: â€œThe moon is a sickled leopardâ€™s tooth pinned to obsidian, its light silvering the violent undulations scoring the skin of your unforgiving water.â€Or, if you prefer a folksier approach: â€œTime is a tricky old sow, ainâ€™t she?â€ Or Aikinâ€™s description of swimming in the river: â€œThe drum fish was drumminâ€™, and the catfish had they hackles up, and them cottonmouths was slitherinâ€™ with the quickness.â€ It is easy to imagine â€œWolfâ€ as a collaboration between Tennessee Williams and Erskine Caldwell, both deep in their cups.The artery-clogging prose is enlivened by the vivacious staging, which makes fecund use of Arnulfo Maldonadoâ€™s set. (Michael Hili and Hallie Elizabeth Newton did the barely there, recycled-looking costumes, and Masha Tsimring, the creepy lighting.)The ensemble, which includes a backup group called the Lost Choir that roams the audience like the walking dead in search of brains, periodically breaks into haunting bucolic song or choral sighs and whispers. Ms. Paigeâ€™s wicked Monty leads a pop-siren production number that suggests a down-market variation on a Super Bowl halftime show.The production also makes dexterous and multifarious use of Montyâ€™s cane, a derelict refrigerator and, for the climax, a thick suspended rope. Warning: The cast members will be very much in your midst throughout, sharing their glee at the chance to act up a hillbilly storm beneath that olâ€™ sickled leopardâ€™s-tooth moon.",1
"The National Endowment for the Arts announced Monday that it has begun construction on a $1.3 billion, 14-line lyric poemits largest investment in the nation's aesthetic- industrial complex since the $850 million interpretive-dance budget of 1985. 'America's metaphors have become strained beyond recognition, our nation's verses are severely overwrought, and if one merely examines the internal logic of some of these archaic poems, they are in danger of completely falling apart,' said the project's head stanza foreman Dana Gioia. 'We need to make sure America's poems remain the biggest, best-designed, best-funded poems in the world.' Gioia confirmed that the public-works composition will be assembled letter-by-letter atop a solid base of the relationship between man and nature. The poem's structure, laid out extensively on lined-paper blueprints, involves a traditional three- quatrain-and-a-couplet framework, which will be tethered to an iambic meter for increased stability and symmetry. If the planners can secure an additional $6.2 million in funding, they may affix a long dash to the end of line three, though Gioia said that is a purely optimistic projection at this stage. The poem is expected not only to revitalize the community, Gioia said, but also create jobs for the nation's hundreds of out-of-work poets. According to the proposed budget, the poem's 224 authors have allocated $4 million for the final rhyming couplet, $52 million to insert hyphens into the word 'tomorrow' so it reads 'to-morrow,' $7.45 for a used copy of John Keats' Selected Poems for ideas and inspiration, and $450 million for a simile likening human fate to the wind. Some experts, however, say the poem is already at risk of going over budget, citing the soaring $5,000-per-square-inch cost of vellum, and an ambitious but perhaps ill-conceived $135 million undertaking to make the word 'owl' rhyme with 'soul.' 'We've already put 200 hours of manpower into the semicolon at the end of the first stanza,' said Charles Simic, poet laureate of the United States and head author of the still- untitled piece. 'And I've got my best guys working around the clock to convert all the 'overs' in the piece into one-syllable 'o'ers.' I got [Nobel Prize winner Seamus] Heaney and [Margaret] Atwood stripping all the V's and tacking apostrophes in their place. It's grunt work, but somebody's got to do it if this poem's going to get done.' Gioia denied allegations that the poem is being mismanaged, claiming that he has implemented several measures to keep the project on schedule, including giving no more than two words to each poet, limiting alliteration and assonance to a maximum of three words per line, cutting out all extraneous allusions to Eliot and Yeats, and restricting any unwieldy metaphors hinting at the vast alienation of modernity. Although the poem is still in the early stages of construction, it has already come under fire for serious structural issues, including a shaky foundation and a half-dozen partial synecdoches. 'This poem is an eyesore,' said literary critic Stanley Fish. 'The whole right side of the verse is barely being held up by a load-bearing enjambment, and it seems as if they just sloppily patched up all the holes in the piece with plagiarized Rod McKuen passages.' In addition, the tenuous line that was being drawn between the narrator's mortality and winter unexpectedly collapsed on itself Monday. Two poets were killed in the incident. 'Sure, some of the imagery might be beautiful, but is this poem actually going to be useful?' Fish said. 'Or are people just going to look at it and go, 'Huh. Interesting.' Why not put this money toward something everybody can enjoy, like a TV pilot or a New Yorker cartoon caption?' 'The government needs to stop throwing billions of dollars at the arts,' he added. Fish cautioned that previous attempts to funnel money into poetry had been cut short before they were fully completed, resulting in the large number of unfinished, million-dollar poems that are still lying unread across the country to this day.

"After the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew out in the Gulf of Mexico some 50 miles from the nearest land, responders were left to cope with a search area of nearly 40,000 square miles, as well as wind and currents that kept evidence of damage away from the more easily searchable coastline.Patrollers recovered fewer than 3,000 dead birds. But some had suspected that many more were unaccounted for.Now a team of scientists has tried to quantify the extent of damage inflicted on the gulfâ€™s bird population from the oil spill caused by the explosion. Based on models using publicly available data, the studies estimated that about 800,000 birds died in coastal and offshore waters.â€œPart of the reason they discovered so few carcasses is because the oceanographic currents for the most part moved them away,â€ said Jeffrey Short, a marine chemist and a co-author of the studies.The findings are bound to be disputed. The science of calculating the number of birds affected in such a catastrophe remains imprecise, and studies by BP and the federal government are not yet publicly available for comparison.The studies also illustrate the difficulty of calculating a death toll in geographically difficult circumstances â€” and of establishing a figure that is widely accepted, particularly amid legal battles.Dr. Short and two colleagues conducted the studies for two law firms representing clients with environmental impact claims against BP stemming from the explosion of the rig on April 20, 2010.Dr. Short spent most of his 31-year career with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studying the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska and mired in resulting lawsuits. Chris Haney, another of the authors, is the chief scientist for Defenders of Wildlife, which has been involved in lawsuits against BP.In a statement, Jason Ryan, a spokesman for BP America, questioned the objectivity of the researchers. He also questioned their methodology, arguing that some of the authorsâ€™ assumptions are not supported by data collected for the Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a collaborative effort by the responsible parties and the federal government that is required after major oil spills.While the damage assessment studies are not complete, â€œanalysis of field observations conducted to date indicate that population and nesting impacts from the spill on birds were limited,â€ said Mr. Ryan, adding that BP intended to publish bird and other data online at gulfsciencedata.bp.com.While the ratio of deaths to carcasses varies from spill to spill, it is typically estimated at 10 to 1 or lower. But Dr. Shortâ€™s research, to be published in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series, makes the case for a significantly higher ratio for the gulf spill.Steve Hampton, a resource economist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife who models bird deaths for West Coast oil spills, found the estimate high. (Most Gulf Coast bird specialists cannot comment on independent research because they are involved in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment.) Dr. Hampton argued that the team needed additional data not yet publicly available, like more specific information about where carcasses were spotted, to establish a reliable kill count.â€œThatâ€™s really off the charts of what weâ€™ve ever seen,â€ he said of the estimated deaths. â€œIt just begs a lot of questions.â€But some researchers say circumstances in the gulf can make carcass recoveries particularly low â€” among them prevailing winds and currents, as well as the disappearance of bodies before they reached shore because of factors like controlled surface oil fires, tiger sharks and decay rates in sweltering heat. And the search area encompassed more than 4,000 miles of coastline.Jordan Karubian, a bird ecologist at Tulane University in New Orleans, said he found the estimates reasonable. â€œGiven the degree of uncertainty weâ€™re dealing with inherently in the process, my sense is that these researchers were careful to be conservative.â€The new studies were based on two established modeling techniques to overcome the challenges. A primary study estimated bird deaths in coastal waters within 25 miles of shore, which was assumed to be the farthest a carcass could drift before disappearing. Using public data on the number of dead birds found during and after the spill, they calculated the likelihood of finding a given bird by factoring in daily winds and currents, carcass drift speeds and carcass disappearance rates on shorelines from decay and scavenging, among other parameters.The team considered only carcasses of coastal species that spend time over or in the water, such as gannets and pelicans, and that were visibly oiled.The carcass count then dropped to 2,004 from the initial 3,000. By comparison, a recent California spill 1,000 times smaller than Deepwater Horizon yielded 1,500 carcasses.The teamâ€™s second coastal model used data on the locations of oil slicks on each day during the spill and several days afterward. They also studied data on the numbers and habits of birds typically found offshore. The model calculated the likelihood that a bird would land in oil, an event likely to kill it by interrupting feeding patterns or causing other complications. Multiplying that probability by the estimated birds present yielded the second death estimate.The researchers found both results to be similar despite the uncertainties and the divergent methods. The first model estimated about 600,000 deaths, with an uncertainty range of 320,000 to 1.2 million birds. The second model estimated 800,000 deaths with an uncertainty range of 160,000 to 1.9 million.For a companion paper to be published soon, the authors used another model to estimate likely bird deaths farther than 25 miles offshore, where sooty terns and band-rumped storm petrels, among other species rarely seen from land, could be found. They estimate there were 120,000 deaths, with the uncertainty range at 25,000 to 400,000.By comparison, the still-contested estimate in the much smaller Exxon Valdez spill was about 300,000, with an uncertainty range of 100,000 to 690,000.Beyond counting the dead, researchers say a major challenge will be determining what, if any, long-term effects the losses will have on the areaâ€™s ecology.Melanie Driscoll, an ornithologist with the Audubon Society in Baton Rouge, La., said the work has â€œtremendous valueâ€ for restoration planning. But, she said, â€œthis is a really big number, and itâ€™s still too small.â€ Thatâ€™s because, by design, the study didnâ€™t consider categories such as marsh birds, among other limitations.Dr. Shortâ€™s team tested its results by comparing them with an independent source of bird data, an annual Audubon Society citizen science event called the Christmas Bird Count. The researchers had teased out of their aggregate numbers the impact on some species. They estimated that 40 percent of northern gulf laughing gulls had died, for instance.Christmas Bird Count data also showed a roughly 40 percent drop in laughing gull sightings.Dr. Hampton, who was skeptical of the estimates, found this result at least potentially significant. â€œI thought that was interesting, and there may be something to it,â€ he said.",1
"The Victorian premier has unveiled a 10-year plan that will ensure successive governments deliver all 227 recommendations of Australiaâ€™s first royal commission into family violence, along with new funding and education campaigns. Daniel Andrewsâ€™ announcement on Thursday morning brought the former Australian of the year and family violence survivor Rosie Batty, and many other survivors and advocates in the room, to tears. The plan was among the royal commissionâ€™s recommendations handed down in March and was needed, the commission said, to detail exactly how the government would implement the enormous number of recommendations and hold itself to account.   Related: Overhaul 'broken system' of dealing with domestic violence, says royal commission   â€œThe commission gave the sector a voice and it gave governments nowhere to hide,â€ Andrews told a room full of family violence survivors, advocates and front-line workers on Thursday morning. â€œIt has brought into the open something that for too long hasnâ€™t been given the attention, the priority and the leadership it absolutely deserves.â€ He said the commissionâ€™s work had uncovered â€œcountless failuresâ€ including â€œshamefully, how governments for a very long time had not listened and not actedâ€. The plan was a key measure to ensure the state government, and successive governments, would be forced to act and implement reform, Andrews said. Some reforms had already been initiated immediately after the completion of the royal commissionâ€™s work.  â€œThis plan provides a pathway for implementing every other recommendation made by the royal commission,â€ Andrews said. â€œIt extends right across the government and right across the state a plan for this term of government and the one after that and the one after that so, no matter who the government is, we are accountable to deliver on all of these reforms. â€œIf we are to be the state, the community that we all aspire to be: a fair and strong and decent place, a national leader, then we need to get this right and we need to do more. And that is exactly what I intend to do.â€ Andrews announced a further $218m in social housing and private rental assistance to keep women and children who are fleeing family violence safe, bringing investment in that sector to $600m since the royal commission handed down its findings. Next year, reforms will be introduced to parliament to strengthen intervention orders, tighten up the bail process and allow better information sharing between police and other agencies to ensure perpetratorsâ€™ privacy is not protected ahead of keeping women and children safe. New bodies will be created to ensure the measures were implemented, including a coordination agency to oversee the creation and support of safety hubs being established across the state, one-stop shops where victims will be able to access a range of services to keep them safe. A prevention agency will also be established with dedicated funding focusing on providing the best advice. The announcements on Thursday followed the Victorian governmentâ€™s $572m investment in family violence detailed in the 2016-17 budget. A further 10-year investment plan focusing on funding will be released in March. Andrews announced a television advertising campaign focused on changing menâ€™s behaviour that would run for â€œyearsâ€. He then said every recommendation from the coronial inquest into the death of 11-year-old Luke Batty, who was killed by his father on a cricket field in Tyabb, Victoria, in 2014, would be implemented. The plan does not have Labor government branding on it and is intended as a measure to be used by successive governments, no matter which party is in power.   Related: Luke Batty inquest: coroner lays blame for death solely on boy's father   Batty, the chairwoman of Victoriaâ€™s Victim Survivorsâ€™ Advisory Council, was overwhelmed by the announcement. â€œI hope I can speak,â€ she told the room. â€œAs victims of family violence, we have been betrayed of our power and our safety. â€œWe know what itâ€™s like to be ignored, we know what itâ€™s like to experience a systemâ€™s shortcoming, we know what itâ€™s like to be blamed for the acts of violence committed against us. â€œWe know what itâ€™s like and how it feels when our loved ones are killed. Our wisdom comes from our lived experience.â€ The advisory group had been essential to helping the government determine how to best implement the recommendations, she said. Importantly the measures being implemented by the government would protect survivors and give them a strong voice, she said. â€œSilencing victims protects the perpetrator,â€ she said through tears. â€œIt condones their behaviour. It robs victims and survivors of their dignity. To women who may be living in fear, know that you are courageous. You are strong. And to all Victorians: we need to speak out against this.â€ Responding to the plan, the chief executive of Domestic Violence Victoria, Fiona McCormack, admitted that she was among those initially skeptical sceptical of the need for a royal commission. â€œWe already know what we need,â€ she said. â€œI thought, â€˜Couldnâ€™t that money be better invested?â€™ And what do you know, the royal commission comes out with a cracker of a report and then we have the Victorian government saying, â€˜We will implement every one of those 227 recommendationsâ€™ and that commitment is reiterated in this plan. â€œAnd then we have funding. We have always struggled so hard for that in the context of rising demand, and women and children being murdered.â€ She urged bipartisan support for the plan.   Related: Luke Batty: killed by a father no one truly knew   â€œItâ€™s an issue neglected for a long time. Itâ€™s complex. If this was compromised by a change of government, it would be a tragic waste.â€ Through tears she urged the federal government to support recommendations from the commission only it could support, such as new Medicare items for family violence survivors.  â€¢ The National Sexual Assault, Domestic Family Violence Counselling Service can be reached at 1800 737 732.

"LinkedIn is a site where workers memorialize their professional lives and look for new careers. Now, after its recent purchase by Microsoft for $26.2 billion, one good measure of the mergerâ€™s success may be how few LinkedIn employees start using their own product.As Nick Wingfield writes, the deal enters a pantheon of big Microsoft acquisitions, many of which have largely failed. How could this one be different?The failed acquisitions of companies like aQuantive (a $6 billion deal, in 2007) and Nokia, ($7.2 billion, 2013) seem like deals that were meant to help Microsoft catch up in businesses like online search and mobility. In both cases, that strategy appeared not to work.The companies, bought by Steve Ballmer, the previous Microsoft chief executive, were hauled up to Microsoftâ€™s headquarters outside Seattle, where they never fit in. (In fairness to Microsoftâ€™s methods, thatâ€™s also what happened with Skype, an $8.5 billion deal made in 2011 that is regarded as a success.)As Nick writes, LinkedIn is more like the 2014 purchase of Mojang, the maker of the popular game Minecraft. Neither was that acquisition meant to make up ground in an existing industry, nor did it result in the acquired company being uprooted. In LinkedInâ€™s case, the current Microsoft chief Satya Nadella appears to be happy to let it stay on its own turf, with as much of the existing team as possible remaining in place. In other words, they will be home and happy instead of out on LinkedIn, looking for another job.But there is more to it than that with LinkedIn, and not just because the purchase more than three times the size of the Skype deal â€” previously Microsoftâ€™s biggest purchase â€” or because of the siteâ€™s popularity as a job-hunting tool.Mr. Nadella is taking Microsoft from its roots in software for personal computers and computer servers into the new era of cloud computing and mobile devices, increasingly with artificial intelligence acting as an intermediary.LinkedIn matters to Microsoft for both the A.I. talent it has on its staff and the huge amount of data it holds on its users. A.I. generally works better when it has large and varied data sets from which to draw information.LinkedInâ€™s vast collection of data is, in fact, why Salesforce, which was once courting with Microsoft over its own possible acquisition, now objects  to the purchase of LinkedIn.For Mr. Nadella to succeed, he doesnâ€™t need LinkedIn to be a part of Microsoft, in the sense of being deeply grafted into the rest of the company. He needs it to keep growing, building up data, and holding on to talent. In other words, he needs it to be the best LinkedIn possible.",1
"Dreamworld will conduct a sweeping review of all its mechanical rides after more than 200 staff returned to work on Monday. The Queensland amusement park has been closed since last week when a malfunction on its Thunder River Rapids ride led to the death of four people. The accident sparked an immediate coronial investigation, a police investigation and an inquiry by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland. Since then the park has faced a barrage of criticism, with the Australian Workersâ€™ Union and others saying it had previously raised safety concerns. Documents released by Queenslandâ€™s workplace regulator also showed that air compressors on 13 Dreamworld rides, including the rapids ride, were deemed â€œnot fit for serviceâ€ in an inspection four years ago.   Related: Dreamworld owner appoints disaster recovery expert to 'rebuild trust'   On Monday Dreamworldâ€™s chief executive, Craig Davidson, said more than 200 staff had returned to work, although the park would remain closed to the public until further notice. â€œWe have commenced a systematic and methodical park-wide safety review of every mechanical ride in our park,â€ he said. â€œThis will include the appointment of armâ€™s-length and independent work-leading mechanical engineering and workplace safety experts.â€ The review would include internal and external audits, and would be â€œworking closelyâ€ with the workplace health and safety team. The reports would be made publicwhen they are complete. Davidson also responded to a report in the Australian that said the cyclone ride at Dreamworld had been operating with fewer staff than recommended by the manufacturer. â€œThe configuration of the cyclone ride at Dreamworld is different to the operating manual referred to,â€ he said. â€œDreamworldâ€™s one-car cyclone ride and the staff operating procedures were approved through four separate tiers. â€œIncorrect reporting of misinformation, intentional or otherwise, is frankly unhelpful.â€ The coronial inquiry into the incident is in its early stages.",1
"What is it that the British viewing public love so much about watching people who canâ€™t dance? Well, we do love a tryer. And no one is trying harder than Ed Balls in Strictly Come Dancing. In fact he was trying so hard not to drop his professional partner Katya Jones this weekend during their routine to (Is This the Way to) Amarillo that he came very close to dropping her. It was not the way to Amarillo. It was very nearly the way toÂ casualty with a head injury, narrowly prevented by some frantic grabbing in the chest area.   Related: Ed Balls survives for another week on Strictly Come Dancing   But do the public voters punish his clumsiness? Of course not. They reward it. And so Ballsâ€™s failed lift joins John Sergeantâ€™s â€œsack of potatoesâ€ routine from 2008 in the Strictly Hall of Try-Hard Fame. This was where, during an attempt at a paso doble, Sergeant pulled Kristina Rihanoff along the floor by the wrists, as she clung on for dear life. Surely these poor women (Rihanoff, born Vladivostok; Jones, born St Petersburg) did not escape the hell of Russiaâ€™s merciless dance schools for this? The pro dancers must find the whole thing â€“ and the publicâ€™s delight in it â€“ incredibly perverse. And it is. Whether you approve of Ballsâ€™s overnight popularity, his appeal is undeniable. Personally I find his attempts admirable but only vaguely amusing. And I do worry for the sanity and general wellbeing of his dance partner. Iâ€™m guessing he wouldnâ€™t try the same on Yvette Cooper in the kitchen. Although maybe she too has a strong core and can support herself without any momentum. (Iâ€™ll stop now.)     Ed Balls nearly drops partner Katya Jones during Strictly routine â€“Â video  The real key to his renaissance, though, is the narrow view people have of politicians. Balls is not having to do much at all for people to think that heâ€™s a crazy, fun guy. He just shows up and dances relatively poorly. There are no sideshow gimmicks, no quips or one-liners, no charisma, no showbiz sparkle. His participation alone â€“ willing but inept â€“ is enough to make him seem like â€œa legendâ€. While Balls is an inspiration of sorts in an era where weâ€™ve come to regard virtually all politicians as worms, thereâ€™s something a bit tragic about this. Man in Mildly Amusing Diversion Outside Politics Shocker. Do we really credit our public servants with so little imagination, so little talent and so few (it has to be said) balls, that we will applaud them just for turning up, having a go and not being utterly despicable? It would seem so. Heirs and spares You donâ€™t have to be a fan of the monarchy to spare a thought for Prince Andrewâ€™s daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, unceremoniously denied an official public role by their granny. This means they have to get by with proper jobs, no security detail and a â€œsmall shared flatâ€ in St Jamesâ€™s Palace. Andrew is said to be furious, but â€œCharles calls the shotsâ€ (says a source) â€œand he wants the royal family giving value for moneyâ€. Now Iâ€™m very much a republican (not the Trump variety) but it does seem a bit mean. If they want to go to cut ribbons at charity events, let them. Surely the money rolling in from all the gawping at the Circus of Divinely Beautiful Small Children (AKA Prince George and Princess Charlotte) can pay for that? Or is the money not actually rolling in from that?

"Michelle Obama Facing Massive New Lawsuit For Secretive Family Outing According to recent reports, Judicial Watch has just filed a lawsuit against the federal government for failing to disclose just how much taxpayers spent on the Obamas family outing to Africa. During the trip, the family went on a safari and several other costly outings. According to WND, the suit requests records for the travel expenses the family picked up on the six day trip to South Africa and Botswana. The White House has a few weeks to respond. How much did the American people spend to send the First Lady on a family outing in Africa? Thats what we want to know, claims Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. On the surface, the trip seems to have been totally unnecessary and was as much an excuse for the Obama family to go on a safari as it was a mission intended to advance the nations business in Africa. Yes, you heard that right. The professed purpose of Mrs. Obamas trip was to encourage young people living in South Africa and Botswana to get involved in national affairs, the lawsuit against the first Lady reeds. The First Ladys remarks focused on education, health and wellness issues. However, accompanied by her daughters Malia and Sasha, her mother Marian Robinson, and her niece and nephew, Leslie and Avery Robinson, the trip also included such tourist events as visits to historical landmarks and museums. One source in the White House claims that the trip cost an estimated $430,000. What do you think? Are you sick of the Obamas taking lavish vacations at our expense? ",0

"Dozens of pro-Beijing lawmakers staged a walkout from the Hong Kong legislature on Wednesday to stop the swearing-in of two pro-independence politicians.   Related: Rebel Hong Kong politicians defy China at chaotic swearing-in ceremony   Sixtus â€œBaggioâ€ Leung and Yau Wai-ching of the radical activist Youngspiration party were among five lawmakers expected to redo their swearing-in so they can take office. They were part of a new wave of activist candidates who were elected last month amid a rising tide of anti-China sentiment in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Yau and Leung sparked outrage from the pro-Beijing establishment when their first oaths were rejected by legislative officials last week. On that occasion they pledged allegiance to the â€œHong Kong nationâ€ and displayed a banner declaring that â€œHong Kong is not Chinaâ€, using language some legislators portrayed as derogatory Japanese slang. On Wednesday, after two others recited their oaths properly, the pro-Beijing lawmakers staged a walkout, depriving the chamber of the quorum needed to continue. They blasted Leung and Yau for being â€œdisrespectfulâ€ and insulting China and demanded they apologise.     Hong Kong politicians defy China as they are sworn in.  The councilâ€™s president adjourned the meeting after 15 minutes because there were not enough members to continue. It is unclear when swearing-in will take place.  Senior pro-establishment lawmaker Regina Ip said she generally disapproved of walkouts, but the legislators had no option after the pair refused to apologise for â€œinsulting our motherlandâ€. â€œThis is a very exceptional case involving a fundamental principle which involves loyalty to your country and adherence to our oath of upholding the ... law,â€ she said. Yau said it was the pro-establishment camp that needed to apologise as they were â€œthe ones who really betrayed the Hong Kong peopleâ€. New legislative president Andrew Leung, himself a pro-establishment figure, stood by his defiance of government efforts to ban Yau and Leung. â€œThey are duly elected â€¦ and I have a constitutional duty to safeguard their rights to fulfil their duties as legislative council members,â€ he said.  The government had sought to bar the pair from taking their oaths again but failed in an unprecedented legal attempt on Tuesday to halt the swearing-in. However, high court judge Thomas Au did approve the governmentâ€™s request for a judicial review of the case, which will take place early next month, in which authorities will formally challenge the decision to allow Leung, 30, and Yau, 25, to retake their oaths. The pair are part of a new generation of Hong Kong activists determined to force issues of self-determination and independence on to the mainstream political agenda.  Outside the legislature on Wednesday, hundreds of pro-Beijing protesters thronged the grounds, some carrying placards of the pair dressed in Japanese army uniforms that denounced them as â€œtraitorsâ€ and â€œdogsâ€. Others chanted that the pair must step down to protect Chinaâ€™s â€œdignityâ€.

Leung and Yau had mispronounced China as Shina, an archaic Japanese term for the country that is seen as derogatory. Leung crossed his fingers while taking the oath while Yau pledged allegiance to â€œthe Hong Kong special administrative region of the Peopleâ€™s Refucking of Shinaâ€.

"Federal Judge Makes Ruling On Cancellation Of Redskins... The Washington Redskins were able to keep their team name after facing immense criticism from the liberal media and public. Now, a federal judge ruled today that the teams trademark registration will be cancelled. Although the ruling claims that the team can continue using the Redskins name, it will lose many of the protections guaranteed by a federally-registered trademark. The Redskins sued a group of five Native American activists last August after their trademark registration was voided. The group claimed that the name and logo of the football team are insensitive to Native Americans. Of course, the Redskins are pushing back against the ruling and are planning to file a series of appeals. In the meantime, the trademark registration will not be officially removed. I am surprised by the judges decision to prevent us from presenting our evidence in an open trial, team president Bruce Allen told reporters. We look forward to winning on appeal after a fair and impartial review of the case. We are convinced that we will win because the facts and the law are on the side of our franchise that has proudly used the name Redskins for more than 80 years. What do you think of the Redskins stand for their rights? Do you think that their name and logo are racist? ",0
"BREAKING: Entire U.S. Senate Votes Unanimously To Defy Obama According to a recent statement released by the U.S. Senate, there will be no confirmation hearings for President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nomination under any circumstance.

"Explaining that the measure is intended to protect politicians right to free expression against undue scrutiny from the general population, a new ruling implemented this week by the Federal Election Commission allows candidates running for public office to remain completely anonymous throughout the campaign process. Candidates should be able to make themselves heard without having their identities, personal associations, and records on the issues exposed in the public eye, said agency spokesperson Wayne Branson, adding that the new policy means congressional hopefuls can avoid being personally challenged on their agendas by opting to withhold their names and likenesses from all campaign material, television commercials, FEC filings, and public appearances. The fact that political candidates are no longer under any obligation to disclose who they are will ensure a freer, more open electoral process. It is our belief that elections should be about ideas and plans for the country, not about who is saying them, what that person looks like, what their background might be, if theyre qualified, or what motives they might have. Branson confirmed that elected candidates would then have the option to remain anonymous for the duration of their term. ",0
"Judge Orders Pink Slime Silence to Protect CompanyHeather Callaghan Lean-finely-texturized-beef (LFTB) is a meat filler made from ammoniated boneless lean beef scraps, connective tissue or similar products, which are considered unfit for human consumption until ammonium hydroxide has been added due to e.coli and salmonella. It wasdog food until the meat industry lobbied its use as meat filler for us. South Dakota-based company Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) filed legal action in 2010 to block records release after they were requested by a Seattle food safety law firm and the New York Times. Last month, District JudgeDale Ruigh upheld the block and ruled that releasing those records would do irreparable harm and reveal information about proprietary food-processing techniques. The harm to both company and consumer has already been done. What is so scandalous that we dont already know? Did he find something else? Do the records confess something previously omitted? It doesnt sound like he has had negative findings. Perhaps BPI anticipated a backlash and filed in 2010 to hold it off. So much for any kind of transparency. For whatever reason, BPI doesnt want it out there and the judge agrees it would harm the already failing company. BPI had to close down 3 out of its 4 branches. selfnews outrage caused grocery and fast food chains to drop LFBT. A disgruntled former employee tried to sue Diane Sawyer, ABC company, Jamie Oliver, and a food blogger for damages, yet it coincides with his book deal about Pink Slime ruining his life he retracted the lawsuit. The vast public didnt know about the ammonium gas because the product isnt labeled as such its considered a part of the process and generally recognized as safe by the government. And that product is mixed into ground beef as a filler, also considered a part of processing. But if a sickness breaks out, it would be impossible to trace think of the variety of sources cattle ground beef comes from; now think of the filler scraps. The meat industry had the sheer gall to blame the public for finding out (not unlike a Scooby-Doo villain) and for jobs lost. They retaliated by threatening higher prices without the filler. Way to serve. Meanwhile, the real culprits the FDA and USDA escaped the PR nightmare. With all the fuss about food safety with the Food Safety Modernization Act and raw milk scare tactics, one would think the FDA and USDA would come down hard on companies whose products could either trigger deadly food sickness or reaction from ammonia treatment. But they continue to protect it and shove it on school children its voluntary, but many budget-strapped schools will continue to serve it in the National School Lunch Program as it has been deemed safe. The Obama administration has imparted hundreds of millions to the FDA for food safety in its newest campaign, which spends millions to harass peaceful farmers and yields to corporate moguls and subsidized darlings.

"If I had cornflakes for breakfast (which I donâ€™t), I would have choked on them, reading Andrew Parkerâ€™s view of the threat posed by Russia, not just to the world at large â€“ that is a commonplace of the â€œnew cold warâ€ discourse â€“ but to the stability of the UK. With the majority vote for Brexit against the strong preference of Scotland and Northern Ireland for remain, we have shown ourselves quite capable of inflicting potentially fatal harm to our national stability all by ourselves. Why would we need Russia to do it for us?   Related: MI5 head: â€˜increasingly aggressiveâ€™ Russia a growing threat to UK   That was a knee-jerk reaction to the main thrust of the MI5 chiefâ€™s first national newspaper interview in the agencyâ€™s history. But a second, more substantial, response chased behind it in the form of a rather basic, and recurrent, question. Why is the UK establishment in general, and UK intelligence in particular, so fixated on a supposed threat from Russia? The cold war is a quarter-century behind us. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved; the Soviet Union collapsed. Todayâ€™s Russia has three quarters of the territory but only half the population of the old Soviet Union. Its GDP, whether overall or per capita, is far below that of the US, or ours. Its 2015 military budget took 5% of that â€“ $70bn in actual money â€“ less than an eighth of the nearly $600bn spent by the US. â€œTsarâ€ Vladimir Putin may have played a weak hand magnificently, as judged by admirers and detractors alike, but a weak hand is still a weak hand. If Russia really harbours ambitions to reconstitute an empire, its only success to date is the expensive (in every respect) reacquisition of Crimea, a contested no-manâ€™s land of ragtag rebels in the rust belt of eastern Ukraine, and two miniature enclaves inside independent Georgia. That recent â€œshow of forceâ€, when the might of the Russian navy made its stately progress through the English Channel, demonstrated only the obsolescence of the erstwhile superpowerâ€™s fleet. In the same interview, Parker disclosed that there were around 3,000 â€œviolent Islamic extremists in the UK, mostly Britishâ€, and that cyber, not just in Russiaâ€™s hands, was the threat of the future. So let me repeat the question: why does Russia remain bogeyman-in-chief? Here are a few ideas. The first is that blaming Russia carries little cost. Russia is not China. Investment is not a big consideration. For all sorts of reasons, political relations have long been dire. Applying the same virulent rhetoric to terrorism conducted in the name of Islam, on the other hand, risks fomenting social and cultural strife here at home. A second reason, now as in the past, is that blaming Russia aligns us comfortably with the US, where stalwarts in Congress and at the Pentagon have never emerged from their old thinking about the threat. The Russia card has been played to exhaustion during this presidential campaign, to the point where it could swing the election â€“ and I donâ€™t mean in Donald Trumpâ€™s favour. A third factor is the consensus about a strong and malevolent Russia that still rules the â€œexpertâ€ community, and will probably do so for a few years yet â€“ helped along by the hatchet-faced Putin. There are younger specialists who take a rather different view, but they are drowned out by the ingrained cliches. Note how quickly Boris Johnson was â€œturnedâ€ from the realist of his journalist days to the fierce cold warrior foreign secretary. Such a U-turn makes him look intellectually foolish â€“ but no more foolish, some might argue, than he has made himself look on so many other scores.   Related: Theresa May should beware Putin: he doesnâ€™t do â€˜cooperationâ€™ | Luke Harding   Then again, all this anti-Russianism from MI5 could just be a front. Although it is hard to understand what purpose would be served by presenting Russians as scarier than jihadis or the gangsters who supposedly roam London in search of machine guns, disinformation is the stock in trade of intelligence services everywhere. Or â€“ perish the thought â€“ the judgments could just be wrong. There have, after all, been egregious mistakes, even where the material has been gathered and interpreted in good faith. Look no further than the data on Iraqâ€™s chemical weapons, as assessed by Parkerâ€™s colleagues and institutional rivals across the Thames. I wonder, though, whether the real secret behind the MI5 chiefâ€™s Russia focus is that it is starting to become harder to demonise Russia now. Time was when James Bond and the pantomime idea of a Russia threat were an easy sell â€“ able to bolster departmental claims to a bigger budget. But look at the â€œbelow the lineâ€ comments on what Parker had to say and there is a current of dissent that cannot come exclusively from so-called Kremlin â€œtrollsâ€. You hear something similar in phone-ins on Russian topics, where the voice of a sceptical public comes across loud and strong. For all MI5â€™s warnings, maybe Russiaâ€™s time as the UKâ€™s all-purpose fall guy is nearing its end.",1
"Dated, despondent and pretty much a disaster, â€œCellâ€ plays like a series of nods to other science fiction-horror hybrids, notably â€œThe Matrixâ€ (1999) and Philip Kaufmanâ€™s 1978 remake of â€œInvasion of the Body Snatchers.â€ This isnâ€™t so much a criticism of the movieâ€™s source material â€” Stephen Kingâ€™s paranoid and prophetic 2006 novel with the same title â€” as of a bare-bones screenplay (by Mr. King and Adam Alleca) thatâ€™s wholly unable to deliver even a smidgen of nuance or depth.Accordingly, unexplained events and unripened ideas simply accumulate as Clay (John Cusack), a graphic novelist, and Tom (Samuel L. Jackson), a phlegmatic railway worker, trek from Bostonâ€™s airport to somewhere in Maine. Having narrowly escaped a murderous mob of flesh eaters â€” the zombified victims of a mysterious cellphone signal â€” the pair (mobiles presumably on vibrate) must evade additional infected hordes en route to Clayâ€™s estranged wife and son. Thatâ€™s the sole hook on which our emotional investment in Clay hangs, and itâ€™s not nearly enough â€” as Mr. Cusack seems to know, giving possibly the most detached performance of his career.Even if it werenâ€™t cheap-looking and dreary, â€œCellâ€ would still be hobbled by an entertainment landscape already lousy with zombies, and a hive-mind premise that â€” at least metaphorically â€” has been all but realized.

"Donald Trump EXPOSES The Pope After Speech... Youll Love This [VIDEO] The liberal media has embraced Pope Francis with open arms during his visit to the United Statesprobably because everything he is saying mysteriously aligns with Obamas agenda. Presidential hopeful and legendary businessman Trump, however, is having none of it. I think his words are beautiful and I respect the Pope and I like the Pope very much, Trump claimed in an interview with CNN. I will say this: we have a country that is going through tremendous problems. We owe $19 trillion. So No. 1 we cant afford this process. Trump also addressed the Popes comments on climate change. He went on to insist that he is not a believer himself. Its called weather changes and you have storms and you have rain and you have beautiful days, he commented. What do you think?

"DETROIT â€” After two years of heavy legal and financial consequences, General Motors has finally turned the tide and started winning lawsuits related to the gravest safety crisis in its history.So far this year, G.M., the nationâ€™s largest automaker, has prevailed in three injury lawsuits, including a case dismissed on Friday, in ongoing litigation to resolve hundreds of remaining claims linked to its recall of 2.6 million small cars with faulty ignition switches.And in a critical fourth case involving a fatal accident, G.M. left nothing to chance in its effort to move past the ignition switch scandal â€” and settled the case last week before it could go to trial.It has all been part of G.M.â€™s methodical march to compensate victims, pay penalties and resolve claims stemming from its admission in 2014 that employees had known for a decade that faulty ignitions could suddenly cut engine power and disable airbags, often with tragic results.To date, the company has opened its checkbook and spent more than $2 billion settling claims, including at least 124 death cases, and paying fines to the Justice and Transportation Departments.In addition, it has poured billions more into overhauling its safety and engineering procedures, including recalling a record 30 million vehicles for various defects, after discovering the fatal flaw in its ignition switches.But now, G.M. is entering what it hopes will be the final phase of its legal quagmire.Two hundred and thirty-five outstanding death and injury claims have been consolidated in Federal District Court in New York, for the purposes of holding six so-called bellwether trials to set parameters for damages in various types of accidents.Unlike last year, when G.M. settled nearly 400 claims through a program administered by the compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg, the company is fighting some of the bellwether cases.The first case was dismissed in January after accusations by G.M. lawyers that the plaintiff had given misleading testimony. The company won a second case last month when a jury found that a faulty ignition was not responsible for a 2014 accident that injured two people.On Friday, a third bellwether case involving injuries was unexpectedly dismissed by plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers, giving G.M. another victory.The company said that it was prepared to go to trial in the case and argue that the ignition switch did not cause or contribute to the accident, which occurred in 2013 in Alabama.â€œWe have said all along that each case will be tried on its own merits and the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove they have valid claims,â€ said Patrick Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman.But in a fourth bellwether case, the automaker chose to avoid a trial that would have been its first involving a fatal accident in a car equipped with a defective ignition switch.Despite all the litigation stemming from the switches, G.M. has never had to defend itself in open court in a wrongful-death case. The closest it came was last year, when the company reached a confidential settlement in a Georgia case before it went to trial.Of the six bellwether cases, G.M. had the most to lose in the lawsuit filed by the wife of James Yingling, a 35-year-old Pennsylvania man who died when he lost control of his Saturn Ion in 2013.If it had lost the case, the size of a damage award would have been in the hands of a jury. Instead, G.M. surprised the plaintiffâ€™s lawyer with an offer of a confidential settlement.â€œI had just finished the 10th version of my opening statement just a few days before they called,â€ said the lawyer, Victor H. Pribanic. â€œWe were ready to go to trial.â€But rather than battling G.M. in a Manhattan courtroom, Mr. Pribanic huddled with company lawyers in Philadelphia to reach a settlement that was satisfactory for his client, Nadia Yingling.â€œI feel badly we did not get to try this case for all the people in the country who were watching this process,â€ Mr. Pribanic said. â€œBut you have to do the best thing for your client.â€G.M. has not commented on why it chose to settle the Yingling case. And the company is saying little about the two remaining injury cases left on the docket in the bellwether process, which should wrap up by the end of this year.",1

"FEMA camps and a new economy -- Is forced-labour the last hope of the Western elites? Writing ContestMick McNulty Back in the 1970s when some corporate and manufacturing interests first moved their production facilities to the Far East to increase profits through lower wages and poorer safety conditions, anybody who could analyse the economics and think ahead could see this would ultimately lead to the end of the Western economy and the primacy of the East. Ironic, really, when we remember how from childhood our rulers often warned us about the dangers of communism; while some strands of Western thinking like socialism or kibbutzism borrowed parts from communist ideology, capitalism went over there and bought it. Those in the highest echelons of financial and political planning must have known this was a mistake regarding the security of our future production capabilities and our assured self-sufficiency (one definition of autarky). Though they knew this was the case they still continued, because the money was just too good. Lets give it another year, eh..? Then another. And now here we are just a few decades later, not only the toiling classes who are poorer but many of the professional classes also. Now our leaders tell us austerity is the only way out of this mess which they created, but having caused it their measures are not going to cure it. They will send us spinning faster down the plughole, and only another economic system can save us. Our rulers may have found another system which would serve their interests, but rob us of ours. Their only hope now to return production to the West and compete against Eastern markets at a profit while avoiding prohibitive or everyday costs, is to introduce a system which pays for goods and services but which does not pay for labour. Nobody who is able to earn a living will volunteer his labour or craft or time at no charge, so while some can be coerced into working for nothing such as those in custody or those without any other source of income, everybody else the able-bodied at least may have to be forced into doing so. In a new economic model those who have skills can be reclassified as unskilled. A doctor who can open a private surgery for the wealthy can escape forced-labor but a nurse who used to work on the same hospital ward, caring for the hoi-polloi, probably could not. The well-being of the hoi-polloi is of little concern to the elite, and so therefore are our nurses. Apart from those who have specialist skills or licences with a high market value such as engineers or train drivers, the market value of the rest of us would be very low for sure. Factor in other living costs such as a minimal balanced diet and typical care like clothing and a bed, dental treatment and glasses, you may soon become too expensive to keep when compared to your projected lifetime earnings. It should be remembered that though today there are sectors of the economy which cater for those of low incomes such as cheap-brand foods and clothing, these sectors will end if workers are no longer paid. Only the wealthy will have purchasing power by earning whatever is the next medium of exchange perhaps a system of gold and silver coin or specie, with fewer high-demonination notes that may hold a value and there will be no assembly-line furniture for them. Only craftsmen need apply. A system of hundreds of camps would from conception be planned to provide for every need of this new economy. Some would be work camps, others prison camps, others for military and security training, but many would be there for the benefit of, and perhaps funded by, major sectors of the economy. With little oversight these could become places of live experimentation in fields like medicine and test-engineering. If they want to know if their new ejector-seat will save the pilot, stick a pleb in it and see. It may well be that in some of these camps it wont be grown men and women they want. Maybe we are the last thing their Commanding Officers want? Perhaps it is our kids theyll be after? Youngsters of seven or eight dont have enough life-experiences to organise themselves into collectives and to all intents and purposes each would be alone. Theyll be there to be moulded for a few hours a day in carefully structured education and fitness classes with lots of tests and assessments and for the rest of the day, maybe for up to eight hours, they can be made to produce or pack goods to meet some military or elite demand. Those who are meek but aware will be ideal for domestic serfdom, which will be preferred by many to escape the regimentation of the barracks and any sacrifices that follow. In these camps the perimeter guards would have their guns pointing not in at the kids but out at the parents, and there are more people than wed care to imagine who would wear one or other uniform to ensure the workforce does just as its told. Their job would feed the kids and pay the landlord, while the brutally of a taskmaster will come with familiarity. Very soon. Such a camp system wouldnt have to be extensive forever. After ten or twenty years (a generation?), many camps will have fulfilled their initial functions of cheap production, youth indoctrination and selection; and the unchosen ones locked outside to die out through whatever results from devastation. Its cheap to let people die that way. You dont have to feed, clothe or house them. The first group to perish will likely be those who no longer have their life-saving treatments, by which time the suicides should have caught up. Many people will be killed over food and other useful possessions and the weak will disappear fast. Still more will be killed in the leaderless society as old differences between the tribes resurface in an attempt to take control of societys direction as it organises to survive outside the camps. New politics. New elites. Many coups. Far-right movements will have been absorbed into the private security system and will enjoy coming under the Federal wing with their own branch of the government, able to influence decisions made in boardrooms which used to be voted on by Congress. Theyll be glad to exchange their Doc Martens for jackboots and become the privateers enforcers, while their old enemy the leftists are left to battle amongst themselves; the Leninists away to the Trotskyists while the Stalinists are at home to Mao. Guards will form new chapters of the Klan and organise weekend torching parties. The Christian Fundamentalists will be off on crusade looking out for Mulims, while the lapsed-Hebrews are trying to find out what both sides are looking most to buy. The Chinese will fight the Vietnamese as the Hells Angels ride hog to hunt down other biker gangs, while the Mob and the Triads wont leave much left of each other. No wonder if so many people may turn to the camps but this system will say, Do not feed those mouths! The coffins may be for those of us outside. Even the greedy know resources have to be spent on disposing of large numbers of dead because decay breeds diseases like salmonella and botulism which would be spread by the pestilence that would flourish. As those outside the camps finally perish, with the last few survivors picked off by drones and security patrols after a decade or so, those chosen to live by this new totalitarian regime a son or daughter now in early adulthood, many whose parents would not recognise them if they were described by new capabilities alone will be aware of their choices.

"Hereâ€™s something unthinkable. Imagine if Rick and the gang donâ€™t rise up and waste Negan and the Saviours. According to TV dramaâ€™s narrative algorithms, pride comes before a fall, evil gets its comeuppance, vengeance is virtueâ€™s reward and, before weâ€™re done with season seven, Negan should get his head spliced by Michonneâ€™s katana shortly after Rick insists that he, crypto-sexually, eats Lucille, his barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat.  How refreshing it would be if The Walking Dead broke the rules rather than its most captivating villainâ€™s cranium. My money says the show wonâ€™t dare.  Rather, us viewers want â€“ donâ€™t we? â€“ Rick and his crew to get their violent mojo back. We want a Hollywood ending that redeems our pain at witnessing this parade of diminishment â€“ Rickâ€™s hangdog look, broken Eugeneâ€™s unwillingness to leave Alexandria, the unacceptably, un-American stink of defeat. We want there to be sense to this dramatic tension. We want blood. Why? Because the drama of enfeeblement is unbearable. At the start Rick and Michonne woke in a sunny bed, the apparent image of conjugal bliss. Near the end, they were making up a bed without a mattress. In the intervening period, Negan and the Saviours had paid a visit. Humming Wagnerâ€™s Ride of the Valkyries (that aural index of the American nut job since Robert Duvall used it as the soundtrack to the napalming of a Vietnamese village in Apocalypse Now), Negan arrived to get his share of Alexandriaâ€™s bounty â€“ guns, a deer for dinner, even the mattresses. â€œHot diggity dog!â€ he exclaimed, leering at Rick and twitching his leather-clad torso like a mashup of James Dean and Elvis. â€œAn embarrassment of riches, as they say. Yes, I do believe you are going to have plenty to offer up.â€    We want blood â€¦ will Rick and his crew get payback down the line? Photograph: Gene Page/AMC   Along with his gang of goons, Negan had brought the apparently hobbled Daryl along to rub Rick deeper in his humiliation. We hope that, like the seemingly mad Edgar in King Lear, Daryl is just shamming â€“ and that he will, like the Shakespearean dissembler, cast off his mask and take out the evil trash. But at the moment, it seems unlikely.  â€œMercy for the lost. Vengeance for the plunderers.â€ So said the sign at Alexandria, the once proud boast of a civilisation amid post-apocalyptic barbarism. This episode undermined the latter commandment, as Rick handed over all the guns he could find for Negan. But there was a problem. Oliviaâ€™s inventory disclosed that two handguns were missing. And so, Negan ruled that Olivia must die unless the weapons were found, then revealed his compunctions: â€œI donâ€™t enjoy killing women. Men? I can waste them all the livelong day.â€ But he would do it. And so Rick searched for the last guns in Alexandria to save Olivia. He found them under Spencerâ€™s floorboards and handed them over. He even convinced Michonne to turn in her rifle. Michonne complied, then handed over a deer carcass to sweeten the deal. â€œMan,â€ drooled Negan into Rickâ€™s ear, â€œI love a gal that buys you dinner and doesnâ€™t ask you to put out.â€     â€˜You see this? This is the kind of thing that just tickles my ballsâ€™ â€¦ Negan, one of TVâ€™s most cruel and compelling villains. Photograph: Gene Page/AMC   How could Rick bend the knee so low? â€œWe play by their rules and we get some kind of a life,â€ he told Michonne afterwards. â€œWhat kind of life?â€ she asked. Rick explained that, in the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, his wife Lori thought he was dead and so had an affair with his police partner Shane. Together they conceived a daughter, Judith. Then Rick showed up and, after a little â€“ ahem! â€“ awkwardness, Shane stepped aside and Lori and Rick renewed their nuptial arrangements. Then Judith was born and passed off as his daughter, even though he knew she wasnâ€™t. Now both Lori and Shane are dead and Rick has to raise Judith as his own. He told Michonne: â€œI will die before her and I hope thatâ€™s a long time so I can raise her and protect her and teach her to survive. Thatâ€™s how we live now.â€ Pragmatic survival instead of martial heroism. As Rick told a meeting of Alexandrians, he wasnâ€™t their leader now, Negan was.  As for Michonne, she told Rick she would try to live the way he suggested, a life of mere survival under Neganâ€™s eviscerating rule.  But, we suspect, not so very hard. At the beginning of the episode, she was using a walker as target practice, trying to shoot him with that rifle. But her aim proved hopeless and she was compelled to dispatch him with her sword. Now, she has no rifle â€“ perhaps, then, the moral is that the Alexandrians donâ€™t need guns to overcome the Saviours (and the shot of the zombieâ€™s sliced head in the grass was reprised at the end as if to clinch the point).     There are hopeful signs for the future â€¦ Rosita, who found a gun then asked Eugene to make a bullet. Photograph: Gene Page/AMC   There are other hopeful signs for those who yearn for payback down the line. The look Rosita gave Dwight when he â€“ pettily, cruelly â€“ emptied her water bottle. The gun she found near Darylâ€™s motorbike in the woods. The bullet she asked Eugene to make. Carlâ€™s coltish reaction to one of Neganâ€™s goons taking more than his share. The way Rick chewed out Spencer: â€œSay anything like that to me again and Iâ€™ll break your jaw and knock your teeth out.â€ We havenâ€™t heard Rick so angry for a while, and it was good to hear. To be fair, Spencer had said the unthinkable, namely that Glenn and Abraham â€“ slain by Negan in the season premiere â€“ were lucky. Lucky, presumably, to be dead and so not witness Alexandriaâ€™s abjection. Most of all, there was the freshly dug but empty grave in Alexandria. It was dug to trick Negan into believing that Maggie, presumably along with her unborn child, had died. Nice dissembling on the part of Seth Gilliamâ€™s superbly slimy Father Gabriel. The Alexandrians arenâ€™t playing quite by Neganâ€™s rules, and may yet outwit him.     Superbly slimy â€¦ Father Gabriel. Photograph: Gene Page/AMC   At Maggieâ€™s grave, Negan delivered his lubricous lament: â€œDamn tragedy. Thatâ€™s what this is. This must really suck for you guys â€¦ Damn I was going to ask her to come back with me. Oh I know what youâ€™re thinking â€“ how could I have a shot? Guy that just bashed her husbandâ€™s head in? Youâ€™d be surprised.â€ His aim, you see, was to capitalise sexually on a widowâ€™s grief and add her to his polygamous collection. One of TVâ€™s most compelling villains is thoughtful like that.  But where is Maggie? And if sheâ€™s really alive, is she still pregnant? The biggest mystery of all in this episode, though, was what made Michonne cry. Smoke was rising beyond the trees and she went to investigate. If this blog had a bigger budget, Iâ€™d have enlisted air crash investigators or CSI Georgia to explain what the rubble she found was. Why was there no sound of a crash or detonation? Why did the sight upset Michonne? Most likely that rubble is not a downed plane, nor the smouldering wreck of Alexandriaâ€™s hopes, but Walking Dead McGuffin, designed to keep us watching next week.   Unpleasantness, Negan style â€œYou see this? This is the kind of thing that just tickles my balls.â€ Negan salivating over the booty he planned to haul from Alexandria. â€œWidows, especially ones who look like that, they are special. I love â€˜em. Right after their husbands go, they are just empty inside. But usually not for long! Hur, hur, hur.â€ Negan, explaining what he planned to do with Maggie and why he likes to put his moves on the recently bereaved. â€œExcuse the shit out of my goddamned French, but did you just try to threaten me?â€ Negan to Carl. â€œIn case you didnâ€™t know what was going on, I just slipped my dick down your throat and you thanked me for it.â€ Neganâ€™s parting shot to Rick, explaining the significance of his visit to Alexandria.",1
"Amyann Darden believes Ronald Reagan was Americaâ€™s last great president. This election, sheâ€™s voting for Hillary Clinton.  Darden, 55, used to manage an accounting firm. But her life changed after a nervous breakdown. Now relying on social security, she was forced to leave her Seattle apartment when the rent went from $950 to $1,450 a month. Sheâ€™s been staying outdoors at Tent City 3, an encampment operated by homeless residents, while trying to save for a rental deposit. Over the last year, Portland, Seattle and the state of Hawaii have declared a state of emergency on homelessness, with other cities considering it. But in the presidential election, the issue is receiving minimal political attention. At homeless camps Hazelnut Grove in Portland and Tent City 3 in Seattle, the issues that led people to become homeless reflect on the issues facing many voters this election: soaring rent, debt, access to healthcare, discrimination. We asked several camp residents for their thoughts. Amyann Darden, 55: â€˜Retaining social security is an important issue to meâ€™    Amyann Darden in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   I was going to vote Republican but when I watched the convention and saw what Trump stood for, I thought, â€œNo way.â€ His platformâ€™s based on hatred and fear. Iâ€™m horrified that some of my friends still support him.   Related: Seen and not heard: homeless people absent from election even as ranks grow   So Iâ€™m voting for Hillary. Retaining social security is an important issue to me. I worked for 30 years and paid into it and then became disabled. Iâ€™m very afraid it will be phased out during a Trump presidency. I was staying in motel rooms before I came to Tent City. I use my sonâ€™s address for everything; heâ€™s in community living as he has schizophrenia. My ballot will be going there. I want to stay in Seattle to be close to my children and grandchildren. My daughter doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m at the camp. She has a lot of money and has helped me pay off some medical bills to raise my credit score and I donâ€™t want to ask for further help right now; eventually I will be disabled to a point where I will need care and Iâ€™ll need to ask then. Zoe White, 34: â€˜Iâ€™ll probably vote for Jill Steinâ€™    Zoe White in Portland. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Iâ€™ve voted every year Iâ€™ve been eligible. Generally Green or Socialist, sometimes Democrat. Iâ€™ll probably vote for Jill Stein this year. Thereâ€™s no representation of ecologists, left causes or democratic socialism anywhere else. I see Hillary Clinton as having a liberal wrapper around a traditionalist core. I donâ€™t know whose interests sheâ€™s going to sell out to, but Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s going to sell out. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary election. Now heâ€™s telling people to vote for Hillary; Iâ€™m disappointed in him. There are many misconceptions of houseless people. First of all, that we donâ€™t work â€“ we do. I had a job for a long time at a country club. I would say through that Iâ€™ve been subject to employment discrimination as a female whoâ€™s trans. There are also the insinuations that weâ€™re lazy, use drugs, weâ€™re all thieves. In Hazelnut Grove, where Iâ€™m lucky enough to live, weâ€™re an intentional community. If you steal from someone, youâ€™re run the hell out. Here thereâ€™s the idea that if you put into the community, the community reciprocates. I feel like that type of culture is being squeezed out during the gentrification process [of Portland]. Property values are taking precedence over community. Andrew Constantino, 41: â€˜I have to watch the train wreckâ€™    Andrew Constantino in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Iâ€™m voting for Hillary. On her own merits, sheâ€™s committed to social issues and doing good. I would never even consider voting for Trump. But I have to watch the train wreck; I cannot stop myself. Some people think anyone getting government assistance automatically votes liberal, but thatâ€™s absolutely not true. You hear all these Trump lovers here. I try telling them, â€œDo you realize heâ€™s the type of person who doesnâ€™t care about anything thatâ€™s ever happened to you?â€ But itâ€™s like being with your family at Thanksgiving; you try avoiding those conversations because they go nowhere. Iâ€™ve lived in Seattle for almost 20 years. Itâ€™s become more and more expensive to survive. When my girlfriend and I lost our jobs very close together, we burned through our savings. Weâ€™re both working full time again, but itâ€™s just that there are no good options. I refuse to pay some exorbitant amount of rent to live in absolute poverty. Iâ€™d rather do this until thereâ€™s a reasonable option. Roxy Garske, 58: â€˜I donâ€™t trust Hillary after the emailsâ€™    Roxy Garske in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Iâ€™m voting for Gary Johnson because heâ€™s not one of the other two. I donâ€™t like Hillary because I donâ€™t believe what she says; I donâ€™t trust her after the emails. I think sheâ€™s too rightwing. Sheâ€™s more interested in the needs of the rich and powerful. If I could only vote between her and Trump, Iâ€™d choose her. The thought of him winning scares me, especially for women. Iâ€™ve got two daughters and two granddaughters. If heâ€™s voted in, heâ€™ll turn back the clock. Heâ€™s already stirring up trouble by getting people worried about immigrants. None of the candidates are addressing homelessness. Itâ€™s an invisible society. Lots of people here donâ€™t know they can vote. But when we had a voter drive, around 30 people registered and were excited to find they could vote. I have peripheral neuropathy and spinal stenosis. This is the second time Iâ€™ve been homeless. About five years ago, my husband said, â€œIâ€™m going to get stuck taking care of you.â€ He said he wanted a divorce, which is fine. I was homeless while I waited for the settlement but then I got a house. I had to go into hospital and while I was very unwell; I lost my house. It went into foreclosure in July. I stayed with friends but theyâ€™ve got some other people staying there now, but Iâ€™m going back when theyâ€™re gone. Iâ€™m just here for a month. Marvin Ross, 56: â€˜A woman will be better off running the countryâ€™    Marvin Ross in Portland. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Donald Trump is not important to me. Heâ€™s not down for the people. Heâ€™s got all this money so he doesnâ€™t care what happens to the United States. I donâ€™t see how being president is important to him. Why would he want to step down? I think a woman will be better off running the country than a man anyway. Look at how long men have run this country and how theyâ€™ve messed it up. I havenâ€™t always voted but when I have, itâ€™s been Democrat. Right now, Iâ€™m living in a big tent. Iâ€™ve got a real bed. My clothes on hangers. All my CDs. Iâ€™m here for the long term. Iâ€™m building my own tiny house; Iâ€™m just waiting for more wood. Iâ€™ve never built a house before; Iâ€™m learning from watching others. Iâ€™ve got a criminal background for drug possession that keeps me from renting. But Iâ€™ve never tried to rent. Iâ€™ve lived with girlfriends and family members. I came here to be alone. Lori Perry, 39: â€˜If I donâ€™t vote, Iâ€™ve got no right to bitchâ€™    Lori Perry in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   I donâ€™t think about politics much. My priorities are spending time with my husband, getting away from the camp, my kids and grandkids. Mostly what goes through my head is flashbacks. I looked the candidates up on Google once. I canâ€™t really do news. Whatâ€™s happening in front of me right now, today, is what matters. But itâ€™s still important to me to cast my vote because if I donâ€™t vote, Iâ€™ve got no right to bitch. I want to vote for Bernie Sanders, so Iâ€™m going to write his name in. If I had to choose between Trump and Clinton, Iâ€™d choose Trump because Iâ€™m not sure about a woman having that much control yet. I respect Trump because heâ€™s built everything from nothing. But I donâ€™t think heâ€™s the right guy for the job. Itâ€™s all kind of confusing in my head. I moved my husband and myself here in July. He has Parkinsonâ€™s and this is where he gets treated. We came from Alaska where we could get housing but we were in drugs real bad. We were doing marijuana and meth. We canâ€™t afford rent here but if we return, I know heâ€™ll go right back to it. Heâ€™s angry at me for keeping us homeless. But weâ€™re doing good. Weâ€™ve been sober since July. I still drink once in a while. We got a room on Monday and I got six beers. Cierra Discher, 30: â€˜Iâ€™m voting for Trumpâ€™    Cierra Discher in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Iâ€™m voting for Trump. A woman in charge is probably not what we need. But I donâ€™t know anything about it. Iâ€™ve got bigger fish to fry. It really doesnâ€™t affect my immediate life. I mean if somebody else was president, would I still be sitting here? Probably. But I hear itâ€™s better to vote for the wrong person than not at all. And Iâ€™m registered. Last night was my first night on the streets. I slept behind a building. This will be my first night at Tent City 3 â€“ theyâ€™ve just given me a tent. I was staying at my boyfriendâ€™s but I found out he was Mexican drug mafia. I left while he was at work and went to a hotel for two days. I used meth yesterday so Iâ€™m pretty emotional. Iâ€™m about to go into treatment. Iâ€™ve waited two months for that and hopefully it will get me on my feet. My ballot will go to my momâ€™s house. We donâ€™t talk but I go to hers on the 10th of every month and she leaves me my mail. Leashia McDaniels, 24: â€˜None of my friends voteâ€™    Leashia McDaniels in Portland. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Iâ€™m not registered to vote. Politics has always seemed kind of boring to me. I donâ€™t feel like it has an effect on my life. None of my friends vote. My momâ€™s side was more Republican but I donâ€™t think she votes any more. I donâ€™t know anything about my dadâ€™s side. From what Iâ€™ve heard of Donald Trump, heâ€™s an ass. I donâ€™t know too much about Hillary Clinton. I became homeless three years ago. I got kicked out of my momâ€™s house because her boyfriend didnâ€™t approve of the relationship I was in. I started using meth and kept on it for almost two years. Iâ€™ve been at Hazelnut Grove since March. Being here has kept me clean. A lot of people have helped and supported me. If I was somewhere else Iâ€™d be back where I was a year ago. Iâ€™m usually pretty much a loner; Iâ€™ve never been much of a people person. But Iâ€™m learning to get along with people better now. Joseph â€˜Tequilaâ€™ Gordon, 36: â€˜This earth is our home but homeâ€™s going to dieâ€™    Joseph Gordon in Portland. Photograph: Annabel Clark   Climate change is my number one issue. This earth is our home but homeâ€™s going to die. And weâ€™re stuck on what? Bathrooms? Bernie Sanders was addressing the issues I was concerned with. He kept Hillary on her toes and changed her focus. I donâ€™t see her as a leader, though. I donâ€™t have anyone to vote for but Iâ€™m still sending in the ballot. I always vote. My motherâ€™s white and my father was black. She always told us society is going to treat us black. Sheâ€™d say: â€œThe way your people have been treated? Youâ€™re going to vote.â€ If thereâ€™s a protest, Iâ€™m there. I used to protest by myself in Cincinnati, where Iâ€™m from. My first protest was in sixth grade to stop the drilling in Antarctica. Iâ€™d watched something on PBS about it. I tried to join the International Socialist Organization when they started a chapter there. But it was pretty bougie. Theyâ€™d complain about the problems, then go to a coffee shop to buy a $7 latte, walking past a homeless person on the way out. I love Portland. The people are awesome. But thereâ€™s not enough housing for the population. And the housing policies are causing a lot of houselessness. Like no-cause evictions [in which a landlord can terminate a contract for no reason with 30 daysâ€™ notice] and the applications fee you have to pay every time you apply to rent somewhere. Some landlords keep a place vacant to take in lots of fees. Cody, 24, and Isaiah, 25: â€˜We would go back to the dark ages with Trumpâ€™    Cody and Isaiah in Seattle. Photograph: Annabel Clark   [Cody Bowen] Hillaryâ€™s seen how people who are homeless are living. Sheâ€™s helped non-profits that work with people in our situation. Trumpâ€™s attitude is more like, â€œIf you donâ€™t have money, youâ€™re not worth anything.â€   Related: Wealthy San Francisco tech investors bankroll bid to ban homeless camps   I was 16 when I first became homeless. It was because of my life choices, being homosexual. I come from a Southern Baptist family, where my father is a preacher and a chaplain in the army. I came home one day and heâ€™d bought me a Greyhound ticket to Arizona, left my stuff on the front porch and changed the locks. [Isaiah Thomas] Iâ€™m voting for Hillary primarily to keep Trump out of office. I read that heâ€™s planning on supporting supreme court candidates who want to overturn the marriage equality bill, which weâ€™re planning on taking advantage of ourselves pretty soon. I never really cared much before about politics but as Iâ€™ve got older and realized how it affects our lives, Iâ€™ve started paying attention. Weâ€™ve come a long way in American society and I think we would go back to the dark ages with Trump.",1
"Device Can Disable Car and Boat Engines 50 Meters Away in Under 3 SecondsMadison Ruppert Devices capable of remotely disabling electronics are nothing new, given that devices capable of remotely disabling phones, intercepting communications and tracking targets have been around for years. However, this is one of the first publicly unveiled devices capable of remotely disabling a wide range of vehicle engines. The device, dubbed RF Safe-Stop, produced by e2v, weighs around 771 pounds and is reportedly aimed at stopping vehicles suspected of being used as car bombs, according to The Engineer. RF Safe-Stop was first shown at DSEI 2013, dubbed the world leading defense and security event in September. The device typically causes engines to shut down in less than one second, without destroying the target engine. So far, the unit has been tested on a Nissan Nevara and Toyota Land Cruiser, but Andy Wood, product manager for e2v, told The Engineer that it can also be used on a variety of other platforms. It can be fitted into fixed-base installations, rib-type boats and there are plans to integrate it into a helicopter, The Engineer reports. RF Safe-Stop works by generate powerful radio frequency pulses which confuse a vehicles electronics and make them temporarily inoperable, according to Wood. Basically the ECU (engine control unit) or immobilizeronce affected, will try and reset, Wood said. As long as you keep it confused the engine wont restart. The system is designed to be able to be used many times without running out of power and does not require any special training to use. The company is aiming for a system that that allows the user to do nothing more complicated than push a red button when the target is in range, according to The Engineer. So far, 17 countries and five government bodies in the United Kingdom have already expressed interest in the system. Wood said that orders for the system will probably be taken in the coming weeks and that their system can be tailored for the requirements of the particular agency that is placing the order. One must wonder how safe this would really be, especially on a car like a Prius that contains sensitive electronics systems that control everything the car does.

"Greenlanders go to the polls Tuesday to elect members of the local parliament with surveys predicting a major win for a pro-independence opposition party in the Danish territory. The polls come as Greenland prepares for its new self-rule status that takes effect in three weeks, paving the way for independence and giving the island rights to lucrative Arctic resources. Public opinion polls have suggested the pro-independence opposition party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) could oust the social democratic Siumut party from power after 30 years in government. The head of Greenland's local government, Hans Enoksen of the Siumut party, called the snap election in April, six months ahead of schedule. He said it was appropriate to ask voters whom they would like to see lead Greenland 'into this new era'. A vast majority of Greenlanders, 75.5 percent, voted 'yes' to greater autonomy in a referendum held in November 2008. The self-rule status, which enters into force on June 21, will also grant Greenland control over justice and police affairs and, to a certain extent, foreign affairs. With its 2.1 million square kilometre (840,000 square mile) surface, 80 percent of which is covered by ice, Greenland is the world's largest island and contains 10 percent of the world's fresh water reserves. Independence has grown especially important due to the potentially lucrative revenues from natural resources under Greenland's seabed and icecap, which according to international experts is home to large oil and gas deposits as well as diamonds, gold and other minerals. Melting ice in the Arctic owing to climate change could make the region more accessible to exploration in the future. The IA party, which served in a coalition government with Siumut until 2007, was seen winning 44 percent of votes, almost double its score of 23 percent in the 2005 elections, according to a recent poll. That score would dethrone Siumut as the biggest party. According to political observers, voters are expected to punish Siumut for its perceived abuses of power after a slew of scandals. It was seen losing three percentage points to 28 percent, while its coalition partner, the liberal Atassut party, would lose more than half of its support to 9.0 percent. Greenland, an island of 57,000 inhabitants, is rife with social problems, such as alcoholism, and one in three children is a victim of domestic violence and has bad living conditions. Hospital waiting lists are lengthy, the gap is growing between the rich and the poor, and corruption scandals have made headlines of late. Following the lead of the British media, the local AG newspaper recently revealed 'the extravagances of the elite', sparking an uproar among the Greenlandic public. AG exposed Siumut officials' expenses abuses, including dinners with family and friends, trips and furniture all paid for with taxpayer money. Enoksen has been accused of spending 1,400 kroner (190 euros, 265 dollars) on a meal with his wife at a Copenhagen restaurant, an expense he insisted was a 'meeting on the sick people in Greenland'. Polling stations open at 9:00 am (1100 GMT) and close at 8:00 pm (2200 GMT). Preliminary results are expected around midnight (0200 GMT Wednesday). ",1
"The singer Adele has revealed she would be happy if she never had to tour again, in an interview that also covered her long battle with depression and what she described as her â€œvery dark sideâ€. The multi-Grammy Award winning songwriter said she would continue to make music, but was content to lose out on lucrative live tours and never to appear on stage again. She told Vanity Fair magazine: â€œIâ€™d still like to make records, but Iâ€™d be fine if I never heard [the applause] again. Iâ€™m on tour simply to see everyone whoâ€™s been so supportive. I donâ€™t care about money.â€   Related: Adele soars back to the top of the charts after Glastonbury set   The 10-time Grammy winning musician, whose hits include Someone Like You and Rolling in the Deep, is nearing the end of a 10-month tour with her album, 25. Adele told the magazine that the death of her grandfather when she was a child sparked her depression and that she had undergone therapy to tackle the illness. The 28-year-old, born Adele Adkins in Tottenham, north London, also spoke of having postnatal depression after the birth of her son, Angelo, four. She is quoted in the December issue as saying: â€œI have a very dark side. Iâ€™m very available to depression. I can slip in and out of it quite easily. â€œIt started when my grandad died, when I was about 10, and while I never had a suicidal thought, I have been in therapy, lots. â€œBut I havenâ€™t had that feeling since I had my son and snapped out of my postpartum depression,â€ she added. â€œI had really bad postpartum depression after I had my son, and it frightened me.     Adele endorses Hillary Clinton for presidency â€“ video  â€œMy knowledge of postpartum â€“ or postnatal, as we call it in England â€“ is that you donâ€™t want to be with your child; youâ€™re worried you might hurt your child; youâ€™re worried you werenâ€™t doing a good job. â€œBut I was obsessed with my child. I felt very inadequate; I felt like Iâ€™d made the worst decision of my life. It can come in many different forms.â€ Adele said any future songs were unlikely to match those she wrote for her 2011 album, 21, which has sold more than 31m copies worldwide. She said: â€œI can see from an outsiderâ€™s perspective that I will never write songs as good as the ones that are on 21, but Iâ€™m not as indulgent as I was then, and I donâ€™t have time to fall apart like I did then. â€œI was completely off my face writing that album, and a drunk tongue is an honest one.â€ Since the birth of her son, Adele said she had stopped smoking and now drank less â€“ just a couple of glasses of wine a week.",1
"Twitter and Privacy: 1-in-5 Tweets Divulge User LocationUSC researcher creates app that lets you test your own location footprint. Hashtag #doyouknowwhoswatchingyou? A new study from USC researchers sampled more than 15 million tweets, showing that some Twitter users may be inadvertently revealing their location through updates on the social media channel. The study, which appears in the current issue of the International Journal of Geoinformatics, provides important factual data for a growing national conversation about online privacy and third-party commercial or government use of geo-tagged information. Im a pretty private person, and I wish others would be more cautious with the types of information they share, said lead author Chris Weidemann, a graduate student in the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIST) online masters program at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. There are all sorts of information that can be gleaned from things outside of the tweet itself. Twitter has approximately 500 million active users, who are expected to tweet 72 billion times in 2013. Reports have shown that about 6 percent of users opt-in to allow the platform to broadcast their location with every tweet. But thats only part of the footprint Twitter users leave, and even users who have not opted-in for location tagging may be inadvertently revealing where they are, the study shows. To get a fuller sense of what publicly accessible data might reveal about Twitter users, Weidemann developed an application called Twitter2GIS, to analyze the metadata collected by Twitter, including details about the users hometown, time zone and language. During the one-week sampling period of the study, roughly 20 percent of the tweets collected showed the users location to an accuracy of street level or better. Many Twitter users divulged their physical location directly through active location monitoring or GPS coordinates. But another 2.2 percent of all tweets equating to about 4.4 million tweets a day provided so-called ambient location data, where the user might not be aware that they are divulging their location. The downside is that mining this kind of information can also provide opportunities for criminal misuse of data, Weidemann said. My intent is to educate social media users and inform the public about their privacy. In addition to being a graduate student at USC, Weidemann works for a company that builds geographic information systems for the federal government. He initially developed Twitter2GIS as part of a capstone project for a course taught by Jennifer Swift, associate teaching professor of spatial sciences at USC. Swift, Weidemanns thesis adviser, said the project stood out for its thoughtful look at geospatial information: It will help create an awareness among the general population about the information they divulge, said Swift, a co-author on the study. Weidemann is a self-described conservative Twitter user, using the social media channel infrequently. He has the privacy set to not share any location information about his tweets. Still, in the course of doing this study, he turned Twitter2GIS on his own account and was surprised at the specificity the application was able to find about his location, based on a hashtag he used about an academic conference. This research has been fun, Weidemann said. And a little scary. ### Weidemann is opening up Twitter2GIS to the public, expanding it to allow Twitter users to login in with their profile credentials so they can view their own location footprint. Test out the beta version and provide feedback at http://geosocialfootprint.com.

"Following a nearly four-year period in which he was, by all accounts, living at the very peak of his existence, 26-year-old Brian Koning unknowingly entered the final 168 hours of his heyday Monday. Koning unwittingly enjoys his seventh-to-last day at the top of his game. Koning began his current halcyon days on June 23, 2005, when he moved into a loft apartment in Chicago with three old friends from high school. Since then, the Ohio University alum's daily routine has been a series of generally satisfying social interactions and life experiences thatbeginning Monday at approximately 10:35 a.m.he will forever look back upon with a pained sense of nostalgia. 'I'm having a blast,' Koning recently said to a friend, oblivious to the next three decades of work stress and financial responsibilities that will one day lead him to resent ever having been this happy. 'Work's great, life's great, I'm going out every nightI can't imagine things being better than this.' Although Koning claimed that he had a 'super-tight' group of friends who would be part of his life 'forever,' sources reported that his two closest buddies will soon respectively enroll in a masters program at Berkeley and accept a computer programming job in Denver, causing their bonds of friendship to slowly dissolve over the next five years. According to a number of erroneous statements Koning has made in the dwindling weeks of his prime, his romantic situation also appears promising. 'I really think Tracy and I might have a future together,' Koning said of 27-year-old Tracy Krupman, whom he will soon marry on an emotional whim, and toward whom he will become incresingly embittered and even hateful over the next decade. 'We have a real connection, and I think our best times are yet to come.' 'And I'm really starting to settle into Chicago,' continued Koning, who in three months will be forced to move to Tacoma, WA in order to care for Krupman's ailing father. 'I can totally see myself becoming one of those 'Chicago guys' who lives here for the rest of his life. I love it out here.' While evidence suggests that Koning could conceivably prolong his life's pinnacle for another one or two years by leaving Krupman and following his dream of opening a trading cards and collectibles shop, the likelihood of this ever occurring is thought to be incredibly small. Koning, who currently fills his weekends with volunteer work, regular exercise, and recreational travel, will reportedly soon be granted a minor promotion that will demand all of his free time without providing any additional satisfaction. He is then expected to begin a gradual slide into unfulfilling 60-hour work weeks highlighted by the occasional halfway decent nap. 'Things are finally looking up for me,' Koning said in a poignantly inaccurate statement to his mother during a recent phone conversation. 'All the hard stuff is behind me, and I feel like it's time to kick back and just enjoy myself. You know, really start living.' While social scientists believe heydays can last anywhere from one month to several decadesand may in some cases occur intermittentlyKoning's personal apex is believed to be a fluke event that has no chance of recurring. 'The period of time that will come to be known as Mr. Koning's 'glory days' has actually exceeded the national average by more than six months,' said Dr. Thomas Washam of the Brown University Department of Human Behavior. 'Taking into account a number of variables, including the current financial markets and his father's hairline, I believe this young man should feel very lucky to have had his good run last as long as it did. Instead, he will most likely live out the rest of his life in a state of slowly mounting sadness and regret.' Koning, who is currently training for an upcoming triathlon, has remained blissfully unaware of the fact that he will soon injure his left knee, leading to persistent, lifelong pain that will make it difficult for him to play with his children, who will all grow up to despise him.

"With the safety of 8.6 million people to maintain and more than 45,000 officers, support officers and staff to manage, the first question is: why would anyone want to be the commissioner of police of the metropolis? The working hours are terrible, the pressures are immense, and they will have to spend time in the company of politicians and solicitors. Despite this, there are sure to be several applicants battling it out for the position.   Related: Who should be the next Metropolitan police commissioner? | Duncan Campbell   The new boss will face many challenges, including the growing London population versus the diminishing frontline. These are times of austerity, and you can bet the winning candidate will have to promise to deliver gold standards for tin prices. That is always a difficult vision to pitch to a workforce. The danger of terrorism in the capital is always at the forefront of decision-making and ultimately requires a huge amount of money and resources. This is not an area of policing where there can be compromise, but then, what is? Every public report or inquiry states the police must do more, invest more, place more emphasis, dedicate more resources and so on to whatever the hot topic of the report might be. This is usually accompanied by a quote from someone with a political agenda mixed with little real-life knowledge of the issue. Rarely does the Met reply include the issues of lack of resources. Instead, the reply will consider the message of the current governing party and City Hall. The Met message will not consider rank-and-file officers. It will not mention the budget cuts already borne against a growing anti-police rhetoric in the media â€“ which most officers blame on the inability of the police, as an organisation, to engage with the media in a direct and open way. Everyone respects a straight-talking copper, even if they donâ€™t agree with the message being delivered. Your basic street cop lives between a rock and a hard place. They see the increase in knife crime, and attend incidents of stabbings on the same estates where they are criticised for searching people for knives. Detectives encourage victims of sexual offences to come forward with better care, practices and results. They then have more investigations than they can cope with. Officers volunteer to carry a firearm against a growing firearm threat, and are promptly arrested if they use it, or have their actions judged against the skewed backdrop of North Carolina â€“ which is not a London borough. The new boss will need to tackle the fact that officers spend too much of their time attending incidents better suited to medical personnel, mental health professionals or social workers. These people have not got the help they need due to cuts to key services.   Related: Contenders for the next Met police chief   Ultimately, the commissioner is a political appointment in a police uniform, which is a tough balance to strike. That said, we want a true leader who will berate our shortcomings and celebrate our efforts and successes. We want a boss who will remind people that every officer is also a taxpayer and a member of their community that wants the same things for that community. Every day officers stay on at work for free just to make sure the job gets done. This is never acknowledged or admitted by the upper echelons, as this would be an admission that the cuts that were advertised as not affecting â€œbobbies on the beatâ€ really have. Equally, it would be an admission that the criminal justice system is partly reliant on officersâ€™ goodwill â€“ which might be fragile. Bernard Hogan-Howe made sure to always personally visit officers injured while doing their job. Itâ€™s this kind of personal touch that has made a difference to those officers working for him. Ultimately, what officers want from the new commissioner is what everyone else wants from the police: complete honesty without the political nonsense. Failing that, an individual who is at least two parts bona fide copper to the obligatory one part politician would be nice.",1
"WASHINGTON â€” The courtship of Ryan Zinke began months before the end of the presidential race. A Republican congressman from Montana and a former Navy SEAL commander, Mr. Zinke was approached over the summer by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, about running for the Senate in 2018.To Mr. McConnell, Mr. Zinke (pronounced ZIN-kee) was an ideal candidate to defeat Senator Jon Tester, a two-term Democrat, and bolster the Republicansâ€™ slender majority.Then President-elect Donald J. Trump intervened.Mr. McConnell learned early this week that Mr. Trump had grown interested in Mr. Zinke to be secretary of the interior. Mr. McConnell quickly contacted both Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, in an effort to head off the appointment, according to multiple Republican officials familiar with the calls.Mr. Trump was not moved. He was so taken with Mr. Zinke during their meeting on Monday at Trump Tower that he offered him the position. Mr. Trumpâ€™s son Donald Jr. quashed a competing candidate, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State, because of her support for selling off public land, a senior Republican official said.Mr. Trumpâ€™s defiant selection of Mr. Zinke, 55, dismayed Republicans in the capital and raised suspicions about how reliable an ally he will be for the party. Even as Mr. Trump has installed party stalwarts in a few cabinet departments, he has repeatedly shrugged off the requests of Republicans who have asked for help reinforcing their power in Congress.And having flouted the party establishment throughout the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump now appears determined to go his own way in office, guided by personal chemistry and the opinions of his family members.â€œTrump is following in the footsteps of a lot of presidents who focused on building their administrations first and they werenâ€™t focused on the implications for Congress,â€ said Christopher Ruddy, the founder of the conservative magazine Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump. â€œStrategically, they would not want to hurt the Senate majority right now, but I think theyâ€™re not going to worry about who is going to run or not run, in two or four years, for a Senate seat.â€The Interior Department has not been the only front on which Mr. Trump has appeared indifferent to his partyâ€™s political considerations. The president-elect has also shown limited interest in an effort, spearheaded by Mr. Pence and Mr. Priebus and backed by Mr. McConnell, to install a Democratic senator in his cabinet in the hope of snatching away a newly vacant Senate seat.Mr. Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a close adviser, unsettled Washington Republicans again on Friday when he said at an event in New York that Mr. Trump was closer on some issues to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, than to Mr. McConnell.The choice of Mr. Zinke, however, aggravated the party and vividly illustrated how Mr. Trumpâ€™s improvisational, often impulsive style can collide with the best-laid plans of congressional Republicans.And it underscored the limitations of both traditional political imperatives and Mr. Trumpâ€™s establishment-aligned advisers against the combination of Mr. Trumpâ€™s instincts, the wishes of his family and the preference of Stephen K. Bannon, the senior adviser to the president-elect and an admirer of Mr. Zinke.With just one appointment, Mr. Trump snubbed the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, Ms. McMorris Rodgers, imperiled the partyâ€™s chances in a key Senate race and likely triggered a special election for Mr. Zinkeâ€™s House seat.Fred Davis, a Republican strategist who produced television commercials for Mr. Zinkeâ€™s campaigns, confirmed that national Republicans had been courting the congressman aggressively as an opponent for Mr. Tester.But Mr. Davis, along with a handful of other high-level Republican strategists, said Mr. Zinke had been undecided on entering the race and described the Interior position as a tough job to turn down.â€œHe probably thinks he can do more for Montana and the country in that slot and heâ€™s probably right,â€ Mr. Davis said, adding of the Senate race: â€œIt would have been one of the biggest, toughest battles in the country and now I think Tester probably skates home free.â€Mr. Trump also has not tapped a Democratic senator from a traditionally Republican state for his cabinet, a move that would have helped his party.Party leaders encouraged Mr. Trump early in the transition to recruit two red-state Democratic senators into his administration to make it easier for Republicans to win those Senate seats in 2018, an idea embraced by Mr. Priebus and Mr. Pence.Mr. Trump seemed at first to cooperate, meeting with senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota about potential cabinet appointments.Mr. Trump opted instead for a third candidate: Rick Perry, the former Republican governor of Texas, an enthusiastic surrogate for Mr. Trump during the campaign who had been eyeing positions as secretary of defense or secretary of Homeland Security, only to see them slip away.When Mr. Trump and Mr. Perry met at the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore the previous weekend and discussed the energy position there, Mr. Perry lobbied hard for the job, according to three people familiar with the conversation.Mr. Trump came away impressed and announced him for the appointment a few days later.Mr. Manchin, though, did not seem wounded. His flirtation with a president-elect who won West Virginia by 42 points had won him extensive press coverage at home, photographs in Trump Tower (he declined an invitation from Mr. Trumpâ€™s aides to avoid the press on his way in) and two coveted committee assignments courtesy of Mr. Schumer: Appropriations and Intelligence.â€œWe had a good connection,â€ Mr. Manchin said of his visit, noting that he repeatedly had to cancel on the president-elect and that Mr. Trump still accommodated his schedule. â€œIâ€™ve about spoken to him more in the weeks since heâ€™s been elected than Iâ€™ve spoken to President Obama in eight years.â€Ms. Heitkamp has not withdrawn her name from consideration yet, despite not being picked for either of the two posts she had been seeking, Energy or Interior. Some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers are still optimistic that she can be convinced to become secretary of agriculture, one of the few cabinet positions yet to be filled.But Byron Dorgan, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota, among others, indicated she will not join.And there is growing concern in Mr. Trumpâ€™s orbit that Ms. Heitkamp, much like Mr. Manchin, is enjoying the political benefit of being courted by a president-elect popular in her home state, but that she has no intention of joining the cabinet. Mr. Trump has started assessing other candidates for Agriculture, including Gov. C.L. (Butch) Otter of Idaho.Yet most troubling to congressional Republicans is the Montana seat, which they lost in 2012 in part because a Libertarian on the ballot received late support from a liberal group and captured enough of the vote to ensure Mr. Testerâ€™s re-election.House and Senate Republicans had little warning about the decision to select Mr. Zinke and pass over Ms. McMorris Rodgers. Indeed, some House Republican leadership aides believed that Ms. McMorris Rodgers already had the job in hand.Mr. Trumpâ€™s choice of Mr. Zinke, who was not on an initial list of potential Interior candidates, was driven in part by the enthusiasm of Donald Trump Jr., according to several people with direct knowledge of the decision.A hunter with a professed interest in land issues, the younger Mr. Trump is a member of a sportsmenâ€™s group, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, that vigorously criticized Ms. McMorris Rodgers as a candidate for the Interior Department because of her support for selling off public land.The president of that group, Land Tawney, is a supporter of Mr. Tester who ran a â€œsuper PACâ€ supporting the Democratâ€™s last re-election campaign. He denied any ulterior motive in backing Mr. Zinke for the cabinet, calling him an ideal candidate on many of the organizationâ€™s core issues.Mr. Tawney said he had not spoken directly with Donald Trump Jr. about the interior secretary position, but said he assumed Mr. Trump had been aware of the groupâ€™s views on Ms. McMorris Rodgers. He characterized the president-electâ€™s son as a child of privilege who nevertheless enjoys â€œthe challenge, the solitude, the toil, the sweat that is public land hunting.â€â€œItâ€™s a pretty good sign that heâ€™s having influence over his father,â€ Mr. Tawney said. â€œI think heâ€™s having an influence that brings that kind of sportsmanâ€™s conservation ethic forward.â€",1
"New Poll: Almost Everyone Thinks Its Wrong to Jail People for PotScott Morgan Majorities of respondents in the three countries (Britain 56%, Canada 68%, United States 74%) welcome the concept of using alternative penaltiessuch as fines, probation or community servicerather than prison for non-violent offenders.

"Anger and a desire for visceral escapism both seem like legitimate responses to the worldâ€™s worrying direction of political travel in 2016. Slaves â€“ the questionably named Kent two-piece presently punching an unlikely hole in the mainstream with their collision of punk brutalism and post-punk acerbic humour â€“ canâ€™t seem to decide if they want to be a conductor for youthful disaffection, or simply an indignant distraction from the state of things. Lights bathe the stage a suitably bloody shade of red as heavily tattooed guitarist and bassist Laurie Vincent and stand-up drummer and singer Isaac Holman melt the mosh pit into a blur of flailing limbs and tumbling bodies with speed-riffing opener Hey. Stripped to the waist after five songs â€“ justifiably, considering the sweaty exertion with which he punishes his rudimentary kit â€“ Holman dedicates Rich Man to â€œtax avoiding, pig-fucking politiciansâ€ and it doesnâ€™t take much imagination to know whom heâ€™s referring to. He earns a cheer from the young audience.     Furious fun â€¦ bassist and guitarist Laurie Vincent. Photograph: RMV/Rex/Shutterstock   But put that statement in context with other songs tonight about girl fights, sasquatch paranoia in the woods around Royal Tunbridge Wells, and one Queens of the Stone Age heavy number called Same Again, during which an inflatable manta ray crowd surfs across the front rows, and itâ€™s apparent that Slavesâ€™ commitment to furious political commentary doesnâ€™t outstrip their commitment to knowingly dumb post-ironic fun.   Related: Slaves: Take Control review â€“ Tunbridge Wells' ironic punks lose their appeal   They barrel through about 25 songs in 75 minutes. Even with only the most basic of rock band instrumentation at their disposal, Slaves never feel repetitive, nor less than electrifying to watch. Impressively, their second album â€“ the title of which, Take Control, bears unfulfilled promise of a sardonic riposte to the Brexit soundbite â€“ is produced by Michael â€œMike Dâ€ Diamond, whom Holman references with wideboy hubris during the queasily lolloping People That You Meet in the line, â€œHe used to be a Beastie Boy but now he works for me!â€  The record was made in Malibu, but Vincent and Holman clearly havenâ€™t forgotten the home counties crucible in which their bond was first forged. Fuck the Hi-Hat is a 45-second hardcore punk flick of the Vs to the pub audiences back in the bandâ€™s early days who used to heckle Holman for his unconventional drum setup.  Scything at his cymbals, sometimes with both feet off the ground, Holman can feel vindicated in being probably the only stand-up drummer-singer ever to have inked a major label record deal and sold out the Barrowlands. But Slavesâ€™ sizeable potential remains to be fulfilled. Sneering at the metropolitan rat race and lamenting young lives lost to the nine-to-five grind respectively, Cheer Up London and Spit It Out are splintered, snotty standouts of the showâ€™s final phase that each test the limits of the venueâ€™s sprung dancefloor.  Yet both feel thematically uninspired coming from a twosome with the apparent wit and gall to say something meaningful and energising to their dedicated crowd. A crowd that, if Slaves were to try them, could prove just as prepared to soak themselves in punk musicâ€™s possibilities as a vehicle for protest as they seem prepared to soak themselves in mosh pit sweat.  â€¢ At O2 Academy, Bristol, 21 November.

"Capping a week of scrutiny for Bank of America, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo took another swing on Wednesday at uncovering which of the bank's executives knew about large losses and bonus payouts at Merrill Lynch just before the two banks merged last year. In an unusual move that could herald closer examination of corporate boards, Cuomo issued subpoenas to five current and former directors of the bank as part of his ongoing inquiry into its hastily arranged takeover of Merrill, a person briefed on the investigation said. A second person briefed on the inquiry said the directors who had received subpoenas included members of the firm's audit committee, which was responsible for reviewing significant legal matters, including the takeover of Merrill. Both the individuals who had been briefed on the inquiry asked not to be identified because they had signed confidentiality agreements involving the matter. The subpoenaed board members include William Barnet III, a real estate executive and the mayor of Spartanburg, S.C.; John T. Collins, a venture capital investor based in Boston; Tommy R. Franks, the retired four-star Army general; Walter E. Massey, the former president of Morehouse College in Atlanta; and Thomas J. May, head of the Boston utility company NSTAR, this person said. Cuomo's office wants to know whether Bank of America's board knew of additional losses discovered at Merrill after the merger was signed, as well as billions of dollars in bonus payments made to Merrill executives before the deal closed. Based on earlier interviews with the bank's executives, investigators believe the bank's audit committee and other directors might have known about losses and bonus payments before shareholders voted to approve the deal in early December, this person said. It is rare for prosecutors to subpoena members of a company's board in a criminal case. Cuomo's action is an indication that board members may not be immune to charges in cases where executives they oversee are prosecuted, said Cornelius Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law. 'I would be very concerned if I was a director of Bank of America,' Hurley said. ",1
"BREAKING: Ivanka Trump Berated By Furious Liberal On Plane, Immediately Gets Hit With Devastating Justice Ivanka Trump got quite a scare this week when she was attacked by a liberal lawyer onboard a JetBlue flight to Palm Beach, Florida. Daily Mail reported that the 35-year-old had just boarded the flight with her children when she was attacked by a man with a child in his arms. Your father is ruining the country, Dan Goldstein, a lawyer from Brooklyn, told reporters. Why is she on our flight? She should be flying private. Ivanka kept her cool and swiftly ignored the man, distracting her children with crayons and trying to diffuse the situation. The crew stepped in to escort Goldstein from the plane. His husband, Matthew Lasner, later to took to Twitter to criticize JetBlue officials for acting unfairly. My husband expressed his displeasure in a calm tone, JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane, Lasner wrote. Hours before, however, he posted: Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil. Lasner also snapped a photo of Ivanka. He then quickly deleted all of the tweets. JetBlue defended their actions by releasing the following statement: ",0
"More than 100,000 people have been evacuated from the path of Typhoon Ketsana as it bears down on central Vietnam, an official said Tuesday. As a weaker tropical storm, Ketsana battered the Philippines at the weekend, killing at least 240 people and rendering nearly 400,000 homeless. Ketsana has since intensified in strength as it crosses the Pacific and, according to Vietnamese government forecasters, is likely to slam into the coast of central Vietnam later Tuesday. The Hong Kong Observatory said that as of 0200 GMT, Typhoon Ketsana was centred about 130 kilometres (80 miles) east-southeast of Danang and was moving west towards central Vietnam at about 12 kilometres per hour. Authorities have mobilised several thousand military personnel and police to help residents out of the typhoon path, according to Nguyen The Hung of the national flood and storm control committee. 'Most fishing vessels have returned to port,' he said. Vietnam Airlines on Monday said it was suspending flights to the central tourism hubs of Danang and Hue. Hung said 'serious flooding' was feared and that residents who have not evacuated should stay indoors and avoid all non-essential travel. Tropical storm weather in the past week has already killed 18 people in central Vietnam, including from drowning, electrocution and accidents, the official said. ",1

"Having a job (or three) is far from enough After getting laid off early this year, David Fagerstrom Sr. managed to find not one, but three, jobs. Yet he still has a big problem: The combined pay of the part-time positions is less than a third of his old salary at Kronos Inc. in Chelmsford. As a result, Fagerstrom, who worked nearly a decade as a business operations analyst at the software maker, has cut spending everywhere he can, including restaurant meals, vacations, and nights out with friends. He's falling behind on car and mortgage payments, and foreclosure no longer seems unthinkable. 'It's really forcing us to live life on the edge,' said Fagerstrom, 63, of Salem, N.H. 'There just ain't enough coming in.' Fagerstrom's predicament helps explain why the economy has been so slow to rebound from the recent recession, and why many economists expect a long, difficult recovery ahead. As fast as jobs have disappeared over the past year, wage and salary income has fallen even faster, as many workers have had their pay cut, hours reduced, or like Fagerstrom, had to take part-time or low-paying jobs because they can't find other work. Wage and salary income drives consumer spending, which in turn drives the US economy, according to analysts. And with credit tight and many consumers unable to borrow against rising home values, many people have little extra money to spend. Wages and salaries are expected to play an even bigger role in supporting economic activity in coming years. Nationally, the number of people working part time because they can't find full-time work has doubled since the recession began at the end of 2007, to about 9.2 million, according to the US Labor Department. In Massachusetts, the number has nearly tripled, to about 175,000, according to Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies. 'A lot of people are underemployed, and that magnifies the impact of the recession,' said Northeastern economics professor Alan Clayton-Matthews. 'They work less, they have less money, and they spend less. That's the vicious cycle of recessions.' While wage and salary income has ticked up a bit recently, it is coming off a devastating slide over the past year. Wages and salaries paid by private employers nationally have fallen from the previous year for four consecutive quarters, the most prolonged decline in 60 years, according to the US Commerce Department. In Massachusetts, which entered the recession later than the nation, wage and salary income has fallen for three consecutive quarters, according to estimates by Clayton-Matthews. In the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, wages and salaries paid by Massachusetts employers plunged 5 percent from a year earlier, compared with an employment decline of about 3 percent. Meanwhile, spending fell about 8 percent during the same period. As the income decline shows, the official unemployment rate, as high as it is, fails to capture completely the weakness of the economy. Fagerstrom, for example, is counted as employed by the US Labor Department because he teaches an economics class at Northern Essex Community College in Haverhill, another economics class at Southern New Hampshire University in Salem, N.H., and does occasional contract work for a Maryland firm. Together, the three jobs pay him about $30,000 a year. But it still feels like unemployment to Fagerstrom. 'Financially, it's really touch and go,' he said. 'I would still like to believe I have the talents to earn the same salary I earned at Kronos,' where he earned about $100,000 a year. More than 24 million, or 16 percent, of US workers, including more than 400,000, or 13 percent, in Massachusetts, are counted as unemployed or working part time because they can't find full-time employment. The official unemployment rate is 10 percent nationally, 8.8 percent in Massachusetts. The large number of people competing for jobs means that people's earnings are likely to increase only slowly, analysts said. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, said the national jobless rate would have to slip below 9 percent before workers begin to see modest gains in their paychecks, although it wouldn't be enough to keep up with inflation. The unemployment rate is not expected to fall below 9 percent until the second half of 2011, according to Moody's Economy.com's forecast. The unemployment rate would have to fall to about 6 percent - which most economists say is several years away - before workers experience real, inflation-adjusted gains, Zandi said. 'That doesn't mean the economy can't come back. It just can't come roaring back,' Zandi said. 'Wages and salaries are the fuel that powers consumer spending, which is the key to economic recovery. If they're falling, consumers don't have the fuel or fire power to spend.' With so many workers looking for jobs, it's a buyer's market for employers. Cindy-jo Gross was a vice president for a senior health care management firm when she was laid off more than a year ago. She decided to leave the executive suite to work closer to patient care, expecting to take a pay cut to change her career focus - but not as big a cut as some companies wanted. Some offered salaries that were just over half of what she had earned before, saying that they could find people who would work for a lot less. 'The competition was up, and the demand was down,' said Gross, 46, who recently started a job managing a primary care practice in Foxborough for Partners HealthCare System Inc., at about 25 percent less than her old salary. Evens Auguste, 50, of Brockton, is earning less than half of his old salary. After getting laid off from an information technology job, he spent more than a year looking for a similar position. In January, he took a job driving a Cambridge cab. Married, with a grown daughter, Auguste said there's just enough money to pay the bills. 'Going out for dinner is out of the question,' he said. He still hopes to find a new technology job. He's studying computer security to add another certification to his two associate's degrees. In the meantime, he's driving 12-hour shifts, six days a week, typically earning $50 to $80 a day, although he has made as much as $150 in a shift. 'Sometimes,' he said, 'you have a good day. But it doesn't happen that much.' Robert Gavin can be reached at rgavin@globe.com. ",1
"Now that commercial drones have navigated Washington, they should be headed for a town â€” or work site â€” near you.What then?As Cecilia Kang writes, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued rules for how companies can use unmanned aircraft. There is nothing too surprising in the long-awaited rules â€” you have to be over 16, pass a written test and canâ€™t fly too high or near an airport â€” but just having them means companies can start making small and cheap vehicles a part of ordinary working life.Expectations are for uses like aerial photography or the inspection of building sites and pipelines, but technology frequently has a way of trumping expectations. Maybe drones will fly over parking lots and map the heat of parked cars, to tell how long people are shopping. Maybe some kind of quadcopter crop or animal management is in the offing.If a lot of uses arise, without too many problems, itâ€™s likely the government will allow for additional drone uses, like package delivery or emergency rescue with larger vehicles. Laws and regulations, after all, tend to reflect changing social expectations.The drone business certainly acts like there is more to come. There are start-ups in Silicon Valley offering operating systems as well as vehicle makers that encourage people to experiment with their aircraft. In effect, they are software companies that hope the hacker ethos of computing (try lots of stuff, make unexpected innovations at a furious clip) can take to the skies.In rural states there are other business ideas, which will have their own boost from the F.A.A. decision to approve commercial drones. North Dakota, which already has perhaps the worldâ€™s leading pilot school, is training drone pilots and fostering start-ups aimed at the agriculture world.Upstate New York has companies working on remote sensing systems. One probable outcome is that drones will, once weâ€™re habituated to them, fly great distances with no human keeping an eye on them.Of course, companies like Amazon are interested in the possibility of drone delivery of consumer goods. Google seems to view drones for that, but also as supreme data collectors that could help turn Google Maps into a three-dimensional monitor of the world, in real time.The question now is when, not if. The F.A.A. by nature works more with companies than with the general public, so it would take a lot of citizen discontent to stop the drones. The bigger challenge will come from local communities, which are more responsive to individual complaints.Even so, thatâ€™s unlikely to stop this industry.",1

"NIH: We May Have to Vaccinate Whole Countries to Stop Ebola OutbreakMelissa Melton Two days ago, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Canadian Press that its quite conceivable, if not likely that fast-tracked Ebola vaccines may have to given to entire countries to get the viral outbreak under control (via Modern Healthcare): The article did not specify which country in particular Dr. Fauci whose institute just so happens to be currently working on an experimental Ebola vaccine (the first to begin human clinical trials) with Big Pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline was referring to. Was he talking specifically about Sierra Leone? Liberia? Guinea? Any place where Ebola has taken hold? The entire continent of Africa? Other countries, should it break out there including Spain or America? The prospects of countrywide vaccination for Ebola with a rushed-to-market vaccination are absolutely horrifying. Recall that some 800 children in Europe are now suffering narcolepsy thanks to the rushed swine flu vaccine. Daisy Luther of The Organic Prepper wrote: Thats not to mention a4,250% increase in fetal deaths linked to the shot when given to pregnant women as well, amounting to thousands of miscarriages among a lovely menagerie of other awful adverse events. And for what? What was revealed later to be a global hoax tied to grand financial motives, as Aaron Dykes reported back in 2010: Rest assured that whatever Ebola vaccine they come up with now will be even that much more rushed than the N1H1 vax. Why rushed? As Truthstream Media reported, check out what Dr. Ben Neuman told Bloombergthis past summer in an interview on why no vaccine for Ebola currently exists: Well there is definitely enough panic now, wouldnt you say? Dave Hodges, over at The Common Sense Show, has already penned an article demonstrating how the CDC has positioned themselves to profit financially should Ebola spread throughout the U.S.: That might explain why the CDC is so against banning air travel from West Africa and even continues to change its basic stance on how the virus is even spread. The World Health Organizations latest figures on the current outbreak show that over 8,000 people have been diagnosed with Ebola as of October 5th, and nearly 4,000 people have now died. Either way, I think I can speak safely for the staff here at The Daily Sheeple (as well as selfnews Post Ed.): we will not be rolling up our sleeves for any nationwide Ebola vaccination program any time not just soon, but ever.

"Alongside regular collaborator Dev Hynes and the likes of Kelani and How To Dress Well, Solange Knowles has carved out an interesting position for herself on the periphery of the pop/R&B mainstream. Sheâ€™s a brilliant, constantly evolving pop star who you sense could dash out a hit at the drop of a hat, but thereâ€™s an artful, keening single-mindedness at the core of what she does that means she rarely appears to be chasing chart success.  The densely layered, 21-track A Seat at the Table â€“ her first full album since 2008 â€“ doesnâ€™t really change that. Even Losing You, the crowning glory of 2012â€™s Hynes co-produced True EP, has a sonic restlessness to it that makes it hard to pin down, while that sound â€“ a sort of amalgam of late-80s pop and low-slung R&B â€“ has since cropped up on albums by the likes of Carly Rae Jepsen. As Bustle pointed out, though Solange didnâ€™t appear on sister BeyoncÃ©â€™s Lemonade album, her influence is everywhere.   Related: Solange Knowles: Dev Hynes's wizard beats suit my stubbornness but I'm no hipster   With only one song released since True â€“ 2013â€™s knowingly titled Cash In, the last track from the Saint Heron compilation album she curated to â€œhighlight and align a new movement of contemporary, genre-defying R&B visionariesâ€ â€“ Knowles is also not an artist to be rushed. A Seat at the Table is only her third album since her debut Solo Star (2003), but itâ€™s an album that showcases a very different, much more socially aware and outward-looking artist. From her recent essay detailing the alleged racially-motivated abuse she and her family received at a Kraftwerk concert, to her support of the Black Lives Matter movement, A Seat at the Table â€“ the title itself a nod to giving voice to the voiceless and creating a level platform for change â€“ is imbued with a sense of trying to make sense of the world. Or, as she says in the press release, itâ€™s â€œa project on identity, empowerment, independence, grief and healingâ€. After the delicate, 90-second opener Rise, the first words uttered on the album are telling. â€œIâ€™m weary of the ways of the world,â€ opens Weary, an organ-drenched shuffle that recalls the Dirty Projectors (who sheâ€™s previously worked with) and features lashings of gorgeous harmonies. Later, on the Q-Tip-assisted Borderline (An Ode to Self Care) she sighs: â€œIâ€™m tired.â€ So, while thereâ€™s anger and frustration throughout A Seat at the Table, itâ€™s often presented calmly, almost matter-of-factly. Knowlesâ€™ honeyed voice, like her sisterâ€™s, rarely switches in tone, with the stately, vintage soul of Lil Wayne collaboration Mad delivering the line, â€œI ran into this girl, I said Iâ€™m tired of explaining, man this shit is draining but Iâ€™m not really allowed to be madâ€ with the despondency of someone whoâ€™s had to say it too often.  Thereâ€™s a great bit where, in one of the albumâ€™s many interludes, Knowlesâ€™ mum Tina delivers a brilliant, clear-headed speech on how celebrating blackness isnâ€™t anti-white that segues straight into Donâ€™t Touch My Hair (â€œ... when itâ€™s the feelings I wearâ€), a Sampha-assisted soft electro-funk throb that nails the reclamation of black identity.    Gorgeous harmonies â€¦ Solange   The albumâ€™s most overt statement, however, is the brilliant FUBU (â€œfor us by usâ€), a horn-laced, low-slung anthem that takes in New Orleans jazz and delicate electronics. Revolving around the line, â€œThis shit is for usâ€, Solange places herself directly in the songâ€™s celebration of blackness when she sings: â€œI hope my son will bang this song so loud, that he almost makes his walls fall down, cos his momma wants to make him proud, oh to be us.â€ Itâ€™s a joyous moment.  Similarly joyous is the synthetic funk of Junie, a song dedicated to Ohio Players legend Junie Morrison, while the zigzagging electronic pulse and cascading vocals of Donâ€™t You Wait recall the softer moments on True. The airy Cranes in the Sky, meanwhile, must be the prettiest song ever about trying to alleviate the thick fog of sadness (â€œI tried to dance it awayâ€). Once again, her voice â€“ assisted by forgotten R&B singer Tweet â€“ is almost unspeakably lovely. Anyone hoping for another Losing You, or Sandcastle Disco from her undervalued Sol-Angel and the Hadley St Dreams album, is likely to be initially disappointed by A Seat at the Table. Clearly crafted to be listened to as a full album, songs segue into each other with the interludes helping to govern tone and move the album through its various moods. Like Blood Orangeâ€™s equally sprawling Freetown Sound, itâ€™s an album that unfurls at its own pace, each song packed with as many melodic flourishes as youâ€™d get across whole albums by many artists. Its delicate anger and the measured way it unpacks a host of issues means you want to give it the time it deserves rather than demanding it reveal itself immediately. Thereâ€™s a unique brilliance to that.",1
"The 2016 US Presidential Election What is Really at StakeOp-Ed by Janet Phelan While passions are running high, a bit of temperate objectivity might put some things in perspective. The fact is that we have a psychopathic liar running against a narcissistic moron. Does that clarify things at all? The questions we should be asking this election cycle are not, Who you voting for? but rather, How did things get to this point? A country of 300 plus million, which boasts that Anyone can be President! might have produced a viable candidate for the top office. Instead, we are faced with a choice between an unrepentant liar and someone whose policies are uninformed at the very best and dangerous at the worst. The choice is between a political insider who has broken innumerable laws and in so doing placed the security of the nation at risk and yet continues to lie about her actions on the one hand and on the other, a racist and misogynist whose overblown sense of his own abilities might qualify him for time-out in a rubber room. On a deeper level, the passions running on both sides of the political fence indicate an undercurrent of profound anxiety which is altogether appropriate, given the stakes in this election. The 2016 Presidential election is not taking place during a time of peace and prosperity. The aggressions unleashed after the events of September 11 have brought us a state of global and continual war. Depending on your definition of war, writes Tim McGrath in a 2014 article in The Mint Press, one might conclude that the US was currently involved in 134 wars. Due to the inadequacy of counting protocols, it is difficult to determine the death toll due to these wars. In April of 2015, Physicians for Social Responsibility issued a report stating a death count of somewhere between 1.3 million and two million victims in the first ten years of the war on terror. Democracy has also been a victim of the war on terror. As a result of the manipulation of the perception of terrorist threat, the US has virtually abandoned any pretense of having a viable democracy. Gone are the rights which protected us from overreach on the part of our government and gone are the rights to petition for redress in the event of such trespass. Yet another casualty in the war on terror, as its plays out domestically, is the knowledge that law enforcement officers will protect us and not attack us. If a Pandoras Box were opened on the morning of September 11, surely what was set loose is war and rampant insecurity. The economic fragility that has ensued can be seen by anyone walking through downtown Main Street. Homeless line the curbs, banks continue to foreclose on homes, businesses have closed and the only ones being offered safe harbor are the banks which enabled this blight. In a recent article in New Eastern Outlook, correspondent Phil Butler announced that this election May be the beginning of the end. I should like to propose that the end is already well at play, and, as T.S. Eliot once wrote, Not with a bang but with a whimper. While we may not consciously know how close we are to the brink, our innate sense of things is screaming at us to pay attention. So when violence breaks out at Trump or Clinton events, it is being spurred by the perception that we are at the tipping point. And as we are given only two choices (sorry, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, but you really are sidelined at this event) and as the unavoidable underlying perception is that this election is taking place at the brink of the abyss, it is hardly surprising that physical conflicts result. The passions on the right or left may be motivated by the same core perception but are evidencing themselves in strong displays of partisanship. Objectively speaking, both candidates are utterly trashy. So rather than pick apart the refuse of the American dream, lets take a good hard look at what we intuitively already know. America is being destroyed, and destroyed from within. As the quote unquote leader of the free world, America would be at the top of the list for destruction for anyone seeking total world control. The strongest and most vibrant democracies would have to be taken down in order to clamp the vise tight on the globe. And as America savages its constitutional protections, one cant help but noting that the other quote unquote Western democracies are following suit. It is no secret that the passage into law of the USA PATRIOT Act, following the attacks of 911, shredded the US bill of rights. Similar laws were subsequently passed in other quote unquote vibrant Western democracies, including Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany, to name some of the major contenders. If we didnt quite get it before, Ed Snowdens revelations should have gotten us up to speed. The global surveillance state is now up and running. The initiation of a surveillance state is only preparatory to the next step, which would involve the elimination of unsavory elements. Given the fundamental history of this sort of thing manifesting in the quote unquote Western democracies, one could foresee that this might involve the elimination of undesirable racial groups as well as of political enemies. And for those who find this bald statement to be over the top, it doesnt take too much research to see that This Is Already Happening. This recent article in the venerable Time Magazine only reveals the tip of a relentless and morally unacceptable impetus. Neither a Trump nor a Clinton presidency presents an alternative to this dystopian scenario. Whether Mr. Trump has been read-in to the plans or not is almost irrelevant. His inherent racist beliefs as well as his on-the-record statements about suppressing political dissent make him a ripe candidate for presiding over the endgame. And as the obvious favorite of the powers-that-be, Hillary Clinton would be unlikely to deviate from the plan. So while you are bashing away at your neighbors or your online contacts about their positions on this upcoming election, consider this. What is at stake is not four red or blue years. What is at stake now is whether or not there will be a future worth inhabiting. And that is not going to be decided at the ballot box.

Good article but pearls before swine Im afraid. Thought provoking but damn! Stop with the quote unquote already. America is at stake! How dumb can we get? Every four years we keep making the same mistake, only the names change. Another election, another opportunity to figure out that we have been had and that by our own making. If this election doesnt wake you up to this fact, count yourself among the walking dead. Hillary and Donald: the inevitable consequence of the constitutional framers banning Christian tests in Article 6, thereby eliminating mandatory biblical qualifications for civil leaders. America has been doomed to nothing but nincompoops, scoundrels, and outright criminals ever since. Sound familiar? The 18th-century founders usurped Yahwehs exclusive election authority (Deuteronomy 17:15), thereby turning it over to We the People, the majority of whom, according to Matthew 7:13-14, are in the broad way leading to destruction. Talk about a D U M B idea! Just where do you suppose thats going to get us? Perhaps the precipice of moral depravity and destruction!?! No wonder following every election, America only becomes more ungodly, less Christian, and further enslaved regardless whether a donkey or an elephant is elected.

"Reality is a psyopJon Rappoport We met in 1987. We became friends and colleagues. Over the course of several years, I interviewed him many times. Jack eventually gave up on straight hypnosis-and-suggestion as a way to do therapy. He said, Im finding that people who come to my office are already in a hypnotic state, so my job is to wake them up. Here is an excerpt from one of our interviews: Q: What does mind control mean to you? A: The total sum of all influences that put people in a reality trance. Q: And whats that? A: A state in which people consider this the only space and the only possible time. Q: And it isnt? A: Reality is a psychological operation. Here we are, this is the only space and time, and were inside it. Whereas, music, for example, invents its own time and even space, and you can see, from peoples reaction to it, how profound other deeper realities can be. If we define ourselves as creatures only capable of living inside one space and time, then we adjust our behavior, our prospects, and we adjust the scope of our desires. So if a person becomes all wound up in this continuumwhich of course he doesthen he loses sight of what? Desire. Because it seems then that reality defines what can be legitimately desired. Everything is backwards. Desire becomes diluted and blunted. And power drains away. Imagine it this way. Theres a machine that keeps manufacturing reality. Space, time, reality. And people, however it happens, hook themselves up to it. Theyre addicts. Q: So who is really carrying out this psychological operation, as you call it? A: The people who run the machine, and the people who, whether they realize it or not, choose to stay attached to what the machine produces. Its a two-way street. But the trump cards are played by the addict. He can either cure himself or remain a slave. Q: When you say there is more than one space and time, do you just mean there are alternative realities or possibilities? A: I mean that, yes, but also more. Space and time are constructs. They can be manipulated. They can be invented by artists. They can be imposed. They can be, at a deep psychological or spiritual level, perceived for what they are: elements that spring out of our state of mind. In one state of mind, youll perceive one corresponding space-time. In another state mind that is quite different, youll perceive another space-time. Q: And knowing that, what can be done? A: Well, with patients, I have them invent different spaces and times. Q: How? A: Several ways. One way is by inventing dreams. Q: Whats the effect of that? A: They begin to receive new feedback. Q: What kind of feedback? A: Every space and every time has different emotions and feelings attached to it. These become chronically experienced feelings. By getting out of a central space and time, the patient feels new things. He is freer. End of interview excerpt Of course, for most people, the idea that we are living in one space and time, or that there is some way to escape it, is preposterous. It doesnt register or make sense. Which is precisely why, to take this discussion down to ground level, the FBI and the media can drive the whole Boston Marathon story like a Cadillac in a parade. They make reality. They are trained to present one version to the public and sell it. Consider a far more mundane example. People walk down the street and look at a large building, and it never occurs to them it was put there. It was conceived, designed, and built. To passersby, its just there. Its a there object in their field of perception. Nothing to think about. Nothing to reflect on. Its a piece of the one and only reality. But a painter, if hes being honest, will tell you that every time he steps up to a blank canvas, hes inventing space and time. Socio-political reality basically means some group has guns and access to fawning media. They can define what exists. They can say, We know exactly what happened in Boston, and here it is. If, magically, overnight, you found yourself in possession of overwhelming force and a direct pipeline to elite media anchors, you could tell your story about what happened in Boston, and you would find millions of people believing you. Your story, presumably, wouldnt mirror what CBS, NBC, and ABC are reporting. But your reality, your space and time, would replace theirs. There is more than one space and time. What would happen if the three major networks, each with considerable power, had come up with three vastly different versions of the Boston massacre? You would see a serious conflict of spaces and times. It would happen before your eyes. It would put people into an existential warp. They wouldnt know what to do. Theyd feel as if their innards were separating, as if they were being drawn and quartered. Consensus reality would begin to disintegrate. A psyop depends on being able to engineer one story line. Take five of the most prestigious medical-research centers in America. Imagine each one came up with, and stuck by, a different explanation for cancer. Genes; environment; mineral deficiency; fungus; oxygen deficit. Imagine that these cancer centers wouldnt budge, no matter what. Youd have five different realities, five different pictures, five different space-times. Youd have decentralization of power at a level no one had ever experienced. A psyop depends on selling one centralized story. Obviously, a very significant proportion of the public wants the centralized story; otherwise, we wouldnt have it. This fact is often covered over by the pretense that were talking about science. For example, the governments version of what happened in New York on 9/11 operates on the basis that the towers fell because two planes crashed into them. And thats science. See, we arent selling anything. Were just reporting how physics worked in the towers. We have no vested interest. Nonsense. Centralized story (psyop) explains how long-standing institutions can continue to thrive. Suppose, for instance, this item hit the network evening news: Today, investigators from a Congressional task force unveiled documents going back more than thirty years in the history of cancer research at the National Cancer Institute [NCI]. These documents reveal widespread collusion, involving more than 400 scientists and bureaucrats, to manufacture a false conclusion about the cause of cancer In any sane society, that would be the end of NCI. But firing 16 scientists, sending one researcher to jail, and sacking the current director would sufficiently placate the public to make them forget the whole thingbecause NCI is centralized reality. To destroy it would be perceived as leaving a hole in space and time. Returning to the Boston massacre, imagine these firmly entrenched conclusions from the three major networks: CBS: FBI and local police killed one terrorist and captured the other in what observers are calling one of the bravest days in the history of law enforcement in America. The victims of the Marathon bombing remain indelibly etched in our hearts and minds as we move forward NBC: After a violent gun battle on the streets of a great American city, during which a suspect in the Boston massacre was killed, an FBI source stunningly revealed they had ended the life of a cooperating informant. He put it this way: The Tsarnaev brothers were recruited by a secret Bureau unit to plant the bombs. The plan was to blame the bombing on so-called patriots, but that fell through, so the Bureau exercised their only option. They put their informants front and center and blamed the whole thing on them ABC: Today, the tragic loss of life and wounding of more than 180 persons at the Boston Marathon were partially redeemed, when Boston police traced three pipe bombs, found at the apartment of one of the Tsarnaev brothers, to a CIA storage locker in Maryland In the midst of an uproar heard and echoed around the world, the networks stand by their contradictory versions of events. No one blinks. No one backs down. A massive blow hits psyop-land. Centralized story? Poleaxed. People dont know what to do. They expect one story line and they get three, from the highest hypnotic and influential media giants. In a literal, though unconscious, sense, familiar time and space begin to fall apart. But actually, its far more surreal for the three major television networks to agree on the substance of every significant event than to come to radically different conclusions. Unfortunately, people dont see it that way. They dont see that three behemoths dispensing the same information are key elements in thought-police fascism. They dont see that the consensus is arranged. They dont see they are being subjected to one space and time. In another interview, Jack True proposed the following: Here is a loopy scenario. A wild one. We have a young boy living in a tiny cottage with his parents at the southern tip of South America. One day, he writes, in perfect English, the precise words of a secret CIA memo stashed in a vault in Langley, Virginia. This becomes known and its acknowledged. JACK TRUE, the most creative hypnotherapist on the face of the planet, is featured in THE MATRIX REVEALED. Jacks anti-Matrix understanding of the mind and how to liberate it is unparalleled. His insights are unique, staggering. 43 interviews, 320 pages. That is just a fraction of what THE MATRIX REVEALED has to offer. Now we have a problem that goes a great deal farther than national security. This boys violating the rules of space and time. Hes operating in some other dimension of experience. Two days later, the same thing happens in Mongolia. Another boy, another CIA memo. Then it happens in New Zealand. And Detroit. And Northern Alaska. These boys are penetrating or living in another space-time continuum. Theyre reaching in and pulling out knowledge. It keeps happening. Every week, its a new child. And nobody knows what to do about it. I said, So whats more troubling to the authorities? The exposure of these memos or the fact that the kids can read them from great distances? Obviously, the latter, Jack said. Because if reality is turned on its head, you get tremors. The system is shaken. The powers that be can handle almost any amount of exposure, as long as the system itself stays in place. But when that goes The system IS: one reality, one space and time, one centralized story. I would add to that: one centralized story told by an organization or organizations that are accepted as authoritative. It doesnt matter if CBS tells its story and then a lesser source contradicts it. CBS is sitting in the catbirds seat. You could have a nation, a small nation of 10 million peopleand a few individuals do a fantastic job of exposing the government and a few major corporations, revealing all their crimes, but then what happens? You could get wholesale prosecutions and prison sentences for the criminals who were exposed, but if most of those 10 million people are now looking for a different and better centralized story, it will all go for naught. The basic problem is the addiction to one centralized story, which is always going to be a psyop. To convey the wild and wooly aspect of one space-time versus multiple space-times, fiction is probably a better vehicle. Here are two fragments from a piece I wrote several years ago: HEY! Bargain price! Five-minute money-back guarantee! Well shave down your perceptual field so you can fit in with eight trillion-trillion androids. Youll never miss what you cant see.

"Germany is a goalkeeper country, claimed JÃ¼rgen Klopp, conjuring images of Sepp Maier roaming the Bavarian Alps, Oliver Kahn overseeing heavy industry in the Ruhr Valley and Harald Schumacher lying in wait for Patrick Battiston at the French border. The Liverpool managerâ€™s argument is that a common mentality is responsible for his countryâ€™s rich goalkeeping traditions. His belief, and judgment, is they will be ultimately preserved at Liverpool by Loris Karius.   Related: Georginio Wijnaldum a major doubt for Liverpool versus Manchester United   The 23-year-old will receive a third vote of confidence from Klopp should he start against Manchester United at Anfield on Monday. The first was the managerâ€™s decision to sign the Germany Under-21 international from Kloppâ€™s former club Mainz in May for Â£4.7m. The second was to end Simon Mignoletâ€™s reign as Liverpoolâ€™s firstâ€‘choice goalkeeper once Karius had fully recovered from the broken hand that stalled the succession in pre-season. The third will be to back his young compatriot following an uncertain display last time out at Swansea City with inclusion in the biggest fixture in English club football. Having insisted his goalkeepers are not on trial at Anfield, and the potential ramifications of demoting a young player without good cause, Klopp must be inclined to keep faith as he builds for the present and future. Liverpoolâ€™s manager has no reservations over Kariusâ€™s temperament or pedigree, as evidenced by one of the most important selection calls of his 12-month tenure. â€œHe was a really strong Bundesliga goalkeeper, that means a lot,â€ Klopp has explained. â€œGermany is a goalkeeper country. We have no issue with goalkeepers. The best keeper plays at Bayern Munich and is German. We always had good ones, maybe not always the best in the world but good ones. The mentality is we like this job. The kids like to wear gloves. Itâ€™s good to be in goal for a Bundesliga team.â€   High-profile mistakes against the clubâ€™s fierce rivals are not easily forgotten   Karius was ever-present as Mainz finished an impressive sixth in the Bundesliga last season, his third as the clubâ€™s first-choice goalkeeper. Only the top three â€“ Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen â€“ conceded fewer goals than Mainzâ€™s 42 and, in a poll conducted among his fellow professionals, Liverpoolâ€™s recruit was voted second best in the division behind the formidable Manuel Neuer. Not one of Kariusâ€™s 93 appearances for Mainz, however, carried the same level of scrutiny or global fascination as a fourth competitive outing for Liverpool will do on Monday. Liverpool v United represents a test of nerve as well as ability and, as Jerzy Dudek and David James can testify, high-profile mistakes against the clubâ€™s fierce rivals are not easily forgotten. That said, a goalkeeperâ€™s debut in the fixture is not always an accurate gauge of the career to come. Massimo Taibi was the man of the match on his first appearance for United, a 3-2 win at Anfield in September 1999. However, Karius demonstrated strength of character long before Klopp signed him to exert overdue pressure on, and replace, Mignolet. The former Stuttgart youth-team goalkeeper had to overcome a problematic start at Mainz before establishing himself as the No1 at the age of 20. â€œI saw his way,â€ Klopp said. â€œHe had a bad start at Mainz, when no one wanted him, to become an outstanding goalkeeper.â€ The Biberach-born goalkeeper spent two years at Manchester Cityâ€™s academy â€“ he remains friends with Mario Balotelli from their time together at the Etihad â€“ before choosing to leave in pursuit of first-team football at Kloppâ€™s old club. A single-minded approach to his career was evident again in the summer when he rejected an invitation to represent his country at the Olympics to press his claims at Anfield instead. Innate self-confidence was also on display when he sat down with journalists at Melwood shortly after signing a five-year contract with Liverpool. â€œI wouldnâ€™t come here just to sit on the bench,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not a keeper who hasnâ€™t shown his ability. I know I am a good goalkeeper and Iâ€™ve shown that a lot.â€    Massimo Taibi was man of the match against Liverpool in 1999 but his Manchester United career then petered out. Photograph: Phil Noble/PA Archive/PA Photos   Thanks to Liverpoolâ€™s fine form â€“ and Swanseaâ€™s woeful finishing at the Liberty Stadium a fortnight ago â€“ Karius has had little opportunity to show the credentials that ousted Mignolet from the No1 spot, despite the Belgium internationalâ€™s impressive reaction to the improved competition. There have been no crucial interventions from Karius in appearances against Derby County, Hull City or Swansea; little has been asked of the goalkeeperâ€™s reactions, distribution or communication skills so far. Liverpool will be happy for it to stay that way beyond Monday.   Related: World Cup: 25 stunning moments â€¦ No20: Patrick Battiston loses his teeth   What was notable in the Premier League games, and prompted a few phone-in calls for Mignoletâ€™s reinstatement against United, was Kariusâ€™s reluctance to leave his goalline at set pieces and a hesitancy when dealing with crosses in a congested penalty area. Hull and Swansea scored from corners that Liverpool failed to clear at the first attempt and their susceptibility at set pieces will not be lost on JosÃ© Mourinho in his preparations for Anfield. The flaw was in Liverpoolâ€™s defence before the change of goalkeeper and, as Klopp is fond of saying, it takes a series of lapses for the opposition to have a clear sight of goal rather than one individual error. As with David de Gea and so many goalkeeping imports before him, Karius needs time to adapt to the occasional aerial assault and, more importantly, the physical demands of the Premier League. It can be an arduous, painful process but, as far as Klopp is concerned, his compatriot has had the best grounding.",1
"NYT Editors Ignore GMO Health DangersStephen Lendman It endorses what demands condemnation. It ignores GMO dangers. Doing so betrays its readers. More on that below. GMO foods and ingredients are toxic. Theyre unsafe to eat. They harm human health. Independent scientific research proves it. Coverup and denial suppress whats vital to know. Agribusiness giants want all animal and vegetable life forms patented. They want worldwide food control. They want it genetically engineered. They prioritize profits over human health. GMOs saturate todays foods. The Center for Food Safety (CFS) challeng(es) harmful food production technologies and promot(es) sustainable alternatives. It calls genetically engineered plants and animals one of the greatest and most intractable environmental challenges of the 21 century. In America, up to 85% of corn, 94% of soybeans, 93% of canola, and 88% of cotton are genetically engineered. Over 80% of processed foods contain GMO ingredients. They include dairy and animal products, vegetable oils, soft drinks, ice cream, margarine, peanut butter, tomato sauce, salad dressings, soups, crackers, and much more. Studies prove these foods pose grave human health dangers. They include high toxicity risks, allergenicity, antibiotic resistance, immune-suppression, cancer, and numerous other diseases. They potentially contaminate all non-GMO life forms. Despite risks too great to ignore, Congress and regulatory agencies ignore them. They abdicate their authority doing so. They give agribusiness free reign. They let food giants poison us. Consumers are part of an uncontrolled, unregulated mass human experiment. Doing so risks human health. Once GMO seeds infest an area, nothing known to science can reverse contamination. Reliable scientific evidence is suppressed. People are uninformed in the dark. Rats fed GM potatoes have smaller livers, hearts, testicles and brains. Liver atrophy appears. Their immune systems show damage. Their white blood cells are structurally changed. Theyre more vulnerable to infection and disease. Their thymus and spleens are damaged. Enlarged tissues appear. Their pancreases and intestines show disturbing changes. Potential risk for cancer and other diseases increase. GHW Bushs 1992 Executive Order called GMOs substantially equivalent to ordinary seeds and crops. It said no government regulation is necessary. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an industry front group. Food and drug officials cycle in and out. They notoriously approve unsafe products. They suppress scientific evidence proving it. Doing so harms human health. FDA officials lied. They claim theyre not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way. Safety studies arent needed, they say. Ultimately, it is the food producer that bears responsibility for assuring safety. Jeffrey Smith heads the Institute for Responsible Technology. Hes a leading consumer advocate. He promotes healthy non-GMO foods and ingredients. He does so for good reason. Genetically modified life forms harm human health. FDA approval opened the floodgates. Doing so set the stage for the rapid deployment of the new technology, said Smith. Agribusiness took full advantage. Millions of acres were planted. Hundreds of millions eat toxic foods and ingredients. Consumer objections are ignored. Responsible legislation and regulations are avoided. Agribusiness giants do what they please. Industry studies are substandard. Theyre bad science. Researchers cook the books. They publish false findings. US regulatory agencies dont investigate the impacts of GM food on gut function, liver function, kidney function, the immune system, endocrine system, blood composition, allergic response, effects on the unborn, the potential to cause cancer, or impacts on gut bacteria, says Smith. Independent studies are different. They show GMOs produce disturbing DNA changes. Their natural functioning is impaired. Native genes can be mutated, deleted, permanently turned off or on, says Smith. Inserted genes can become truncated, fragmented, mixed with other genes, inverted or multiplied, and the GM protein it produces may have unintended (harmful) characteristics. When transgenes function in cells, they produce unnatural proteins. Independent scientific testing proves it. GMO corn produces Bt-toxin. Companies claim its safe. Ingesting it risks allergic-type symptoms. Mice showed disturbing immune responses. Abnormal, excessive cell growth appeared. Increasing numbers of human and livestock illnesses are linked to Bt crops. They harm gut bacteria. Intestinal flora become pesticide factories. Independent studies are damning. They show: Farmers report pigs and cows fed GM corn become sterile. Shepherds say one-fourth or more of sheep fed Bt cotton plants died. Other evidence showed similar effects on cows, chickens, water buffaloes, and horses. After GM soy was introduced in Britain, allergies skyrocketed 50%. Earlier in America, a GM food supplement killed dozens. It left thousands of others sick or disabled. Monsantos the worlds largest seed producer. It controls much of the worlds food supply. Its history reflects irresponsible behavior. It includes pressuring and bribing federal officials, highjacking regulatory agencies, suppressing negative product information, threatening scientists and journalists daring to report them, and requiring buyers not to use its seeds for independent research. Other seed producers operate the same way. They do so recklessly and lawlessly. They want total control. They get away with it because no one stops them. Genetic manipulation is fraught with dangers. Its done by inserting a single gene from a species DNA to another unnaturally. According to Smith: A pig can mate with a pig, and a tomato can mate with a tomato. But there is no way that a pig can mate with a tomato and vice versa. Doing so transfers genes across natural barriers. They separated species over millions of evolutionary years. They did so successfully. Agribusiness officials want people to believe they can do nature one better. They claim genetic engineering replicates or involves a superior alternative to natural breeding. Saying so is unproved, indefensible, and irresponsible. Its pseudoscience. Its smokescreen deception. Genetic engineering involves combining genes that never before existed together. Doing so defies natural breeding. It proved safe for millennia. Challenging nature irresponsibly risks enormous human health consequences. Problems like harmful L-Tryptophan occur. Its a natural amino acid. Many companies produce it. Its used to induce sleep. Japans Showa Denko genetically engineered it. It did so in the late 1980s. Many dozens died. Over 1,500 were crippled. Up to 10,000 got Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome (EMS). Its an incurable blood disorder. It causes permanent nerve and muscle tissue scarring, as well as fibrosis, inflammation, and permanent immune system change. Agribusiness officials ignore public safety. They want GMO foods and ingredients unlabeled. They want consumers unaware of what theyre ingesting. They oppose laws regulating or banning GMO products. They call doing so unfair trade practices. Theyve got governments on their side. They let these products be grown internally or imported. World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) patent rules back Agribusiness. What food and seed giants want they get. Profits matter more than human health. Its threatened because federal officials and regulatory agencies do nothing to protect it. New York Times editors are dismissive. On March 14, they headlined Why Label Genetically Engineered Food? Whole Foods Market caused a stir, they said. On March 8, company officials said all GMO products in its North American stores must be labeled. Producers have until 2018 to comply. Why that long wasnt explained. Any private company has the right to require its suppliers to meet labeling standards it chooses to set, and consumers have a right to know whats in the food they are buying. But there is no reliable evidence that genetically modified foods now on the market pose any risk to consumers. The Food and Drug Administration says it has no basis for concluding that foods developed by bioengineering techniques present different or greater safety concerns than foods developed by traditional plant breeding. Independent scientific research proves otherwise. Times editors ignored it. Its standard NYT policy. It marches in lockstep with business. Doing so betrays its readers. It claims no compelling reason to mandate compulsory labeling. It wants consumers unaware of what theyre eating. They can choose organic alternatives if they wish. Saying so ignores common practice. Most people believe food products are safe. They think markets selling them wouldnt do so otherwise. Theyre uninformed and mistaken. Ignorance leaves them vulnerable. It gravely compromises their health and welfare. Dont expect Times editors to explain.

"There Really Were Yellowstone Earthquakes the Weekend of March 30Heather Callaghan This past weekend, on Sunday March 30th, however, three earthquakes broke out and one of then was quite sizable. In fact, it was the largest earthquake to hit in 34 years February 22, 1980. The Weather Channel reports: The quake, the largest since another 4.8 tremor on February 22, 1980, was preceded by two foreshocks measuring 2.8 and 3.0 at 12:23 a.m. and 4:36 a.m. Sunday, respectively. The main shock was then followed by at least four aftershocks ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.3 later Sunday morning. To be sure, this wasnt a stampede of Lion King proportions, but it is curious. Strangely, the buffalo run within the lines in the correct lane on the highway. Some stories along the same lines used planetary and mathematical algorithms to come up with an earthquake/eruption date of March 28th. While planetary alignment predictions fall well outside the realm of this writers sphere, other writers have been cataloging Yellowstone murmurs for awhile, as seismic activity has made headlines for several months. Even though there wasnt a full-blown eruption the weekend of March 28-30th the largest earthquake to occur there since 1980, happening within 24 hours of speculation, is something to ponder. Similar seismic activity occurred before the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Researchers at the Weather Channel, however, dont want to add to panic-stricken posts, and want to assure people that a volcanic eruption is not expected.

"  Related: Can Oregon's tiny houses be part of the solution to homelessness?   As Laura Hubbard-Miles and her husband, Tim Francis, prepared to welcome their third child, their thoughts turned, naturally enough, to their living arrangements. But at a point when most couples start looking for more space, they have instead done the opposite and moved their growing family into a home not much bigger than a garage. The Fruit Store is a 15 sq metre (160 sq ft) stone outhouse that once kept apples fresh but now stores two 34-year-old adults and their children, James, five, Tom, three, and newborn Edith. Even an estate agent would struggle to describe the place as bijou. It is, quite simply, tiny â€“ and thatâ€™s partly why they chose it. While many of us live in poky accommodation owing to a lack of other options, the Laura and Tim have joined a growing number of people purposefully converting to small-scale living â€“ the so-called tiny house movement. Downsizing is hardly a new idea, but its current incarnation is a response to environmental and financial concerns as much as the age-old desire for simplicity and freedom. As house prices continue to rise far beyond the budgets of many families, tiny homes â€“ any residential structure smaller than 46 sq metres â€“ offer a cost-effective and ecologically sound alternative for those prepared to squeeze into them. The movement has slowly been making waves in the UK after gaining popularity in the US, where the architect Sarah Susanka first championed her Not So Big residential philosophy with the publication of The Not So Big House in 1997. This was followed by Shay Solomonâ€™s Little House on a Small Planet, which offered guidelines for effective and thoughtful small-scale living, and Put Your Life on a Diet, by Gregory Johnson, one of the co-founders of the Small House Society, which now has more than 20,000 members.    Tom in the roof space of the familyâ€™s tiny house. Photograph: Sam Frost for the Guardian   Although finding land can be challenging, tiny houses are usually cheap to buy or build. Mark Burton, who runs Tiny House UK, offers custom-built homes from Â£9,995 and kits from Â£6,500. They require little energy to heat and power, so are also affordable to run. Until they made the decision to move to the Fruit Store, the couple lived in a shared-ownership flat in north London, where Tim worked full-time as an architect and Laura as a teacher. â€œThe flat was enormous,â€ Tim says, slightly wistfully, â€œbut there was no outdoor space and just taking the boys to the park was a real expedition. We knew there was no way we could afford anything bigger and after eight years in London we were getting really frustrated.â€   I asked James what he thought about us living here the other day, and he said: â€˜I like it. Weâ€™re like a herdâ€™  Tim Francis    A summer spent in their campervan, volunteering on projects for Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms left the couple wondering how the family could live differently. â€œThe last place we stayed was an eco-village in the Alps where our accommodation was this tiny stone building that just had beds and a wood-burning stove,â€ explains Laura. â€œIt was so cosy and the boys loved it. Weâ€™d got used to travelling in a van and living with very little and we thought, could we do something like this? As we were leaving Switzerland, Tim suggested the Fruit Store.â€ At that stage, the Fruit Store was being used as overflow storage for Timâ€™s parents, Mick and Jude, who live in the former gardenerâ€™s cottage of the Hatherop Estate in rural Gloucestershire. It was cold and dark with no running water or electricity. But it had the enormous benefit of being cost-free and in a desirable part of the country where the family would otherwise have had no chance of owning a home. The lack of overheads would offer an opportunity for Tim to take the plunge into self-employment by setting up his own architectural practice â€“ starting with designing and converting the Fruit Store â€“ and would allow him and Laura to spend more time at home with their children. As for the outdoor space they had all been craving â€“ well, outdoors was pretty much the only space they would have. They called Timâ€™s parents to discuss the idea: â€œThey were unsure at first but quickly became as enthusiastic as we were about giving it a go.â€ A few months later, the couple had sold their London flat and most of their possessions, won change-of-use planning permission and moved in with Mick and Jude to begin work on the Fruit Store.    The family in the Fruit Storeâ€™s main living area. Photograph: Sam Frost for the Guardian   In the past 12 months, they have insulated the walls and installed skylights, flooring, electricity and water. Timâ€™s design packs as much as possible into the limited space. The kitchen consists of a plug-in electric hob unit, a camping fridge and a sink, while the kitchen table unfolds from the wall, with packing crates for chairs. A mezzanine loft doubles as a playroom and bedroom where the two boys sleep on roll-out beds. Built-in benches turn into Laura and Timâ€™s bed, as well as providing storage for the boysâ€™ toys. Each has one box in which to keep their most treasured items â€“ mainly Lego and colouring pencils. Everything else is squeezed into wall-mounted cubby-holes and drawers upstairs. Not only does a tiny home consume less energy than a typical family home, it also enables (or forces) those who live in it to consume less, too: there simply isnâ€™t space to keep unnecessary items. Tim admits he initially struggled with this new, minimalist direction. Their sons adapted far more quickly.   Related: The tiny home movement: a creative response to the US homelessness crisis   â€œOur time in the campervan was a really important middle ground,â€ Laura explains. â€œThe boys got used to just having a rucksack each of toys and there was never a point when we were travelling when they seemed to miss their old toys or were stuck for things to play with.â€ The move has already meant far more intimacy as a family. â€œWe go to sleep hearing each otherâ€™s breathing and we all wake up together,â€ says Tim. â€œI asked James what he thought about us living here the other day, and he said: â€˜I like it. Weâ€™re like a herd,â€™ which I thought was a nice way of looking at it. As an architect you tend to work on the assumption that a family house is X number of bedrooms, arranged in this particular way to a particular set of measurements, but those are quite sloppy assumptions about what a home is or should be. Trying out living on this scale allows us to test what we really need to live.â€ Limited indoor space means more time outside and in the two allotments they have taken on across the road. â€œWeâ€™re far more aware of the seasons than we ever were in London and the fresh air, exercise and intimacy is making Tim and me the most content and fulfilled weâ€™ve been in our adult lives,â€ says Laura. â€œWe donâ€™t need to earn as much as we used to, so we donâ€™t have to spend as much time working as we used to. We have time together as a family.â€ The couple is aware that this initial honeymoon period may not last, especially as the children start school, and that by the time they get closer to their teens such proximity to their parents may be the last thing they want. They are also open to the fact that it may not be something they want to do for ever. They have yet to navigate winter in a tiny house, and the challenges of keeping five people warm and happy when itâ€™s too cold or wet to go outside. â€œWeâ€™ll be glad we chose to do this. Not everyone would want to put up with living in a space this small, but itâ€™s given us time together which we would never have had if weâ€™d continued living in London and working full-time. Itâ€™s definitely an experiment, but weâ€™ll do it for as long as it works.â€ Read more about the Fruit Store project at ruralworkshop.net",1
"Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is normally a mild-mannered man, at least in public, but he unleashed a torrent on Thursday about leaks during the investigation of the Foot Hood shootings and during President Barack Obama's deliberations on sending more American troops to Afghanistan. First, on the president's meetings on Afghanistan: 'I have been appalled by the amount of leaking that has been going on in this process,' Gates told reporters on his plane en route to a Wisconsin factory that is churning out thousands of armored trucks for use by American troops in Afghanistan. He added that he thought 'a lot of different places are leaking' and that he was 'confident that the Department of Defense is one of them.' Then he made a threat: 'And frankly if I found out with high confidence anybody who was leaking in the Department of Defense, who that was, that would probably be a career ender.' The defense secretary moved on to the investigation of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who was charged in the deaths of 13 people on Nov. 5 at Fort Hood, Texas, and what Gates called 'unconscionable' leaks from 'everybody out there with their own little piece of the action.' Then he concluded, 'Everybody ought to just shut up.' Gates was in Wisconsin to visit the Oshkosh Corp., which is making 6,600 trucks to help protect troops from improvised explosive devices, which account for the vast majority of American and NATO casualties in Afghanistan.

"Morgan Stanley Set To Pay $3.2 Billion For 2008 Financial Collapse, Only 2% Of What They BorrowedBy Brianna Acuesta While some may claim that the settlements made with big banks in recent years are better than nothing or are significant amounts, no matter how much that bank borrowed in 2008-2009, to say that these settlements are minuscule at best is an understatement. Last month, Morgan Stanley, one of the largest investment banks in the world and biggest borrowers in the 2008 financial crisis, agreed to pay $3.2 billion in a settlement with federal authorities. Although $3.2 billion may seem like a lot of money, and it absolutely is for people not in the investment banking business, lets compare this settlement to other settlements reached in relation to the crisis. JPMorgan reached a $13 billion settlement, Citigroup reached a $7 billion agreement, and Bank of America agreed to a historic settlement of $16.6 billion. Compared to these hefty settlements, $3.2 billion really doesnt seem like much, especially considering Morgan Stanley borrowed more than almost any other bank during the crisis. What role did the banks play in the collapse of the housing market and the financial crisis that ensued? They lied and were extremely irresponsible with the mortgage packages they were selling. They would give the loan a high rating of security when it actually had risky factors inside of it and handed them out like candy to people that werent likely to be able to pay them back. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the illegal and irresponsible practices Morgan Stanley was involved in, among many other banks, but these practices essentially caused the biggest financial crisis in America since the Great Depression. Why did the banks allow this to happen? Oscar-winning film The Big Short, which details the discovery of the impending economic collapse, suggests that the big banks knew that the government would have to bail them out to protect the country from an even bigger collapse. And bail them out, they did. In 2008, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was founded as a group that would allocate funds to bail out the banks that were failing and essential to the economy. Rather than nationalize the banks in an effort to protect taxpayers, whose money was essentially buying out the banks, the corrupt Federal Reserve gave money to the banks so they could stay afloat and remain independent. The banks wound up receiving about $700 billion as reported by TARP, but this was only a fraction of how much the Federal Reserve spent, lent, or guaranteed, which was estimated to be $7.7 trillion. How big does the $3.2 settlement look now? Morgan Stanley was reportedly given $107 billion in the bailout, more than most banks received. This means that the $3.2 billion they settled on is only 2% of what they borrowed from taxpayers during a financial collapse that they caused. The amount is so minuscule that Morgan Stanley had already saved this amount for the settlement, and this is reportedly half of the profits they had just last year. These criminals should be forced to pay back what they borrowed, plus interest. Its the American people that suffered the blows of this financial wrongdoing, with many losing their homes and jobs. To make matters worse, there is a lot of speculation about misallocation of these funds once they were transferred to the banks. Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York and then-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that Citigroup paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to more than 1,038 of its employees after it had received its $45billion TARP funds in late 2008. This corporation and many others have not yet faced charges for their role in the collapse or this gross misuse of taxpayer bailout money. Though $3.2 billion may seem like a significant amount for Morgan Stanley to pay as a settlement for the biggest modern financial collapse in America, it is such a small figure compared to what Morgan Stanley borrowed and what the monetary and person repercussions were for the American people. Yes, its better than nothing, but it certainly shows that the U.S. has not changed much when it comes to catering to these big institutions that hold so much of the country in the palm of their hands.

"Lois Duncan, whose suspenseful young adult novels inspired the slasher movie â€œI Know What You Did Last Summerâ€ and who later wrote about the unsolved murder of her daughter, died on Wednesday at her home in Bradenton, Fla. She was 82.Her husband, Don Arquette, confirmed her death but did not give a cause.Ms. Duncanâ€™s books were practically a rite of passage for many young readers. They featured universal adolescent themes, like alienation and a hunger for acceptance, and thrust protagonists into chilling situations, often with supernatural elements.Her titles included â€œStranger With My Face,â€ â€œDown a Dark Hallâ€ and â€œKilling Mr. Griffin,â€ appearing before young adult fiction became a major genre.â€œI started writing for young adults because I was one,â€ Ms. Duncan told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in 2005.Though her books had their share of violence, Ms. Duncan said she was â€œutterly horrifiedâ€ when she saw the film adaptation of â€œI Know What You Did Last Summer,â€ which was released in 1997 and starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar.The movie turned her novel, about a group of teenagers desperately trying to conceal an accidental killing, into a horror tale in which the same teenagers are systematically dispatched by their hook-wielding victim.â€œThe first time I knew it was a slasher movie was when I bought my popcorn and bought my ticket and excitedly walked into the theater,â€ Ms. Duncan said. â€œThe heads were dropping and the blood was spurting and I was screaming and the audience was screaming.â€Some of her work was decidedly less terrifying. Her novel â€œHotel for Dogsâ€ (1971) became a film starring Lisa Kudrow and Emma Roberts in 2009.In 1989, Ms. Duncanâ€™s youngest daughter, Kaitlyn, died after she was shot while driving in Albuquerque, N.M., in what the authorities called a random attack. Ms. Duncan spent years investigating the crime with the help of reporters, detectives and psychics.Her book about the investigation, â€œWho Killed My Daughter?â€ was published in 1992. It opened with a request for information that might help track down Kaitlynâ€™s killers; Ms. Duncan said she wrote it as a last resort.â€œI was so helpless and I didnâ€™t know what to do next,â€ she said. â€œThe only ammunition I have is the ability to write.â€â€œWho Killed My Daughter?â€ was named the best book for young adults by the American Library Association, even though Ms. Duncan had intended it for an adult audience. The murder remains unsolved.Lois Duncan Steinmetz was born in Philadelphia on April 28, 1934, to Joseph and Lois Steinmetz, both magazine photographers. She grew up in Sarasota and sold her first story to a magazine when she was 13.She attended Duke University in the early 1950s and moved to Albuquerque in 1962. She taught journalism at the University of New Mexico while writing novels and articles for magazines like Redbook and Good Housekeeping.She married Mr. Arquette in the mid-1960s. In addition to her husband, she is survived by three children from an earlier marriage, her daughters Robin Burkin and Kerry Arquette and a son, Brett Arquette; another son, Donald Jr.; a brother, William Steinmetz, and six grandchildren.",1

"Responding to Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson publicly asserting his firm opposition to gay marriage, the reigning MVPs longtime boyfriend Scott Oakes told reporters Tuesday that he can take a hint and now understands that the athlete isnt interested in marrying him. All right, Adrian, I get the message loud and clear, said Oakes, noting that Petersons stated position that gay marriage is not something [he believes] in perfectly explained why his lover had yet to pop the question at any point in their three-year relationship. He cant see himself being with me in the long term? Thats fine, but if thats how he feels, he should have had the guts to tell me directly rather than letting it slip out in some radio interview. Im not with that. Oakes added that, with Peterson now out of the picture, he was considering trying to patch things up with his former flame, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Mike Wallace. ",0
"Three teenagers were in police custody on Monday night after one of them threatened another student with a handgun at a public school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the police said.A staff member at Public School 169 on East 88th Street called 911 shortly before 2 p.m. to report that one student had threatened another with a handgun, the police said.Officers arrived at the school to find three boys, ages 13, 14 and 15, sitting in an administrative office with school staff members.The police said the 13-year-old had pulled out a handgun and menaced another student with it. The weapon was later found in the jacket pocket of the 15-year-old, and a box of ammunition was found in the jacket of the 14-year-old.All three boys were arrested on charges of criminal possession of a weapon on Monday night, the police said, and the 13-year-old will also be charged with menacing in the second degree. They will be treated as juveniles in Family Court, the police said.This is not the first time in recent weeks that the police have responded to reports of a firearm at a New York City school.During the span of one week last month, a 14-year-old boy in Brooklyn and a 15-year-old boy in Queens were arrested after bringing guns to school, the police said, and a 54-year-old man was arrested after his 11-year-old grandson brought his loaded gun to an elementary school in Queens.Officials at the Education Department could not be reached on Monday night.",1

"After art shows in Moscow have been doused in urine, covered in red paint and picketed by conservative activists, one curator has set up a new exhibition in a remote observatory 900 miles from the Russian capital. The show, featuring work from seven Russian and three Austrian artists, is â€œa classic contemporary art experience,â€ explains curator Simon Mraz. So contemporary that a cleaner almost threw away one of the paintings after mistaking it for rubbish.  The 10 artists visited the 1960s observatory in Nizhny Arkhyz, perched in the mountains of the Karachay-Cherkess republic this summer to learn about astronomy.  The observatory founded in 1966 as the space race was hotting up between the Soviet Union and the US and its six-metre diameter telescope was the largest in the world until 1993 when the US built a bigger one in Hawaii.    The star-themed stained glass roof inside the observatory. Photograph: Kevin O'Flynn   As part of the show Irina Korina, a Moscow based-artist, created three installations in the nearby village, whose name translates as â€œScience Villageâ€ to show that for the local residents science is religion.  The rest of the exhibit, which opened last week, is a broad mix of art rarely shown in the remote region. From Eva Engelbertâ€™s space emblems, created in honour of Galina Balashova the only female architect in the Soviet space programme. To a neon installation above the observatory reading â€œthey are brighter than usâ€created by provocative graffiti artist Timofei Radya from Yekaterinburg and only visible to night time visitors.     The offering from provocative artist Radya. Photograph: Timofei Radya   â€œWhen they first proposed [the exhibit] we were wary,â€ said Yury Balega who ran the observatory for more than 20 years, but it turns out â€œartists and astronomers have a lot in commonâ€. But some were left questioning whether the artists truly understood the complicated work of the observatory and what it had managed to achieve. Yevgeny Chentsov, who has worked at the observatory since 1968, described the art as â€œnaive and childlike,â€ which he meant as a compliment adding that astronomers have a similar approach to their work. And it was Austrian artist Michail Michailovâ€™s drawing of dust â€“ which was meant to represent the particles the astronomers look at through the telescope â€“ that was nearly thrown away after being mistaken for dust. An incident brushed off by Mraz as â€œthe risk of contemporary art.â€. Mraz would not say exactly how much it cost to put on the show, but he did say that hosting something similar in Europe would cost around â‚¬100,000. A sizeable sum for an exhibition was only seen by a very small audience, 800 residents of the village and the handful of press that attended the opening, but Mraz believes that it still had an impact. Not only can art help people working in different professions understand each other better, but it can help us â€œunderstand what our country is about.... [especially] in times when politicians are getting crazy,â€ he says.  The curator who has also hosted an art exhibition on an icebreaker in Murmansk , north west Russia, says that in a way remote locations are easier than Moscow: at least â€œnobody was touching it [and] nobody was destroying it.â€",1
"Is Ukraine MP Blaming Putin for the Flu?By Heather Callaghan Coincidentally, reports surfaced of another flu epidemic that spread to civilians in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. It simply isnt clear at this time if the two outbreaks are related, although they both share serious respiratory complications. The U.S. media is still eerily quiet about claims of possible U.S. involvement in a deadly, uncontained outbreak which doesnt respond to modern medicine. Reports of the Ukraine flu, called a Swine flu, continue in the news each day as the death toll climbs and citizens everywhere don white masks. At this point, there are vastly more questions than answers when it comes to either of the viruses circulating in Ukraine. One is being labeled Swine flu and the other California Flu simply because the latter has yet to be identified and allegedly comes from a US laboratory, says geopolitical analyst and writer Brandon Turbeville. The Donetsk Army seems convinced that the two are separate, however, since it has stated clearly that the virus has not been identified. Turbeville also stated, Naturally, if the virus has escaped from a U.S. lab, it presents the possibility for it be used as a propaganda attack on the West, particularly the United States. After all, it has been the United States that created the unrest in Ukraine to begin with. Thats if it came from a U.S. lab. It is quite possible that the virus is a mutation or the product of other factors. If the virus did, in fact, come from the lab in question, then we have a whole new set of questions. We would not be able to assume that the virus escaped from the lab at all. In fact, given the labs general location, it would be a conducive setting for the release of a biological weapon. Its deep inside Ukraine but very close to the Russian border. Not the most ideal in terms of delivery but close enough to have effect. Its important not to lose our heads here though. Every year, fear and panic over viruses and illnesses appear in the mainstream press to disappear just as quickly. Still, its clearly something to keep an eye on. As for Bogomolez statements, allegedly blaming Putin for the flu outbreak, Turbeville said, From everything I can see, Bogomolez is not blaming Putin for the flu. While rhetoric like that tends to come out of the Ukrainian parliament on a regular basis, it seems Bogomolez was simply encouraging the nation by the saying that it would overcome Putin and the flu separately. While the claims of Putins aggression against Ukraine are fanciful, it doesnt appear that she was linking him to the flu.

"The Berlin-based Australian composer and pianist Anthony Pateras doesnâ€™t get a chance to speak to multi-instrumentalist, renowned vocal prodigy and Faith No More frontman Mike Patton very often. Patton admits this makes him feel â€œnervous and scaredâ€, given the pair will be performing together, as duo, tÄ“tÄ“ma, in less than two months time in a one-off show at the Mona Festival of Music and Art (Mona Foma) in Hobart, Australia. When they speak to each other during an interview with Guardian Australia, there is catching up to be done first. They last time they spoke was in June.   Related: Mike Patton side project TÄ“tÄ“ma to perform at Mona Foma festival in world first   â€œWhere the fuck are you, Anthony?â€ Patton asks. â€œYouâ€™re in fucking Sydney? Get the fuck out of here. Iâ€™m surprised. Usually youâ€™re like, in Berlin.â€ Patton explains that between now and their performance together in January, â€œthereâ€™s no way weâ€™re going to be on the same piece of the Earth togetherâ€. Patton is renowned for being a workaholic and taking on multiple projects at once, such as touring with his multitude of bands that include Fantomas and Tomahawk, writing film scores, or collaborating with artists ranging from genre-defying multi-instrumentalist John Zorn to Norwegian singer-songwriter John Kaada. Pateras, too, is constantly on the move, touring with various bands and improvisational groups, writing concert works for orchestras, ensembles and soloists, and running the text and music project, Immediata. â€œMy relationship with Anthony is always very intercontinental, you know?â€ Patton says. â€œBut I love this guy. I love him.â€  Pateras, the more considered of the pair, explains that much of their collaboration as tÄ“tÄ“ma is done over email. In 2014 tÄ“tÄ“ma released their album, Geocidal â€“ an other-worldly mix of exotic percussion, strings, symphonic winds and rock synths, punctuated by Pattonâ€™s vocals â€“ which took about four years to complete.  â€œThat was years of swapping stuff back and forth over email and building on it over an extended period,â€ Pateras says. â€œIt took a long time. The drums were recorded in Paris, clarinets in Santiago, the brass in Berlin. And eventually we met together in San Francisco for three days to do the rest, and we mixed it in Brussels.â€ Pateras needed Patton to do the vocals because â€œthere were not really any other options,â€ he says. Patton, with a vocal range of six octaves, has appeared at the top of lists like worldâ€™s most versatile vocalist and worldâ€™s best vocalist, ahead of Guns Nâ€™ Rosesâ€™ Axl Rose and avant garde soprano Diamanda GalÃ¡s.    tÄ“tÄ“maâ€™s album, Geocidal, took four years to complete, mostly over email.   While Patton laughs dismissively at such descriptors, the fact remains, Pateras says, that â€œin terms of the arrangements and orchestration for tÄ“tÄ“ma, thereâ€™s not many singers qualified to actually handle itâ€. â€œMike has the avant garde sensibility, the orchestral sensibility, the rock sensibility and the electro-acoustic sensibility to deal with this kind of material, and those are all angles and histories I like to address in the music. â€œA key thing which I feel Mike can actually do is have that compositional logic while remaining free and open to the moment. So we work around our respective schedules and make it work because we both love the work so much.â€ Itâ€™s this versatility that has seen Patton croon 1950s and 60s Italian pop under the moniker Mondo Cane, use his voice as both an instrument and a noise machine with experimental rock band Mr Bungle, and beatbox for BjÃ¶rk on her MedÃºlla album. Pateras describes Patton as the rare type of artist who can perform a complex song all the way through in one take.  â€œMusicians today kind of piece things together gradually, and then a take is put together in an edited way,â€ he says. â€œBut Mike is part of a generation of musicians who can do the take all the way through and thereâ€™s a certain feel and discipline to that, which a lot of musicians today are not aware of. That discipline and focus in a take is increasingly rare and is a privilege to witness, and thatâ€™s what I really admire in Mike.â€ Patton responds that while his first takes are â€œusually pretty fucking goodâ€, he is more than happy to take advantage of technology to clean up a messed-up rhythm or redo parts. Despite his vocal prowess, Patton says the idea of performing live with tÄ“tÄ“ma is challenging. The Geocidal album, which explored the concept of â€œthe murder of placeâ€ and which Patton had wrongly assumed would be a piano and vocals record, is full of foreboding landscapes fuelled by an array of erratic instrumentals.  â€œItâ€™s very, very tricky. Itâ€™s the kind of music that makes me go, â€˜Sheesh â€¦ thereâ€™s no easy way of doing this,â€™â€ Patton says. â€œSo you have to figure out a way. You make a record and the record is beautiful but when you want to present it live, itâ€™s a whole other mindset.â€   Related: David Walsh of Mona: on art, sex and why (gallery) size matters   The pair are also producing new material separate to Geocidal to perform for Mona Foma, which will, by necessity, be slightly more contained.  â€œThe notion of a traditional band doesnâ€™t really function for us,â€ Pateras says. â€œSo for Mona we had quite a long conversation about how we could do this live and that took a while to establish â€¦ a year and a half or something. Itâ€™s a little less spiralling outwards.â€  â€¢ tÄ“tÄ“ma is performing on the Mona main stage at Mona Foma on 21 January",1
"Joseph Heller, the author of Catch-22, once gave an interview where he credited his editor with kicking his work into shape. After the interview ran, Heller got an irritated phone call. The caller was his editor, Robert Gottlieb. Gottlieb told Heller to knock it off. â€œI felt then, and still do, that readers shouldnâ€™t be made aware of editorial interventions,â€ Gottlieb writes in his new memoir, Avid Reader: A Life. â€œThey have a right to feel that what theyâ€™re reading comes direct from the author to them.â€ Gottliebâ€™s book is full of stories like that one. He is a very unassuming person, for an alleged legend â€“ a characterization he laughs at to me, saying his daughter pokes fun at him for so often being called it. Yet beginning at Simon & Schuster in the 1950s and 1960s, flourishing at Knopf in the 1970s and 1980s, and with a brief but memorable detour to the New Yorker (as an editor), Gottliebâ€™s editing pen has touched the manuscripts of most of the important American writers of the 20th century â€“ and several of the British ones, too. He did it, though, as much from behind the scenes as he possibly could. â€œIâ€™ve given very few interviews,â€ he told me when I met him at his book-lined townhouse on New Yorkâ€™s East Side. He is only giving this one now, he says, because he needs to help the publisher sell his book.  Avid Reader is, in some way, a book for book nerds. To the average book reader, after all, the world in which Gottlieb has made his career is mostly invisible. Most people do not pay attention to the publisherâ€™s imprint on a given book. Most writers are more egotistical than Heller and do not talk about their editorâ€™s contributions to the finished product in interviews. And most editors share Gottliebâ€™s view that whatâ€™s done in publishing is best kept in publishing. â€œThis is a boring point, but itâ€™s a service job,â€ Gottlieb told me. â€œYouâ€™re there to serve.â€ I point out that one of the purposes Gottlieb has clearly served is the world of letters. Besides Heller, even a short list of people he edited reads like a celebrity roster, if such a thing can be said to exist for the relative unremunerative world of books: Toni Morrison, Mordecai Richler, Edna Oâ€™Brien, Ray Bradbury, Cynthia Ozick, Doris Lessing, John Le CarrÃ©, Michael Crichton, Robert Caro, Katharine Hepburn and Bill Clinton. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, True Grit and of course Catch-22: all of these are classic books that might never have existed in their present form without his work. Over the years that got his name in the papers quite a bit; itâ€™s certainly true that you canâ€™t get very far, looking at 20th-century American writing, without coming across his name. Gottlieb sort of nods at this observation, but continues to insist that for him, celebrating his own achievements was never the point. â€œFor whatever reason, I became a name for a long period of time,â€ he said, waving his hand. â€œI could have been all over the place, I guess, but what a waste of time.â€ In person, itâ€™s easy to see why Gottlieb is an object of devotion for so many of his writers. He is very soft-spoken, but not shy. When he has an opinion, he is clear about it. Talking, for example, about the slow pace of book editing, a process which sometimes takes months, he calls it a â€œtrue crimeâ€ that editors often keep writers waiting. â€œI just find it vile,â€ he said, with real feeling. The essential quality of an editor, he told me, is sympathy. â€œYou donâ€™t take on books with which you do not have a sympathy,â€ he says early in our conversation. â€œOnly trouble can arise if instead of wanting to make a book that you like even better than it is, you want to change it into something that it isnâ€™t.â€ The most disastrous thing that can happen in an editing process is for an editor to insist on making the book their own. â€œFor writers, everything is at stake in this relationship,â€ Gottlieb said. â€œAnd theyâ€™ve very sensitive to whatâ€™s going on even if theyâ€™re not conscious of it.â€ He tells me he knows one of the great gifts of his life was knowing so many interesting people, and is full of gossipy anecdotes about them, the best of which stud this slim book. He writes about meeting Nora Ephron over a silly assignment about publishing lunches that she was given as a small freelance journalist. â€œShe came to the office (for the obligatory sandwich), and within minutes I could tell that she was as embarrassed as I was to be having a discussion about this dopey non-subject,â€ he writes. â€œWithin an hour we both knew that we were going to be friends.â€  Other more formidable acquaintances get no less affectionate treatment. Of his first meeting with Doris Lessing, he writes: â€œShe made no attempt to be charming, and I wouldnâ€™t have been foolish enough to try to charm her,â€ he writes. But the two became fast friends. The big hearts and strong work ethics at the hearts of alleged â€œdivasâ€ is a theme of his, one he returns to again in our interview. â€œAs a worker, she is in no way a diva,â€ he insists of Toni Morrison. â€œI work with many people who are considered extremely difficult and complicated.â€ But he has never had a real problem. That isnâ€™t to say he hasnâ€™t had disagreements. As a young editor, he took on Robert Caroâ€™s The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York. Caroâ€™s storied thoroughness meant that the original manuscript arrived at a length of a million words. (The average non-fiction book is somewhere in the range of 100,000 words.) Gottlieb says it took him a year to cut it down. The long process still resulted in an enormous doorstopper.  Another sort of editor might feel entitled to brag about this achievement. Not Gottlieb. â€œHe feels I am much more important to his work than I feel I am,â€ Gottlieb said of Caro, who he admits he often fights with as they work on a book together. â€œHe doesnâ€™t really need an editor, as much as he likes to think he does, as much as I like to think he does. Because at this point he really knows what heâ€™s doing,â€ he added.",1
"Photos Confirm U.K. Special Forces Protecting Terrorists In SyriaBy Brandon Turbeville The pictures themselves date back to June of this year and appear to have been taken shortly after a battle at al-Tanf between the New Syrian Army and ISIS, both Western-backed terrorist organizations. The British soldiers are photographed allegedly setting up a perimeter in order to guard the NSA base from further incursion by ISIS. As the BBC reports, According to eyewitnesses, they were there in a defensive role. But they are carrying an arsenal of equipment including sniper rifles, heavy machine guns and anti-tank missiles. If IS attacked again they would have been able to put up a considerable fight. A New Syrian Armys spokesman refused to comment on the pictures of the special forces, but acknowledged their help. He said: We are receiving special forces training from our British and American partners. Were also getting weapons and equipment from the Pentagon as well as complete air support. Kareem Shaheen and Ewan McAskill of The Guardian added more detail in their own report published on August 9. They wrote, It is believed to be the first time British forces have been photographed operating inside Syria, where they are engaged in relatively small numbers in wide-ranging roles that include surveillance, advisory and combat. The Thalab (Fox) vehicles are essentially modified, militarised and upgraded Toyota 4x4s used for long distance reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which were developed jointly in the middle of the last decade by a state-backed defence company in Jordan and the UK company Jankel. The vehicle, which has mounted weaponry and is often used for border patrols, has been primarily used by Jordanian special forces. Al-Tanf, where the vehicles were reportedly photographed, is a border crossing between Syria and Iraq that had been under Isis control, and is also not far from the Jordanian border. It is unclear how many Nato countries have deployed the modified trucks, though Belgium ordered a shipment of modified Fox vehicles earlier this year. The images seem to show British forces securing the perimeter of the rebel base following an attack by Isis, according to the BBC. The soldiers can be seen carrying anti-tank missiles, sniper rifles and other heavy artillery. The New Syrian Army is designated as a moderate terrorist organization and fights under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army, another Western-backed moderate operation that has committed innumerable horrific acts of violence and atrocities all throughout the Syrian crisis. It should be noted that the terrorist group that beheaded a young child on camera weeks ago, Nour al-Din al-Zenghi, was also considered a moderate organization and one that had been vetted by the U.S. State Department as worthy of receiving TOW missiles. As Michael Uhler of SouthFront describes the NSA, Unlike the clear knowledge surrounding AmericanYPG relations of involvement, much less is known about US ties to the groups operating in the deserts of southern Syria. Two important groups operating in this area are the Forces of the Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo (Arabic: ) and the New Syrian Army (NSyA) (Arabic: ). Although both of the aforementioned groups receive support from the US, the level of involvement differs. The partnership between America and the NSyA can be regarded as tighter than that of the YPG. Even though the NSyA could arguably be one of the smallest groups comprised under the so-called FSA, the level of training, coordination and equipment surpasses most other groups. Rumors have circulated indicating the possibility of Jordanian special forces within its contingent. (The NSyA has coordinated with the Iraqi government on multiple occasions surrounding the SyrianIraqi border). King Abdullah II of Jordan revealed earlier this year that Jordanian special forces were indeed participating with rebels in this area. The sudden appearance of the NSyA occurred on November 15th, 2015. The NSyA launched its first operation on al-Tanf, which resulted in an attack on ammunition storehouses as well as on a bomb factory. Not much more information other than this video has been released about this raid. Bolstered by Jordan and America, the degree of cooperation can be seen in the groups operational security (OPSEC). Quite different from the groups which fall under the umbrella of the FSA, the NSyA appears to be very professional and keen on keeping any sort of identification to a minimum. It is thus noteworthy that a group working so close with UK Special Forces and, perhaps, Jordanian Special Forces would also be the group that is so keen on keeping the identities of its fighters secret. While this may simply be a result of better training by Western Special Forces (despite relatively poor battlefield performance), many might be caused to wonder whether or not the Special Forces troops themselves make up the ranks of the group, making privacy a necessity not present with other terrorist groups across the country. It is also worth noting that the photographs were taken in June, the same general time frame as when the United States and Russian jets nearly clashed in the skies above al-Tanf. The mid-air confrontation occurred between F/A-18 fighters scrambled by the Pentagon and several SU-34s, Moscows most advanced bombers, Ted Thornhill wrote for the Daily Mail. The Russian jets had struck a 200-strong garrison of Syrian rebels fighting the Islamic State in At-Tanf, near the Jordanian border. The Russian military did not deny the bombing raid but it did deny that it targeted Western-backed terrorists (i.e. terrorists publicly claimed by the United States), making the argument that the United States did not make the positions of its proxy terrorists known to the Russian Air Force. Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov, Spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, claimed the air strike was more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) away from the areas the U.S. had designated as being controlled by legitimate opposition forces. It was not made clear which terrorist organization was being bombed specifically but, given the time frame and location, it is reasonable to wonder whether or not the NSA was the actual target of the Russian bombers and the reason the bombing mission provoked such a strong response from the U.S. Regardless, what is known for certain is that both the United States and the U.K. have egregiously violated Syrian national sovereignty and are working alongside terrorists for the purpose of destroying the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. For this claim, no speculation is necessary.

Those pesky Ruskies. Im not so sure about the Russians any more. Wed have to leave them alone long enough to tell for sure. And we are not likely to do that so long as there are so many conservatives with that neo prefix. Or neo liberals for that matter The difference is that the Russians were invited in by the Syrian government and both the Americans and British staged illegal invasions of a sovereign country. Absolutely true. However, its interesting that last month the Syrian Envoy to the UN requested the UN and its partners oversee the humanitarian corridors within Syria rather than Russia. The UN is a western elite construct by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, the same cabal pulling the strings in the US and UK. The request was reported by some outlets to be a snub to Russia but thats not accurate either. Its about a growing UN dominance in the entire region and beyond. ",0

"The introduction of a winter break in English football appears further away than ever after talks across the game over fixture congestion broke down, leaving the Football League and the Football Association at loggerheads over the issue. The EFL had said at the start of the season it was taking the initiative by proposing a so-called Whole Game Solution that would involve the expansion of the league to take in eight new clubs and a reorganisation into four divisions of 20 teams. It proposed to consult on the plans with clubs, some of which were concerned about potential lost revenue. The plans were designed to provoke a discussion with the Premier League and the FA that could ultimately lead to the introduction of a winter break. But on Wednesday the EFL abruptly abandoned its proposals, saying that the FAâ€™s unwillingness to consider moving FA Cup matches to midweek in rounds four and five to free up more weekends had made the plan unworkable. â€œAs a result of the FAâ€™s decision, the board has been left with no option but to end the Whole Game Solution discussions as, in its current form, it is no longer viable. If the weekend slots are not available, then there is simply no way we can meet the financial conditions [to be no worse off] as outlined at the very outset,â€ the EFL chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said. â€œThe stance the FA has adopted has brought the discussions to a premature end, before fully understanding what the financial outcome from the creation of a new distribution model could be.â€ The FA recently announced a new sixâ€‘year overseas deal for the FA Cup that guarantees Â£800m over that period and which the chief executive, Martin Glenn, said would be â€œtransformativeâ€ to the organisationâ€™s finances. As a condition of the deal it promised to keep FA Cup matches on weekends, but remains open to further negotiation over replays. The FA immediately hit back, saying it was still open to discussions over fixture congestion. Glenn emailed Harvey last week to say that he did not see â€œsufficient advantageâ€ in the EFL plan, highlighting the â€œmassive economic valueâ€ of weekend FA Cup ties. Insiders said it had never indicated that it might be willing to give up weekend FA Cup ties and were surprised by the EFLâ€™s sudden decision to abandon discussions. â€œThe FA remains fully committed to working with the EFL and the Premier League to address the issue of fixture congestion in the professional game,â€ an FA spokesman said. â€œThis is why we are trialling the removal of sixth-round replays in the FA Cup this season and why we supported the EFL in consulting on its innovative ideas for reform. That commitment remains.â€   Related: EFL talks over potential expansion stall due to disagreements with FA   Glenn told the Observer this month that the weekend slots must stay sacrosanct but that he remained â€œoptimisticâ€ a solution could be found that would allow for the introduction of a winter break which could be to the benefit of both England and Premier League clubs in European competition. Any movement on the issue now appears dead in the water, however, with the EFL convinced a winter break would be impossible without the FA giving ground on weekend FA Cup ties. It already faced a struggle to convince its own clubs of the merits of the plan, which would have required a 90% majority at the annual meeting next summer.",1
"Less than 24 hours into their class trip to Washington D.C., ninth-graders from Middleton Junior High School are reporting that three of their female classmates have been fingered. Those students whose fingerings have been confirmed include 14-year-old Lacy DeWitt, 15-year-old Jamie Cavanaugh, and freshman class president Kelly Oswald. Two-thirds of the fingerings occurred before the freshman class reached the National Museum of Natural History. Rumors of a fourth fingering remain unsubstantiated, though students noted that during Friday's showing of Cosmic Collisions at the National Air and Space Museum, Brian Rupp and Laura Burkholder sat in the back of the planetarium far away from chaperones. Burkholder was reportedly wearing a skirt at the time. 'We expect our students to be on their best behavior here in Washington,' said vice principal Tom Molinaro, who is known to often fall asleep during bus rides, thus increasing the chances of a fingering taking place. 'Remember, we're representing our school here.' According to students, the first fingering occurred Thursday at 8:32 a.m., when Jared Geyer, using a Middleton Football hooded sweatshirt for cover, fingered girlfriend Lacy DeWitt roughly 90 minutes into the six-hour trip to the nation's capital. 'I knew Jared was fingering her,' classmate Matt Shearer told reporters. 'They were laughing with each other and then they got real quiet.' Added Shearer, 'Before the trip Jared said he was going to finger her.' The second fingering reportedly took place Thursday night at the hotel after chaperones failed to notice that Nick Stern had been hiding in Jamie Cavanaugh's bathroom during a 10 p.m. room check. After the two chaperones left, Stern exited the bathroom and proceeded to finger Cavanaugh from approximately 10:13 p.m. to 10:17 p.m. Kelly Oswald, recipient of the trip's third confirmed fingering, was fingered by Greg Wandel on Friday behind the FDR Memorial. While the official count remains at three, students speculated that as many as 20 of their classmates have been or will be fingered before the trip's end. However, ninth-grade sources have ruled out any chance of 15-year-old Emily Blankenship being fingered, felt up, or even touched, for that matter. 'I guarantee Dave Hilland will finger Jessica Swink,' Geoff Schroyer told reporters, adding that Hilland fingered Swink during last summer's whale-watching trip in Boston. 'If not tonight, then definitely during the bus ride back. Either way, he'll finger her.' In addition to those who could be getting fingered at this very moment, four other students have reportedly been the object of attempted fingerings, one of which was interrupted when a chaperone entered the railcar exhibit at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. According to Jason Schilling, there was no actual finger insertion, though contact with pubic hair was made. Others who have been implicated in alleged fingerings include Allison Maida, whose whereabouts between 3:30 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. Friday remain unknown. 'She was probably getting fingered,' Joey Ross, 14, said. When last available for comment, students said that Michael Biller and Carrie Washburn had stayed behind as their tour group left a monumentthe name of which they could not recalland that the situation would likely end with Washburn being 'finger slammed.' 'I think these trips are so important because they get the kids out of their little bubble back at school,' said chaperone and ninth-grade history teacher Heidi DeWitt, whose daughter has been fingered twice during the excursion. 'Washington, D.C. is such an amazing city. I'm sure this will be an experience these kids will never forget.' ",0
"Who Owns the Organic Brands?Catherine J. Frompovich Regarding the defeat of GMO Labeling Proposition 37 in California in November of 2012,Common Dreams says this: Opposition of Proposition 37 was spearheaded by large agribusiness and chemical companiessuch as Monsanto and Dowand big food manufacturersincluding PepsiCo, Nestle, and Conagrawho dumped more than $45 million into the fight. Monsanto, a leading maker of genetically engineered seeds, contributed $8.1 million alone against the measure which would have required labeling on genetically modified food.(Source)[CJF Emphasis added] Recently, the apparent illegal activities of the Grocery Manufacturers Association in Washington State were uncovered, i.e.,the Grocery Manufacturers Association got caught red-handed violatingWashington state fair election laws by running a money laundering slush funddesigned to conceal the identities of food companies giving money to block I-522, as Mike Adams points out. Washington States Attorney General got involved, and suddenly GMA saw the light and divulged who was ponying up bucks to defeat I-522. The food companies involved are listed later on in this article. However, maybe it would be helpful if consumers everywhere, not just in Washington State, knew how many of the organic labels actually are owned by Big Agra firms. Keeping that ownership in mind, one ought to question what the method to their madness is. Realistically, they have the best of both worlds: profits from organic food labels and standard labels, since many of them own both, if not most of the organics. Questions about allowing the use of GMOs in organic food products have been buzzing around the industry for a long time, and the USDA addresses that in a series of articles. In its May 17, 2013 article Organic 101: Can GMOs Be Used in Organic Products?the USDA explains whats going on. According to CBS Money Watch, American companies that are part of our Grocery Manufacturers Association, household names like Kraft, Pepsi and Kellogg, have switched to natural colorings in their products in the U.K., where warning labels are required, but theyre not doing that here for the most part. Thats because no ones making them do it, and switching would cost a lot of money. And interestingly, Kraft, Coca Cola and Wal-Mart have already removed these artificial food colors and dyes from the products that they distribute in other countries. Theyve reformulated their product lines in other countries and no longer include these food dyes, and they did it in response to consumer demand and an extraordinary study called the Southampton Study. [1] If GMA food manufacturers can do it for food exports, why not for food stuffs sold here in the USA? The reason probably is because of their being in cahoots with the chemical industry. Chemical companies also pony up dollars to fight GMO labeling bills. It would seem that its about maintaining the chemicalization of the U.S. food supply.

"More guns are being seized in cities across Britain as the number of firearms being smuggled into the country increases, Britainâ€™s most senior police officer has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told a hearing at Londonâ€™s City Hall that a rise in gun crime in the capital was being put down to an increase in the number of weapons coming into the country. The Met seized a â€œworryingâ€ record number of weapons in 2015, including semiautomatic guns, Hogan-Howe said. â€œWeâ€™ve seized more firearms than ever before,â€ he said. â€œIn the previous year [2015] weâ€™ve seized 714 guns â€“ thatâ€™s around two per day. In a city this size, thatâ€™s a worrying number. This is an increase on previous years. Some of them are semiautomatic weapons, too. â€œIf you look around the big cities of the country, they are seeing a similar profile. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool â€“ they are seeing big rises as well.â€    Hogan-Howe pictured earlier this year with weapons seized by police officers in London. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA   The main supply route into the UK is across the continent from eastern European countries such as Albania and Lithuania, and significant seizures have recently been made of guns coming in from France. Hogan-Howe said: â€œWe are targeting with the National Crime Agency the supply routes. Itâ€™s either from abroad, itâ€™s stealing legally owned weapons in this country, sometimes youâ€™ve got to look at military supplies and also youâ€™ve got to look at licensed dealers.â€ Officers also monitor potential supply routes from the US, as well as the parcel post. Figures show there were 302 discharges of lethal barrelled weapons in London in the year to the end of August 2016 â€“ 91 more than in the previous year. There was also a leap of one-third in August 2016 compared with June. There were 46 discharges in both July and August.   Related: Number of stun guns seized at UK borders rises 70% in four years   In May, Hogan-Howe warned that the rise in the number of available guns meant terrorists had a greater chance of getting their hands on lethal weapons. Scotland Yard has launched a crackdown on gun crime hotspots, called Operation Viper, following a â€œsignificantâ€ increase in the number of shootings in the capital. In August the force introduced routine armed patrols in London in response to terrorist atrocities in mainland Europe.",1
"THURSDAY PUZZLE â€” There is a point in developing oneâ€™s solving skills where you finally get good enough to drop in quite a few answers without having to think about them very much and that, to be honest, is when most people get a little cocky. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that; confidence is a wonderful thing, especially when youâ€™ve spent so much time battling the grid.Sooner or later, however, you will meet your Waterloo, so to speak. For me, that Waterloo is any puzzle with a rebus element, or entries where more than one letter (or number or symbol) could fit inside one square. Iâ€™m just blind to them. I always know that something is wrong, because even though I think I know some of the answers, I cannot fill in my normal amount of gimmes or even guesses. My frustration level climbs. More chocolate than usual is required.But not today, my friends! I zeroed in on that â€œAGâ€ rebus in Mel Rosenâ€™s puzzle like a hunting dog, and it was the most satisfying feeling ever.Was it just easier? I would imagine it depends largely on whatâ€™s in your wheelhouse. But Iâ€™m going to go ahead and award myself a silver medal (for argentum, abbreviated AG) for tumbling to the trick early.There are 16 AG rebus elements in todayâ€™s theme, if you count both the Across and Down entries. Reading the Acrosses only, there are four entries with two AG rebuses each:And there are eight entries in the Downs with a single AG crosser:Itâ€™s a shame that all four of the Across double rebuses didnâ€™t have one AG in each word (BAGGAGE CLAIM contains both AGs in one word) and it seemed a bit odd to have the word AGAIN repeated in 27A to take advantage of the AG. Itâ€™s a very lively phrase, though.â–  6A: The word â€œDraftâ€ can have multiple meanings, but today it means to take a large SWIG of liquid.â–  19A: â€œE-con?â€ with a hyphen is not a class in economics, unless you are studying about how to get ripped off online. The answer here is SPAM, which is typically an online con.â–  24A: #TodayILearned that the leader of our armed forces is some guy named ARNIE. In all seriousness, the â€œNoted â€˜armyâ€™ leaderâ€ is Arnold â€œARNIEâ€ Palmer, the pro golfer who has a fan club and charitable foundation called ARNIEâ€™s Army.â–  32A: From the I Hope You Know Your Opera department: Hereâ€™s Maria Callas singing â€œVissi Dâ€™ARTE,â€ from the Puccini opera â€œTosca.â€â–  7D: If youâ€™re going to have a partial like WE A in a puzzle (from â€œArenâ€™t WE A pair?â€), it might as well be from Stephen Sondheimâ€™s â€œA Little Night Musicâ€:â–  37D: FLORISTS are â€œGlad handlers?â€ in the sense that â€œgladâ€ is short for â€œgladiolus.â€â–  44D: #NowIKnow that the â€œGertrude of 1926 newsâ€ is Gertrude EDERLE, the first woman to swim the English Channel.59D: At first, I honestly thought that â€œGolfoâ€ was some sort of game, but it turns out that itâ€™s actually Spanish for â€œgulf.â€ The answer is AGUA.Your thoughts?",1
"In an announcement that received wide attention throughout Wolverine's Tavern Tuesday, bar skanks Stephanie Fletcher and Jessica Keneally stated that they would share a passionate kiss at an unspecified time that evening. 'Steph and I are totally hot for each other,' Keneally said over the loud music to several unspecified bar patrons. 'We're going to make out. We don't care who's watching.' The skanks pose for one of the hundreds of pictures taken over the course of the night. According to eyewitnesses who looked up the second they walked in the door, the 22-year-old skanks arrived at the bar at approximately 10 p.m, dressed in their usual skank attire of low-cut tank tops paired with either low-rider jeans or a short skirt, and exposed, brightly colored thongs. After downing their third cosmopolitans, the two skanks stood up and began grinding to the R. Kelly song 'I'm a Flirt,' which caused a nearby conversation about the Cleveland Indians to come to a sudden halt. 'Quit staring,' Keneally said to the approximately 25 male patrons in the immediate vicinity, all of whom were by that time involuntarily ogling the skank-ass pair. 'Oh my God, you guys are such pervs.' Fletcher would neither confirm nor deny that the kiss would involve tongue, saying that bargoers 'would just have to wait.' The skank duo gyrates lasciviously as a growing crowd of men capture mental images for later use. 'Who knows what will go down,' Fletcher said as she reached into Keneally's tight top and tweaked her left breast with her thumb and middle finger in front of seven rapt onlookers. 'Possibly us.' In previous months, Keneally and Fletcher have, either separately or together, shown off their lower-back tattoos, held a loud conversation about who had the larger breasts, and displayed their oral sex techniques on bottles of Bud Light. Neither is a lesbian. 'Those chicks are all over each other awesome!' said 24-year-old Matt Lalley, one of dozens of slightly intoxicated males who, despite their highly evolved brains, were unable to stop looking at the suggestive twosome. 'This is going to be the best night of my life.' As the evening wore on, the skanks' hair grew lank and stringy, increasingly clinging to their sweaty faces despite frequent coquettish head tosses. The heat and close quarters of the small bar also caused the sparkly body makeup worn by Fletcher to collect in the crevices of her collarbone and between her breasts. According to Wolverine's bartender Helene Dorman, the skanks also left thick hot pink lipstick prints on their drink glasses. However, none of these factors resulted in any decrease in the amount of attention paid to the skanks. 'I just can't look away,' said Frank Sturm, watching as Keneally leaned over the pool table to display her plunging neckline for the ninth time. 'And the thing is, the one in the skirt isn't even all that hot.' 'I'd really like to think I'm above this,' Sturm's friend, Greg Kleist, added. 'But what can I say? I'm not. They're totally going to kiss.' Not everyone was as enthusiastic about the pair's announcement. A 28-year-old female bar patron rolled her eyes at the girls' predictable antics, and was immediately dismissed by Fletcher and Keneally as 'jealous.' The bartender reported that she'd seen similar scenes play out on countless other evenings. 'You mean the one that flashed her tits last week is gonna make out with the girl who was telling everyone she wasn't wearing any underwear?' Dorman asked while setting out newly washed glasses. 'Whatever.' As of press time, the pair had still not kissed, as they were rumored to be waiting for someone to buy them another drink before astonishing onlookers with their shocking intra-gender lip-lock. ",0
"Melania Says What She Thinks Of Michelle Obama Melania Trump, wife to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, has been noticeably silent during his presidential campaign. That does not mean she has not been supporting her husband relentlessly and silently behind the scenes. Recently, she agreed to participate in a rare interview about her husband. During her appearance, she was asked to comment about the current First Lady, Michelle Obama, who she might replace. I dont want to talk about that, Melania responded, demonstrating her class once again. For months now, Americans have been comparing Melania and Michelleand the contrast is stark. It is abundantly clear the Melania will be a better leader and supporter than Michelle has ever been, but she is above commenting on that. We can almost guarantee that if Michelle was asked about Melania, she would have less-than-pleasant things to say about her. What do you think? Do you applaud the potential First Lady for taking the high road on this one? Do you think shed be a great addition to the White House? ",0
"A select guide to cultural events for children, teenagers and families.â€˜The Amazing Maxâ€™ (Saturday and Sunday) Max Darwin, a.k.a. the Amazing Max, may come across like the M.C. at a raucous bar mitzvah party, but he does know his craft.

This exhibition, at the Childrenâ€™s Museum of Manhattan, aims to teach visitors 10 and under about a variety of Muslim communities. Divided into five sections, the show includes a global marketplace, an exploration of trade routes, a courtyard area and an investigation of architecture through different mosque styles.

The show explores his creative process â€” it includes animation cels, sketches, wire sculptures and a video â€” and how New York often became his muse.

Presented by the World Voices Program of the New Perspectives Theater Company, â€œThe Bad Birthdayâ€ chronicles the childrenâ€™s efforts to obtain ingredients with the help of their neighbors, who demand cake in return, leaving the twins with the prospect of none.

More than 100 works from 12 schools are in the show, which closes this weekend and includes drawings, paintings, collages, sculptures and installations. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org/ywc2016.â€˜Youâ€™re a Good Man, Charlie Brownâ€™ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) You may think youâ€™re utterly familiar with the â€œPeanutsâ€ gang and with this show, a musical adaptation of the groupâ€™s adventures from Charles M. Schulzâ€™s enduring comic strip. But this production, from the York Theater Company, is unusual: Here, Charlie Brown, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy and the rest of the characters are actually played by Broadway and Off Broadway veterans ages 9 to 13, instead of by adult actors. And with book, music and lyrics by Clark Gesner and additional material by Andrew Lippa and Michael Mayer, itâ€™s a staging that uses not just the 1967 original material but that also incorporates additions from the 1999 Broadway revival.

"University of Kentucky freshman Amy Austin demanded defensive end Ventrell Jenkins explain 'what's so great' about the AutoZone Liberty Bowl before she would consent to participate in sexual intercourse with him, sources reported Monday. 'Technically, it's not the championship, but it's a lot like a championship,' Austin's suitemates overheard Jenkins say. 'Trust me. It was an important game.' Jenkins also reportedly told the coed a trophy was awarded for the victory, and that this validated the game's significance. 'With the BCS, there's not just one winner,' he continued. 'We're all winners in, like, diverse ways. It's hard to explain, but there was confetti and shit. We're the 2009 AutoZone Liberty Bowl champs.... Hey, come here.' Austin reportedly put her clothes back on and left the room when Jenkins accidentally mentioned that Notre Dame had also played in a bowl game this year. ",0

"Aidan Oâ€™Brien is responsible for six of the 17 horses still engaged in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on Saturday, the 35th and final Group One race of the domestic turf season, but Capri, the Beresford Stakes winner, seems likely to be the centre of attention as the trainer attempts to end the campaign with a 37% strike-rate at the highest level in Britain.   Related: Tony Hind: The man Flat jockeys go to if they want to become champion   Mindingâ€™s success in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on Saturday was Oâ€™Brienâ€™s 12th Group One winner in England this season, and his 21st in all. He now needs four more to equal the American trainer Bobby Frankelâ€™s record of 25 top-level wins in a calendar year, and a successful two days at the Breedersâ€™ Cup meeting at Santa Anita next month, which has a total of 13 Grade One events, will be crucial if Oâ€™Brien is to reach or exceed Frankelâ€™s mark. A son of the brilliant racehorse who was named after Bobby Frankel is also among the possible runners at Doncaster on Saturday, as Frankuus, a Group Three winner at Chantilly this month, has been left in the reckoning by Mark Johnston, his trainer. Frankuus would be Frankelâ€™s first Group One winner as a stallion were he to win on Saturday, but he is a 16-1 outsider in the early betting, which is dominated by Capri at a best price of 11-8. Unlike Churchill, Oâ€™Brienâ€™s winner of the Dewhurst Stakes this month, Capri has plenty of stamina on both sides of his pedigree, as he is by Galileo out of a mare who won at 12 furlongs and was herself out of a dam who won a Group Two at the Derby trip. Oâ€™Brienâ€™s seven previous winners of the Racing Post Trophy include High Chaparral (2001) and Camelot (2011), both of whom took the Derby the following year, while he also saddled St Nicholas Abbey, one of the most successful performers of his training career, to win the British seasonâ€™s final Group One in 2001. The two most recent Group One races for juveniles in Britain both resulted in a one-two for Oâ€™Brien-trained horses and Capriâ€™s stable companion Yucatan, who was three-quarters of a length behind him in the Beresford Stakes at The Curragh in September, is the second-favourite for Saturdayâ€™s race at 5-1. William Haggasâ€™s Rivet, fifth of seven behind Churchill in the Dewhurst, is next in the betting at 7-1 while Salouen, the runner-up in the Prix Jean-Luc LagardÃ¨re at Chantilly on Arc day, is a 10-1 chance. The beaten horses behind Minding on Saturday included Galileo Gold, the 2,000 Guineas winner who finished fifth of the 13 starters, and Hugo Palmer, the coltâ€™s trainer, confirmed on Monday that he will get the chance to add to this yearâ€™s two Group One victories next season.   Related: Almanzor beats Found again to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot   â€œIt is very exciting for us,â€ Palmer said. â€œChampions like Galileo Gold are so rare and hard to find. When you find one, you want to hang on to them. Hopefully we can regain his early-season form next year. I donâ€™t think we could have won whatever we did on Saturday. Frankie [Dettori] and I discussed it beforehand and we decided that we were going to follow Jet Setting, as she was sure to go up the near rail and, indeed, she did go up there.Â  â€œAs it turned out, we probably should have followed Barchan into the race as he went a stronger gallop and it would have carried us further into the race.Â  â€œIf we had done things differently we could have perhaps finished closer to Minding.â€ Erupt, the winner of the Canadian International at Woodbine on Sunday, will have his next race in the Breedersâ€™ Cup Turf on 5 November. â€œIt has taken a bit of time this season to get everything right,â€ Alan Cooper, racing manager to the Niarchos family, which owns Erupt, said on Monday. â€œWe took a decision to bypass the Arc to make sure we had him fresh for an autumn campaign and that [on Sunday] was the first leg of it. â€œThe obvious one to go for is the Breedersâ€™ Cup Turf, we will get him home and see how he is before shipping him out again, but that is pretty much the idea.â€ Erupt is top-priced at 9-1 for the 12-furlong race in a market headed by Flintshire, at 2-1, and two Oâ€™Brien-trained contenders, Highland Reel and the Prix de lâ€™Arc de Triomphe winner, Found.",1
"Woody Allenâ€™s new TV show Crisis in Six Scenes launches on 30 September. Very little is known about the show, but one thing is certain: it wouldnâ€™t be an Allen project if it didnâ€™t contain at least a few of these trademark tropes. The middle classes! Overwhelmingly, Woody Allen protagonists are self-obsessed middle-class academics who punctuate all their conversations with highfalutin literary references. Itâ€™s hard to say if this will be the case here, but the minute-long teaser trailer did contain the word â€œnovellaâ€. Lovely scenery! Nobody has ever shot New York as well, or as comprehensively, as Woody Allen, and itâ€™s unlikely anyone has ever set so many films there. After his recent jaunts around the world, heâ€™s back in his home city for this new series. Plus, itâ€™s set in the 1960s so, regardless of quality, at least itâ€™ll look great. A creepy age gap!    They are almost definitely going to get it on â€¦ Allen with Miley Cyrus (as Lennie). Photograph: Amazon Prime   There was a 26-year age gap between Allen and Mariel Hemingway in Manhattan, a 33-year gap between him and Debra Messing in Hollywood Ending and a 41-year gap between Larry David and Evan Rachel Wood in Whatever Works. Miley Cyrus is 57 years younger than Woody Allen. They are almost definitely going to get it on.   Related: Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us. Thatâ€™s what has happened to me'   A bad Woody Allen impression! Thereâ€™s always one of these. Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity. John Cusack in Bullets Over Broadway. Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris. Jason Biggs in Anything Else. However, since Allen will star in Crisis in Six Scenes, hopefully the bad impression will be reserved for him. Windsor Light Condensed! This is a no-brainer. With the exception of Interiors, every Allen film since Annie Hall has featured this font. Crisis in Six Scenes proudly carries on the tradition, which is for the best. Imagine if it used Impact, Stencil or â€“ heaven forbid â€“ Matura M7 Script Capitals. Yuck. An enormous downer! Given Allenâ€™s fondness for miserable endings â€“ see Interiors, September, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Cassandraâ€™s Dream, Blue Jasmine, Irrational Man â€“ thereâ€™s a 30% chance that Crisis in Six Scenes will end with Cyrus becoming paralysed by the infinite cruelty of the universe and killing herself.",1
"Michelle Obama Picks A Fight With Donald, He Finally Unloads On Her In A Way She Never Expected Throughout his campaign, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has refrained from criticizing first lady Michelle Obama. That changed this week, when he went after both her and her husband for wasting time and resources campaigning for Hillary Clinton. We have a bunch of babies running our country, he commented at a rally in Fletcher, North Carolina. They are losers and they are babies, period. Why is Obama campaigning? he asked the public. He ought to be out working. All he wants to do is campaignand his wife, all she wants to do is campaign. Trump kicked his criticisms up a notch when he attacked Michelle for excoriating Clinton during the 2007 Democrat primaries. If you cant run your own house, you certainly cant run the White House, Michelle Obama said at the time, likely referring to Bills notorious sexual exploits. I see how much his wife likes Hillary, Trump commented at the rally. Buy wasnt she the one who originally started the statement, If you cant take care of your home or White House or the country? Of course, the media has expressed no outrage at this vicious statement. If Trump had said something like this, liberals would be up in arms. What do you think? Do you applaud Trump for calling Michelle out on her inconsistencies? ",0
"It takes a lot of heavy weather to snuff out the spark of Cameron Diaz who, at 41, still has the twinkle and bounce of an impish high school cheerleader. With her cornflower-blue eyes and mischievous feline grin, she remains every guyâ€™s ultimate gal pal. One of her gifts as an comic actor is a light touch.But in â€œThe Other Woman,â€ Ms. Diaz has her hands full. This female revenge comedy is so dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue (by the first-time screenwriter Melissa K. Stack). The movie is directed by Nick Cassavetes, who proves to be much more comfortable playing in soapsuds (â€œThe Notebookâ€) than managing a comedy. Although Ms. Diaz, as the movieâ€™s cool, cynical voice of truth, barely survives the debacle, you couldnâ€™t describe â€œThe Other Womanâ€ as a guilty pleasure the way you could â€œBad Teacher.â€In the opening scene, her character, Carly, a Manhattan corporate lawyer, skips into bed with her boyfriend, Mark (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, from â€œGame of Thronesâ€), a handsome investment banker, and they practically devour each other. Her euphoria is shattered, however, when, wearing hot pants and twirling a toilet plunger like a baton, she pays a surprise visit to Markâ€™s Connecticut home to help him with his plumbing problems. The doorbell is answered not by Mark but by his ditsy wife, Kate (Leslie Mann). Carly had no idea he was married.In one of the movieâ€™s many conceptual misfires, Ms. Mannâ€™s Kate is a whining, hysterical basket case. Although the role has a few charming moments, it is so overplayed that after a certain point you may want to put fingers in your ears to blot out her shrill, childish harangues. In one half-funny joke, Kate acknowledges that she needs to go to â€œbrain camp.â€ How about a hospital for a brain transplant?Eventually, Carly and Kate team up with Amber (Kate Upton), another of Markâ€™s extramarital playthings, who turn out to be numerous. The three begin plotting revenge. Amber is crassly shoehorned into the movie to provide jiggling eye candy for boys.â€œThe Other Womanâ€ settles into being a rip-off of the infinitely superior but still minor â€œFirst Wives Club,â€ in which Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn formed a similar team of women dispensing payback to rats. It begins with such lame stunts as (groan) lacing Markâ€™s drinks with laxative, which leads to a prolonged, poorly timed bathroom visit milked for maximum humiliation; putting hair remover into his shampoo; and dosing him with estrogen, which swells his nipples.The women, equipped with field glasses, trail Mark to Southampton and then to the Bahamas for some dirty financial dealings. Along the way, he emerges as not just a bad boy but a sociopathic monster. His ultimate comeuppance, which takes place in a conference room at Carlyâ€™s law firm, is the kind of sadistic free-for-all that passes nowadays for farce.As for Carlyâ€™s romantic future, never fear. When Kateâ€™s hunky unmarried brother, Phil (Taylor Kinney), appears early in the film, you know he is the designated prince in waiting. The best line in the movie is a remark by Nicki Minaj, making her live-action big-screen debut as Carlyâ€™s sassy office assistant, Lydia: â€œSelfish people live forever.â€â€œThe Other Womanâ€ is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and strong language.",1
"DEA Approves First-Ever Trial of Medical Cannabis for PTSD in Vets, Including Smoking ItBy Claire Bernish Non-profit organization MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, announced Thursday it will receive a grant of over $2.1 million from the State of Colorado to study the whole cannabis plant the first time any such study has been approved by federal agencies. We have been working towards approval since we opened the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA in 2010, explained Amy Emerson, Executive Director and Director of Clinical Research for the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation. We are thrilled to see this study overcome the hurdles of approval so we can begin gathering the data. The study is a critical step in moving our botanical drug development program forward at the federal level to gather information on the dosing, risks, and benefits of smoked marijuana for PTSD symptoms. According to MAPS, smoked cannabis with varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) will be administered in the placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety for 76 veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. As common with typical medicinal trials, the study will examine potential side effects, dosages, and the like, in order to provide clinicians and legislators with data they may need to institute cannabis treatment and effective policy. Founded in 1986, MAPS as its full name suggests has produced groundbreaking research into psychedelics and cannabis as treatments for a number of ailments. Known for exacting precise standards in its research, MAPS works closely with government agencies in the U.S. and abroad in order to maintain its ability to study drugs that might otherwise be considered illegal. Two years ago, MAPS lamented its lack of channels especially government grants for funding research, though the organization predicted shifting public perception would eventually facilitate a change. According to its website, despite previously lacking government funding, MAPS has raised $36 million since its founding for psychedelic and cannabis research. MAPS conducts ongoing research with psychedelics such as psilocybin found in magic mushrooms and LSD, which has yielded incredibly promising results for the treatment of PTSD, anxiety, and a number of other conditions. Ultimately, through the grant-funded study, MAPS seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of botanical marijuana as a prescription medicine for specific medical uses approved by the FDA. Sadly, paranoid stigmatization of cannabis has dictated drug policy and law for decades through the utterly failed war on drugs but MAPS has been helping to annihilate the stereotypes. If government funding an official cannabis study can be any indication, perhaps there will be ashift away from strictures regarding the miracle plant that is cannabis. Claire Bernish writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared. the DEA approves which means that they will again get in the way of the god given rights of the people Its not the first study..the first study was at University of Arizona two years ago.

"Not By Bread Alone Shall One LiveCatherine J Frompovich Todays wheat has been crossbred and tinkered with in many ways. According to nutritionist Natasha Longo, Natasha Longos excellent dissertation Why 80 Percent of People Worldwide Will Soon Stop Eating Wheat along with its apparent health-producing problems appears here. Ms. Longo does an excellent job of fulfilling all the requisites of journalism, i.e., answering most of the who, what, where, when, and why questions. Several issues concerning wheat need to be addressed. One, in particular, is giving children wheat-based snacks, i.e., cookies, pretzels, small finger-size goodies that can be harmful to digestive processes and toddlers intestinal tracts, which are not fully developed or in the process of becoming food-oriented much before two years of age, thus setting up a child for food problems. What needs to be pointed out, this writer thinks, is this: Giving infants and toddlers grains in any form to eat before children are able to chew grains and their flours well enough to provide saliva to ensalivate them, is not considered digestive-tract-friendly eating. Phytic acid in wheat is problematic for the gut, so that adds another dimension in addition to gluten problems, agricultural chemicals like glyphosate in GMO farming, and food processing chemicals, additives, and preservatives. The Weston A. Price Foundation provides an excellent primer on phytic acid and phytates here. According to an article in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, [1] humans are eating about 15 pounds of gluten per year, a 25 percent increase since the 1970s. In the chart on page 1157, its quite apparent how dramatically proteins in wheat have increased between 1925 and 1938, from 12.49% to 18.78% probably something Nature wasnt intending, but resulted from crossbreeding. Now, heres a question: If thats what happened from crossbreeding wheat, what is going on with, and from, genetically modified crops with their transgenic and cisgenic modifications, plus all the glyphosate spraying in the growing fields? This website differentiates between transgenic and cisgenic modifications Getting back to wheat, since the average slice of bread contains about 1.8 grams of gluten or 1800 mg, we need to realize that intestinal distress can occur quickly, since 50 to 100 mg of gluten per day can trigger celiac-diagnosed-patients, who are in remission, into intestinal distress. [2] However, many gluten-free foods are made with GMO ingredients like soy, corn, cornstarch, beet sugar, and chemical processing, manufacturing, and preservative additives that can interactor even trigger distresswithin an already celiac-compromised, gluten-intolerant gut. Furthermore, theres a wheat product called vital gluten, which is powdered gluten that is added to many foods, especially by professional bakeries and bakers. The closest grain to the original wheat Nature gave us is the heirloom wheat-like grain, spelt, which does contain gluten, but is more soluble than the gluten in wheat. That may be a defining factor for why spelt may work for some folks who are gluten sensitive, but needs to be considered very seriously. If one is gluten intolerant, it is best to be safe than sorry! The upshot or take-away information from this article is this: Wheat ought to be considered a dietary problem for anyone with any type of diseaseincluding obesityfrom digestive disorders to inflammatory diseases to allergies, especially young children who are on the autism spectrum disorder or have experienced any allergic reactions to vaccines, which can precipitate gut problems, digestive or intestinal distress. As a nutritionist who matriculated in natural nutrition and did research in prenatal and infant nutrition, this writer believes it is imperative that non-organically-grown food can be regarded as unsuspecting bioweapons capable of causing more disease and harm than we realize.

"The glitch, which occurred about 5 a.m. EST, prevented airlines from electronically entering their flight plans into a FAA computer in Salt Lake City that air traffic controllers around the country rely on for information. FAA officials blamed a failed circuit board in a networking system that is used to transfer flight data. Before it was corrected four hours later, air traffic controllers had to type up flight plans instead of obtaining them electronically, which slowed the air transportation system. An FAA computer center in Atlanta as well as 21 regional radar centers around the country were affected, officials said. Hit hard by the problem was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest commercial airport. The glitch aggravated delays caused by bad weather in the Northeast, while airports in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other parts of the South experienced cancellations and scheduling problems. Some flights were postponed more than two hours and on-time arrivals for some airlines plunged as much as 40 percent, according to information from FlightStats.com. AirTran canceled more than 30 flights and delayed scores more. Delta Air Lines canceled at least 54 flights and the operations of jetBlue Airways' slowed on the East Coast. American Airlines also delayed several hundred flights, company officials said. 'Operations are slowly returning to normal and we are working with impacted passengers,' Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Delta, said Thursday afternoon. 'Cancellations and delays are fairly minor, although we are continuing to assess our operations.' In response to Thursday's delays, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a prepared statement, saying the country's aviation system is 'in shambles' and the FAA needs more resources to prevent future problems and to modernize its equipment. 'If we don't deliver the resources, manpower, and technology, these technical glitches that cause cascading delays and chaos across the country are going to become a very regular occurrence,' he said. In August 2008, an electronic communication failure at an FAA site that processes flight plans for the eastern U.S. caused massive air traffic delays, especially in the Northeast. FAA officials blamed the malfunction on a software problem at a facility in Hampton, Ga. Ian Gregor, an FAA spokesman in Los Angeles, defended the agency, saying its equipment has been 'extremely reliable' and, on average, is in service more than 99 percent of the time. ",1

Seriously, I don't even know the lead singer's name.'

"Kill Switch Included on All Cell Phones Made in U.S. by 2015Melissa Melton Although the Smartphone Anti-Theft Voluntary Commitment is a voluntary program, apparently all the major players have already happily jumped on board: Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft, along with the five biggest cellular carriers in the United States, are among those that have signed on to a voluntary program announced Tuesday by the industrys largest trade group, reported CNN. And the supposed reasoning anti-theft sounds super phony, but just like everything else, its all for your safety of course: Well, now they wont even have to physically take your phone from you, because apparently theyll be able to just push a button and remotely wipe it clean of all data.

"I love to play with unusual ingredients and can't resist a novelty. After exploring avocado in my chocolate cupcakes, I have turned my attention to summer's round red fruit as the next cupcake ingredient. The practice of putting tomato in baked goods goes way back. Tomato soup showed up in the Campbell Soup Co.'s Mystery Cake recipe circa 1925. The canned stuff became a serious ingredient, along with many things boxed and packaged, in the '50s and '60s, when back-of-the-box recipes were all the rage. If you stop to read the back of Campbell's classic tomato soup, though, you'll find you're also getting high fructose corn syrup, salt and 'flavoring' (whatever that includes). So I was interested to see Akasha Richmond's take on a recipe for spiced cupcakes. She went the next logical step and used canned tomatoes instead of tomato soup. With it being the season and all, I thought of using fresh tomatoes. But the cooking process they go through before canning helps to concentrate the flavors and gives a balanced ratio between flesh and juice -- not to mention the ease of having it in your pantry ready to go any time. I did take liberties with the original recipe and used real cream cheese in place of the tofu cream cheese and butter in place of the vegetable shortening for the frosting. (Of course, you could sub those ingredients back in if you are watching your sat fats.) It makes a luscious topping and a cupcake with no apologies, rather than something you have to explain before people take the first bite. Tomato-Spice Cupcakes Makes 12 cupcakes MAKE AHEAD: Frosted cupcakes can be stored for 1 day at room temperature or refrigerated (covered) for up to 3 days. Adapted from 'Hollywood Dish,' by Akasha Richmond (Avery, 2006). For the cupcakes 2 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 cup canola oil 1 large egg 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon baking soda 14 ounces canned no-salt diced tomatoes, pureed in a blender until smooth For the frosting 1/2 cup (4 ounces) low-fat cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more as needed Pinch fine sea salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Fill a 12-cup muffin pan with paper baking liners. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cloves onto a sheet of waxed paper. Whisk together the oil, egg, sugar and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl, until the mixture is emulsified. Lightly whisk together the baking soda and pureed tomatoes in a separate bowl. Place a third of the flour mixture in a mixing bowl, then add half of the oil-egg mixture, stirring lightly to incorporate. In the following order, add a third of the flour mixture, half of the tomato puree mixture, the remaining oil-egg mixture, the remaining tomato puree mixture and the remaining flour mixture, stirring lightly after each addition. Use an ice cream scoop to fill each paper baking cup two-thirds full. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cupcake comes out clean. Transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Combine the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of standing mixer or hand-held electric mixer. Beat on medium-high speed for 1 minute, then add the confectioners' sugar and salt; beat for 4 minutes until the frosting reaches a spreadable consistency.

"Hospitals in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek are running out of supplies, particularly blood reserves, after treating hundreds of people wounded in an anti-government uprising, the Red Cross said Thursday. 'We immediately intervened at hospitals which contacted us through the ministry of health to provide blood. They have a shortage of blood and medication,' said Simon Schorno, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Schorno added that the supplies were immediately dispatched, but stressed that the ICRC's reserves onsite were 'minimal' and that emergency health kits are expected to be delivered Saturday. In a statement, the ICRC also said that it was 'working with our Kyrgyz Red Crescent partners on ways to improve blood collection.' The relief agency estimated that the three main hospitals in Bishkek are treating more than 500 people wounded in the uprising on Wednesday which led to the toppling of strongman President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. The Krygyz health ministry said that about 1,000 had been wounded and 75 killed in the violence. A medical team is also to be dispatched to the northern town of Talas to 'better understand' medical needs on the ground, said Schorno. The agency, which has 35 staff members in Kyrgyzstan, also called on the parties in the conflict to show 'restraint and respect the principle of humanity.' ",1
"Murderer Being Prosecuted After Intentionally Killing And Injuring 40 In Car Crash Las Vegas has unfortunately been the home to the most recent attack. Although police have determined that it is unlikely to be a terrorist attack, they have confirmed that the crash was intentional and they are investigating the crime further. A female driver turned into the sidewalk, smashing into about 40 people. One died on the scene, 4 are in critical condition, and the rest have been taken to the hospital for non-critical injuries. Las Vegas Blvd. has been completely shut down. Some people announced via social media that they heard shootings, but after further investigation police have said that this is unlikely. The driver attempted to flee the scene in her vehicle after hitting dozens, and police have apprehended her. They are currently testing her for drugs and alcohol, as well as screening her background for terrorist ties. Is the death penalty appropriate for running over dozens of people? ",0
"Baltimore â€” THE International Olympic Committee recently announced that 10 refugee athletes from troubled or war-torn nations would be allowed to compete in the summer Olympic Games. The committee believes that the group, officially known as the Refugee Olympic Team, will serve as a â€œsymbol of hopeâ€ in Rio de Janeiro.The I.O.C.â€™s action to field a refugee team is an example of the Gamesâ€™ spirit at its best â€” using sport to transcend politics and promote human dignity. The decision also comes at a crucial moment when the Olympic movementâ€™s fundamental values seem under attack. Few issues exemplify the crisis more than the allegations of state-supported doping in Russia.For this reason, the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations must use their authority to grant a similar special eligibility status to another athlete. In this competitorâ€™s case, it is not because she has been forced to flee a conflict zone, but because her moral actions have helped to preserve the integrity of the Olympic movement itself.That athlete is Yuliya Stepanova, a brave whistle-blower on organized doping in Russian athletics. On Friday in Vienna, an I.A.A.F. task force will report on whether Russia should be permitted to send a track-and-field team to Rio. The panel will also consider whether Ms. Stepanova should be allowed to compete in Rio as an independent competitor, like the refugee athletes.Ms. Stepanova is an accomplished 800-meter runner from Russia. Because she was a medal contender at the international level, she was, in her words, considered â€œuntouchable.â€ In Russia, that meant an athlete who was doped, with the knowledge of her coaches and sports federation, with performance-enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids and the blood-boosting agent EPO, and who was protected from drug-testing controls within her country.All that changed in 2012. After Ms. Stepanova was injured, the Russian athletics federation stopped protecting her. In 2013, she received a two-year ban from the I.A.A.F. after abnormalities were found in her Athlete Biological Passport, which provides a physiological baseline on every athlete to help identify possible doping.After much soul-searching, Ms. Stepanova decided to come clean. She chose not to seek a lighter punishment by invoking a provision of the World Anti-Doping Code that permits the World Anti-Doping Agency to reduce sanctions for athletes who provide assistance to antidoping efforts. Instead, she served her ban and joined her husband, Vitaly Stepanov, then an antidoping official, in the risky task of amassing evidence of officially sanctioned Russian doping.Together, they provided WADA with credible evidence of systemic cheating. Because of their whistle-blowing, the Stepanovs feared for their lives and fled the country, eventually settling in the United States.Ms. Stepanova has continued to train on her own, returning to competition and earning an Olympic-qualifying time. She has been part of the pool of elite athletes subject to unannounced, out-of-competition testing, and has tested clean. Ms. Stepanova should therefore be considered fully eligible to compete, yet she cannot go home or run for her country.To maintain its credibility as a proponent of clean sport, the International Olympic Committee must grant Ms. Stepanova the right to compete in Rio independently of Russia. And for the future, the bodies that govern international Olympic competition must establish a new mechanism to protect whistle-blowers like the Stepanovs.There are currently no rules in the World Anti-Doping Code or the Olympic Charter to protect these vital truth-tellers. The Russian track-and-field scandal could not demonstrate more clearly how much the enforcement of the WADA code in individual countries relies on international governing bodiesâ€™ ability to protect whistle-blowers.WADA alone cannot monitor compliance in every country, and the Russian scandal has exposed grave failures in its governance. But relying on each national federationâ€™s antidoping efforts is clearly problematic. Some countries, like Britain, Canada and the United States, have antidoping bodies with the funding and political capital to police doping effectively, to test and punish athletes who cheat. But others, like Russia, pay lip service to antidoping measures while fostering a culture of cheating.As we see from the allegations about how antidoping tests at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics were an elaborate charade, it is only through the efforts of principled inside informants like Ms. Stepanova that the truth can come to light. It would make a mockery of the Olympic movement to deny an athlete who has taken enormous personal risks for the cause of clean sport the ability to participate in the Rio Olympics. To do so would, in effect, punish her for speaking the truth and upholding the World Anti-Doping Code and Olympic ideals.Nearly two decades ago, the establishment of WADA and the adoption of its code were historic steps toward preserving the integrity of clean sport. But Russiaâ€™s systemic doping has proved the need for further reform. Whistle-blower protections are the logical next step. Granting Ms. Stepanova the right to participate in Rio would go a long way toward ensuring that the Olympics lived up to the ideals of its charter.The I.O.C.â€™s generous move in admitting a refugeesâ€™ team matches the spirit of the Games. So let the committee also extend that grace to a runner who has already proved herself an Olympic champion.",1

"The Alfred B. Nobel Foundation's annual awards ceremony was enhanced Friday with the addition of the first-ever Nobel Prize For Ripped Abs. Laguna Beach, CA, personal trainer Ron Seaver (right) accepts the inaugural Nobel Prize For Ripped Abs from Sweden's King Karl Gustaf. The new category was established by the Nobel Committee to honor outstanding achievement in the areas of upper abs, lower abs and obliques. Of the thousands of scientists, authors and university professors from around the world who were nominated, the inaugural Nobel Prize For Ripped Abs was awarded to Laguna Beach, CA, personal trainer and mountain biking enthusiast Ron Seaver, 28. 'Thank you very much,' Seaver said upon receiving the gold Nobel medallion from Sweden's King Karl Gustaf. 'Basically, what I try to do is five sets of 30 to 40 crunches every day, alternating between slow, low-reps of incline sit-ups to work the slow-twitch muscle fibers and quick, high-rep crunches to work the fast-twitch muscle fibers. In between sets I like to mix it up with cardiovascular workcycling, swimming, even rollerblading.' Seaver then turned serious, adding: 'It's very important to take at least one day a week off. Down time is when your muscles actually do all of their rebuilding.' Nobel Committee members, including professors from the University of Helsinki, Yale University and the famed Karolinska Institute, were impressed with the angled, defined corners on Seaver's abs, and the visible sinew beneath his trim, toned 'six-pack.' Nobel Committee Chair Grueder Halstrm, Fellow of the Danish Academy of Sciences in Copenhagen, said: 'Mr. Seaver has great abs. His tireless dedication to his abdominal region is apparent in a 'washboard stomach' that is more ripped than any other in the world of modern abs.' In his presentation speech to Seaver, King Gustaf said: 'Your ripped abs are an inspiration to all of mankind. They will get all the citizens of the world 'psyched' to work their own abs harder.' An appreciative Seaver told the assembled crowd that it was 'a great honor' to receive the Nobel Prize. 'There are so many other people out there who would have been just as deserving of this award. My workout partner, Mitch, has incredible definition. Bruce Bloch, who works out at Gold's Gym over in Santa Cruz, is every bit as ripped as me, and he has even better symmetry.' Seaver also thanked his longtime mentor, Russian physicist Pavel Cherenkov, winner of the 1958 Nobel Prize For Physics, who died last December. 'Pavel taught me everything I know,' a visibly buffed Seaver said. 'He taught me to keep my knees together, elbows in, and never to cheat by anchoring my legs. I just know he's up there somewhere, totally juiced right now.' Moved to tears, Seaver stepped down from the platform and carbo-loaded. Many of the world's leading political and intellectual figures in attendance at the ceremony were both moved and motivated by Seaver's acceptance speech. 'After seeing Mr. Seaver up there, I realize that my stomach could use some work,' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said. 'Ever since re-unification I have been making excuses, saying that I do not have time to worry about getting rid of my love handles. Well, I can ignore this problem no longer.' 'If I do not start doing sit-ups soon,' said Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 78, 'I will not be in shape for the coming swimsuit season.' Men's Health reporter Bradley Simmons covered the Nobel Prize ceremony for the magazine. 'Seaver was the clear choice in the Ripped Abs Category,' Simmons said. 'His abs are totally cut. Look for him on the cover of the next issue of Men's Health in connection with our late-breaking piece on how to flatten your tummy in just 10 weeks.' Seaver plans to use his $950,000 prize money to travel throughout the Third World teaching the poor how to add definition to their abs. ",0
"Following dozens of complaints from waitstaff and numerous incidents of property damage over the past 10 years, representatives from the Dave & Buster's corporation, a bar-restaurant chain offering a wide variety of arcade games, announced today that Vice President Joe Biden has been permanently banned from all 55 locations nationwide. Biden refused to leave 'without a fight,' forcing staff to physically remove the 36-year Senate veteran. The lifetime ban came after a heavily intoxicated Biden was forcibly ejected from a Bethesda, MD Dave & Buster's earlier this week for destroying a Whac-A-Mole game, which the vice president claimed had been 'rigged.' According to the ensuing police report, Biden became verbally abusive when asked to leave, calling several employees 'a bunch of killjoy cocksuckers.' 'We are saddened that such extreme measures had to be taken in regard to the vice president's recent behavior,' said Dave & Buster's spokesman David Weldon, adding that posters with Biden's image on them have been distributed to all locations. 'However, Mr. Biden has been given many, many chances to act in a responsible and respectful manner while enjoying the great food and fun that Dave & Buster's has to offer. Unfortunately, he has failed to do so time and again.' 'In the interests of the safety and well-being of our patrons and staff, we must insist that the vice president never set foot in another Dave & Buster's ever again,' Weldon continued. The nation's second-in-command expressed his displeasure with Spin N Win's 'bullshit' ticket payout system. Though the scope and severity of the ban are unprecedented, Weldon said that several individual Dave & Buster's locations have previously expelled Biden for lengths ranging from six weeks to two years, with the first occurring in Dover, DE in 1990. According to records, Biden visited that location while campaigning for his fourth Senate term, and kicked over a Galaga arcade game after getting into a verbal altercation with a server over a $16 tab. Bans from Dallas, Minneapolis, and Denver locations followed, with the most notable interdict coming in 2006 at the high-profile Dave & Buster's restaurant in Times Square. Sources said that Biden, attending the grand opening of the establishment, asked several waitresses if they wanted to 'get a daisy chain going' and then placed two Skee-Balls down the front of his cutoff jeans. After being confronted by a manager, Biden reportedly threw several air-hockey disks into the dining area as an ill-conceived distraction and was tackled by a security guard while running toward the exit. 'He was loud but basically not bothering anyone at first,' said Miami Dave & Buster's manager Rick Perelson, who was forced to ban Biden from his restaurant in 2002in part for physically ousting a 14-year-old from a Dance Dance Revolution arcade game. 'That is, until he got really drunk and started telling other customers what they should order.' 'And after what he did to the bathroom, I was really left with no choice,' Perelson continued. 'Just disgusting.' According to other Dave & Buster's employees, Biden has not historically respected the bans that have been placed on him. After he was barred from the Tempe, AZ location in 2007, the former senator would reportedly do burnouts in the parking lot with his Trans Am while waiting to pick up a waitress employed there at the time, a woman identified only as 'Candi.' Though Biden's problems with the Dave & Buster's company appear to be unique among those who have held his office, he is not the first vice president to run afoul of a business. In a famous case in 1869, Schuyler Colfax was barred from entering any location of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company in the state of New York after a series of episodes involving the upending of pickle barrels. And Spiro Agnew was told to 'never set foot again' in the Children's National Medical Center of Washington following a 1971 incident. Despite having described Dave & Buster's as his favorite restaurant dozens of times in the past, Biden is evidently unperturbed by the lifetime ban. 'The vice president wouldn't patronize that glorified Chuck E. Cheese's if it were the last place on earth,' Biden aide Jim Tomlin told reporters at a press conference earlier today. 'Who gives a crap about that stupid dump?' 'Besides, his 15-year ban from the Hustler Club is up next month, so it doesn't really matter anyway,' Tomlin added. ",0

"Saying hes seen a lot of people come through here in [his] day and met prisoners of every type, longtime Louisiana State Penitentiary death row guard Dwayne McFadden confided Wednesday that hes always had a bit of a soft spot for the innocent ones. While the 57-year-old corrections officer said he strives to remain detached and professional when dealing with inmates awaiting execution, he told reporters that, invariably, the men convicted of capital crimes they didnt commit somehow always manage to find a way into his heart, remaining there even after they are put to death. When youve been here as long as I have, you start to develop a special relationship with the guys who arent actually guilty, said McFadden, noting that there have been so many such inmates during his 30 years on the job he has lost exact count. You get to know them, know their stories. And as they keep exhausting appeal after appeal, you cant help but take a liking to them. Even though its against prison rules, Ill sometimes let the innocent guys have an extra 10 minutes in the yard, or maybe a couple extra library books, he added. Little gestures here and there. Its the least I can do for them. McFadden acknowledged he has felt a personal and enduring emotional connection to virtually every one of the not-guilty death row inmates he has known, from those assigned shoddy public defenders who failed to secure a plea deal, to those sentenced on the basis of clearly fabricated police evidence and later-recanted testimony, to those who were mentally unfit to stand trial in the first place. Often, he said, the prisoners who have stirred something inside him have been the ones who had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or were forced to sign confessions after being kept awake for dozens of hours of harsh, coercive questioning. Additionally, McFadden added that many of his favorite inmates over the years were simply victims of a bygone era before the use of DNA tests became standard. Most of them are just these real nice guys from poor, tough neighborhoods, though Ive seen falsely convicted men from all walks of life behind these walls, McFadden said of the maximum-security facilitys death row population. Interesting thing is, no matter where they come from, or what their background, the innocent ones all have this same look in their eyes that really melts your heart. It gets me every time, he continued. They really are some of the sweetest people youll ever meet. The guard explained that while all of the individuals under his watch are damaged on some level, and the worst are merciless killers for whom there is no place in society, the ones who are not actually murderers tend to be much more likable. According to McFadden, when these inmates loudly protest their imprisonment or lash out physically in defiance of the system that has wronged them, he always feels a twinge of sadness whenever he has to pepper-spray them into submission and then forcibly pin them against the floor until they are shackled. You cant help but feel for these guys as people when youre keeping them under 24-hour suicide watch in the days leading up to their execution, he said, adding that a nod and a little wave goes a long way when an innocent man is being led to his death. I have to say, I get kind of attached to them, and I miss them when theyre gone. But most of the time, that feeling doesnt last too long, he added. There are always more coming in. ",0
"Cyprus President Demetris Christofias was admitted to hospital on Tuesday after feeling indisposed. He is being treated at a Nicosia hospital where doctors said he is comfortable. A doctor at the hospital said initial examinations on the president are satisfactory but he will stay in hospital for further tests. Sources said the president felt indisposed around mid-day and had to cancel some official appointments. The sources said the president's condition was probably caused by fatigue, due to his exhaustive program on Monday, which included a meeting with visiting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and three-way talks with the UN chief and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. He also attended a following joint press conference and a reception for representatives from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities with the presence of Ban, who was in the divided island to push the slow-moving peace process.

"Amazonâ€™s Echo voice-controlled smart speaker is finally available in the UK, but was the wait worth it? The Echo (find here) is one of the first devices with Amazonâ€™s voice assistant â€“ a rival to Appleâ€™s Siri, Googleâ€™s Assistant and Microsoftâ€™s Cortana â€“ which allows you to control music playback just by speaking to it and a whole lot more. What is it?    Ask Alexa for the weather and sheâ€™ll tell you whatâ€™s what, but the Alexa on your smartphone app will also fire up with more detail. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   Echo is three devices in one. Itâ€™s a voice-controlled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker capable of playing music from Amazon music, a Spotify premium account or a smartphone, tablet or computer connected via Bluetooth. Itâ€™s also a smart voice assistant called Alexa thatâ€™s capable of answering queries, setting timers, doing calculations, telling you the weather or whatâ€™s in your calendar and other bits you might expect from Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant. It also has third-party app integrations that allow users to interact with the National Rail app for train times and other similar services. Finally, Echo is smart-home controller that can turn devices on and off, set scenes and other internet of things functions just by saying: â€œAlexa, turn on the living room light.â€ What does it look like?    The top ring lights up: blue when listening to you; red when muted, which is clearly visible from across the room. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   Standing 23.5cm tall with a diameter of 8.4cm, the Echo is a small tower speaker available in black or white. When not active it simply looks like a black perforated tube, but when spoken to a ring of lights up top sparkle to indicate activity, state and whether itâ€™s listening to your barked orders. In its base are two down-firing speakers - one tweeter and one 2.5in woofer - producing 360-degree audio. At the top are two buttons, one for performing actions and the other for muting the voice recognition. A rotating ring at the top acts as a volume control, but in truth you never need to use it or the action button. It sounds pretty good for a single 360-degree speaker. Itâ€™s not going to please audiophiles or beat a good pair of speakers, but it is fully capable of filling a room with pretty good sound. Itâ€™s not quite as good as a Sonos Play 1, which also costs Â£150, but then it is doing a lot more for the same price. The real magic is the hidden in the top. An array of seven microphones work in conjunction to do whatâ€™s called beam forming â€“ isolating a sound coming from a particular direction by cancelling out all other noise. The mic array means Alexa can hear you even when playing music at full blast, or in my case, from the other end of the kitchen while the washing machine, oven and dishwasher are all going. I was constantly amazed that it could hear me from the front door, all the way down the other end of my long and narrow terraced house. What does it do?    The blue ring of lights shows that the Echo is actively listening to you and streaming your speech to the cloud to interpret what youâ€™re trying to say. The white light shows you where the speaker thinks your voice is coming from. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   All you need to do to activate Echo is say its wake word - Alexa, Echo or Amazon, you get a choice - and it will begin listening to your dulcet tones. Say â€œAlexa, play some Tychoâ€ and it will start playing a playlist of tracks from Tycho from Amazon Prime music, presuming you have a Prime account or Amazon Music Unlimited if youâ€™re a subscriber. In the UK you can also listen to music from a Spotify premium account, which can be set to default or be used instead of Prime by just saying â€œfrom Spotifyâ€ at the end. TuneIn for radio or the Radioplayer are also available if youâ€™re just after some general music. Once music is playing, saying â€œAlexa, turn up the volumeâ€ does what you might expect. The remarkable thing is that the array of mics picks you up even when it is blasting music at full volume. Or in my case, playing music loud enough to drown out the cooker hood extractor fan. You can skip tracks, of course, switch to radio through TuneIn, or play music via a Bluetooth source. It can do other useful basic things, such as set timers, alarms and tell you the time, which is more useful than you might think if youâ€™re cooking.    If adjusting the volume via voice is a bit of a faff, the top ring twists for instant volume control with the light ring indicating the current level. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   Alexa has access to a wealth of data too. You can ask it questions, get the weather, the latest news or sport scores, find out when the next game is on or check a calendar that youâ€™ve connected through the Alexa app on your phone. Here is where Echo is both amazing and not quite there. It can answer more questions correctly than Appleâ€™s Siri in my testing, but canâ€™t quite match the sheer volume of data that Googleâ€™s Assistant has access to. Alexa will normally understand the question, but doesnâ€™t have the answer. Itâ€™s not like it can simply show you a web search. Amazon also supports third-party apps called â€œskillsâ€, which are installed using the Alexa app on your smartphone. Once added, asking Alexa to open or ask the skill a question provides you with all sorts of features. The Guardian skill, for instance, can read you the latest headlines from the Guardian, play podcasts and give you a flash-style update on whatâ€™s going on. You can navigate sections and more. The National Rail skill can give you an update on your commute via rail, or specific train times. Out of the box Alexa can give you traffic updates for road commutes and the weather, of course. The Tube Status skill does what it says on the tin, but if itâ€™s all horrible then the Uber skill can order you a taxi. There are cocktail skills that can read out the ingredients for a Tom Collins. Anything much more complicated than that though and youâ€™ll need a pen and paper - at which point you might as well use your phone. The Jamie Oliver skill reads out recipes, but suffers from a similar problem, so itâ€™s a lot easier to enable the Just Eat skill and ask Alexa to â€œask Just Eat to re-order my last Chineseâ€. There are more trivia, fact, joke and other random entertainment skills than you can shake a stick at, while the Sound Machine skill can give you applause on demand for when you need a pat on the back.    Hit the mute button and the microphones are electrically disconnected. As long as the light ring and mute button are lit up in red, Echo and Alexa cannot hear you. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   The longer I had Echo in my kitchen the more I got used to it just being there and being able to do things quicker and more easily than I could, but it took until I was alone in the house, midway through a DIY project, hands full of tools, covered in rubbish, bent in an awkward position to reach something and needing a calculation to proceed that I realised that voice assistants in the home were the future. I couldnâ€™t reach my phone, I was tired and even on a good day I wouldnâ€™t be able to tell you what 57.5 divided by five was. So I simply shouted - I was pretty stressed at this point - â€œAlexa, whatâ€™s 57.5 divided by fiveâ€ and from across the room out she bellowed â€œ11.5â€. I marked and I cut and the job was done. Could a phone have done that? Of course. Could it has heard me talking through furniture and at the other end of the room? Probably not. Would I have done that in public, absolutely not, but the home is the perfect place for a voice assistant. Smart Home    Your devices, groups and smart home skills are all configured through the Alexa app. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   Arguably the most interesting set of skills for Alexa are the ones for integrating various smart-home devices. Thereâ€™s nothing quite as cool as walking into a room and saying â€œAlexa, lights on in the kitchenâ€ and it happening as if by magic. Of course, it depends on which devices you already have or are intending to buy. Skills exist for Nest, Hive, Honeywell, Tado, LightwaveRF and LIFX; the Echo works out of the box Philips Hue and soon on Sonos too, although thereâ€™s a Hue skill available for more advanced features such as scene control. Alexa also has integration with Samsungâ€™s Smartthings Hub, which means that anything supported by Smartthings, which is basically everything, can be hooked up to the Echo through the Smartthings Hub. Setting it up is both simple and complicated. Going into the Alexa app and adding skills is easy, so is setting discovery, or you can simply say â€œAlexa, discover devicesâ€ and sheâ€™ll do as required. Theyâ€™re all listed in the Alexa app, which if you have even just a few smart bulbs can easily produce a massive list. For instance, each scene available for each bulb is listed as a separate entry. I easily had more than 150 entries in my smart home list with duplications - Hue bulbs showed up once from the Hue skill and again from the Smartthings Hub. You can configure whatâ€™s visible and what isnâ€™t to Alexa within the various skills, or make Alexa forget them directly. You have to do it one-by-one, which is rather time consuming.    The Echo is available in black or white. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian   You also have to consider what you call all your devices. You have to be able to say them easily and Alexa has to be able to understand what youâ€™re on about. Numbering lights one, two and three in each room doesnâ€™t work well, for instance. If you tell Alexa to turn off the bedroom light, but you have more than one light in the room called bedroom light, she will ask which one. The easiest thing to do is to call each light or device something separate and then group them together within the Alexa app. I grouped all my devices into a massive group called â€œhouseâ€ . This meant I could walk out the door and shout â€œAlexa, house offâ€ and everything would turn off. I also created groups for individual rooms, upstairs, downstairs and the hallway, so that they were easy to command for each place in my house. The groups overlapped so that I could command more than one roomsâ€™ lights in one go. It took a bit of thought to work out what was going to be easy to remember and say, but was well worth it. Observations  Alexa differentiates between the singular and plural of words - light versus lights elicits different responses Talking to it like a human gets better results than like a robot in sentence structure The Alexa app on your phone is relatively slow - use it where you have solid Wi-Fi House guests were amazed by Echo - it is definitely a statement piece in a house You can buy products from Amazon via voice, which works just fine if you know what youâ€™re after, but itâ€™s a lot easier to just pull out a smartphone in most instances  Price The Amazon Echo is available in either black or white for Â£149.99 (buy here). The only other similar competitor is Google Home, which is not yet available in the UK, but costs $129 (Â£104) in the US. Verdict The Amazon Echo is a device that once you get into your home youâ€™ll find more and more uses for it. The question is really whether it does something thatâ€™s interesting or useful enough for you to buy it. Itâ€™s a pretty good speaker, but not the best. It has fantastic voice recognition and can hear you from anywhere over anything. It will pretty much always understand what youâ€™re saying but canâ€™t always help you out with it. It has third-party apps for most things and more appear each day. Is voice the best way to access everything? No. Is it the most convenient for a lot of things? Absolutely. The potential privacy implications of having an internet-connected listening device in your home aside, having something that understands you and just does what you need nine times out of 10 is brilliant. The Echo is the best voice assistant-come-speaker you can buy in the UK at the moment. But it wonâ€™t be the only one in the near future. Googleâ€™s Home has the advantage of access to more data than anything else on the planet, but data is only one part of the equation. Being able to hear and understand you every time is the most important thing for a voice-only object and Amazon has absolutely nailed that with Echo.  Pros: can almost always hear you, mute button electrically disconnects the mics, rotating light ring obvious, lots of third-party apps, sounds pretty good, sounds more human than any other voice assistant Cons: canâ€™t always answer the question, always-listening object in your house, doesnâ€™t support multiple user calendars or personal information, only one Spotify or Amazon music account can be linked at any one time  Other reviews  Samsung SmartThings Hub review: an Internet of Things to rule them all?

"The escalating story of sexual abuse in football is now threatening to take in Newcastle United after a former player contacted the police to allege he was another victim on the back of growing concerns about a possible paedophile ring in the sport. The ex-player, whose identity is known to the Guardian, has named George Ormond as the offender, claiming that he was sexually abused by a man who has already had a six-year prison sentence for a string of convictions involving boys from the clubâ€™s youth system over a 24-year period.   Related: Pictured: serial paedophile Barry Bennell in his time as Manchester City talent-spotter   The complainant has been inspired to report the alleged abuse after the Guardian brought to light abuse suffered by former players elsewhere. That began when the former Crewe Alexandra defender Andy Woodward waived his right to anonymity last week to reveal the harrowing accounts of the sexual abuse he endured from the coach, scout and serial paedophile Barry Bennell. Another former Crewe player, Steve Walters, followed suit to tell the Guardian a story of disturbing similarity. David White, best known for his long association at Manchester City, has subsequently come forward to reveal he was another of Bennellâ€™s victims and another former England international, Paul Stewart, has said he was targeted by a separate man who was working in junior football in the Manchester area. A spokesman for Northumbria Police told the Guardian: â€œWe have received a report in relation to an allegation of historic [sic] sexual offences in Newcastle. We are working closely with, and supporting, the victim and enquiries are ongoing.â€ Ormond was branded a â€œpredatory abuserâ€ by the judge at Newcastle crown court when he was imprisoned, aged 46, in 2002 at the end of a trial that heard how a man once regarded as a highly respected coach in youth circles used his standing to bring youngsters under his power. His case has similarities in that respect with Bennellâ€™s time as a youth-team coach at Crewe and Whiteâ€™s ordeal at Whitehill FC, a junior team affiliated to Manchester City. Bennell, who also had links with Stoke City, coached sides in Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire, but it is only now that the full extent of his crimes is becoming apparent. Woodward believes there could be hundreds of victims and a new NSPCC hotline for footballers, opened with the support of the Football Association, received more than 50 calls in the first two hours. Wayne Rooney, the England and Manchester United player and an NSPCC ambassador, said: â€œItâ€™s awful that some of my colleagues have suffered this way whilst playing the sport that I and they love. Andy has been really brave to come forward and I would encourage anyone who has or is suffering from abuse to call the NSPCCâ€™s new football helpline. Itâ€™s important that people know that itâ€™s ok to speak out, there is help available and that they donâ€™t need to suffer in silence.â€     Football child abuse victim Steve Walters: itâ€™s time for justice  Last week two other former players, speaking to the Guardian, independently named another man from the football world who had abused them, and Cheshire police reported on Wednesday that 11 people had contacted them to talk about the Bennell case. The Guardian is aware of many others who have been abused but chosen not to come forward, including one case where the victim has decided it would be too upsetting for his elderly mother to find out. Ormond denied 15 charges of indecent assault on seven boys, five of whom were under the age of 16, between 1975 and 1999. He was convicted of 12 indecent assaults and one attempted indecent assault after having earlier been acquitted of the other attacks on the directions of the judge. The police investigation into his crimes began after one of the victims secretly recorded a conversation between them, more than a decade after the attacks, and Ormond could be heard apparently apologising. The court was told that Ormond, who argued he was the victim of a conspiracy among his accusers, was â€œwholly preoccupied with sexâ€ and carried out his attacks at various locations including youth-club changing rooms, his car and at the homes of some victims. Sentencing Ormond, the judge, Esmond Faulks, told him: â€œThe evidence demonstrates you were a predatory abuser of young boys. You used your position as a football coach to target vulnerable young children. You ingratiated yourself with their parents and prevented disclosure by the power you wielded over them as their coach.â€ Newcastle issued a statement on Friday which said: â€œAt this time, the only information we have is that which appeared in the Guardian newspaper. Clearly Newcastle United will cooperate fully with the police and relevant authorities and provide every assistance we can if or when the club receives further information.  â€œThe club would encourage anyone with information about possible child abuse in our game to report their concerns to the police, the football authorities or the NSPCC. The FA has commissioned in conjunction with the NSPCC a specific helpline for individuals who wish to come forward with further information.â€  â€¢ The NSPCCâ€™s hotline is 0800 023 2642 and Child Line for children and young people can be contacted on 0800 1111. â€¢ NAPAC, the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, can be contacted on 0808 801 0331. â€¢ In the UK, The Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.",1
"In a race against time, local emergency crews reportedly rushed to rescue Italian figure skater Carolina Kostner Wednesday after the Olympian plunged through a hazardous thin patch of ice during her short program at the Iceberg Skating Palace. Unfortunately she skated way out into the middle of the rink where the ice was weak and it collapsed instantly when she landed her triple axel, said rescue worker Ignativ Barkov, adding that Kostner ignored the sounds of cracking ice while performing an otherwise flawless step sequence and combination spin. We have to act fast or shell succumb to hypothermia. Granted, a world-class athlete like Kostner can withstand the initial shock for a few minutes, but her thin, sparkly leotard will do little to protect her from the deep and frigid water below the ice. At press time, crews were attempting another dive after initial efforts had only managed to recover a sequined headband and several loose rhinestones. ",0

"After the records of players who used performance-enhancing drugs are carefully removed, statistics provided by the Elias Sports Bureau indicate that lifetime .255 hitter Craig Counsell was the best player of the past 15 years. 'If you judge them on the basis of pure physical ability, you're left with Craig Counsell,' said ESB representative Patrick Wondolowski, adding that Counsell's 35 career home runs narrowly beat out Quinton McCracken's 21 and pitcher Glendon Rusch's three. Upon hearing the news, broadcaster Bob Uecker lauded the Brewers utilityman as 'one of the best I ever saw, if we're talking about those who I can say without a doubt never took steroids. He came this close to stealing a base off of Ivan Rodriguez, and I swear I heard him foul tip a Roger Clemens fastball. The kid could flat-out steroid-free play. One time he was playing third base and he caught a Rafael Palmeiro line drivejust caught it, right in his mitt.' When asked about his Hall of Fame chances, Counsell dodged the question by asking if anyone had a few bucks so he could go buy a sandwich. ",0
"Divide and Conquer by Domestic Terrorism: Progressives Take the BaitProgressives are generally empathetic to the suffering of others, which is their most admirable quality. Like all Americans, progressives should be saddened by the recent Batman shooting in Aurora and the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin. Comments like Enough is enough, its time to ban guns! echoed beneath countless articles and Facebook posts. Headlines like Right-wing extremist terrorism more dangerous than al Qaedawere featured on CNN. Theseare dead giveaways to how the agenda is playing out. These tragic events, whether genuine or staged, are clearly being usedto drum up support for more gun control and domestic surveillance of Americans. Progressives seem blinded by their sympathy for the innocent victims to see that they are being played against their fellow Americans, and they are literally begging for their rights to be removed. Well, not their rights, just the rights of potentially dangerous extremists which all of their think tank literature tells them are liberty lovers, defenders of the Constitution, returning veterans, gun owners, and so on. Since average progressives dont fall into these categories, they seem happy to call for the destruction of their rights in the land of the free. Much like most Americans went along with the USA PATRIOT Act after 9/11 because they were told only foreign Muslims would be spied on and indefinitely detained without charges. Only after the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) did Americans realize that these tactics were actually intended for domestic civilians. After numerous thwarted lone wolf terrorist plots were proven to be FBI patsies and the Fast and Furious government gun-running scandal was proven to be staged to attack gun rights, whoever is coordinating these sinister plots needed real blood to move their agenda forward. To non-partisans who have been paying close attention to these events, this has become all too obvious. It has led to an immediate belief that these recent lone wolf shootings were in fact staged, of which there is plenty of evidence to suggest this is true. But none more so than what these events are being used for politically. It has led to dangerous group think that allows otherwise decent people to not only accept but to demand previously unthinkable punishments like torture and outright murder. Is it fair to broad brush conservatives as dangerous extremists because of these events? Shall we consider all progressives to be dangerous because a progressive president drone bombs innocent civilians in sovereign nations and assassinates American citizens without due process? Empathy is one of the most commendable traits a person can have. But a truly empathetic person understands that what you do to others is what youre doing to yourself. In other words, when you demand that people with a different ideology be treated differently then yourself, you arent empathetic, youre vengeful. And, ultimately, what you wish to happen to them is exactly what youll get in return. Because you were okay with indefinitely detaining insurgents without Habeas Corpus, you got it too. Because youre okay with wiretapping international communications to fight terror, you got it too. Because youre okay with drones killing by remote control, you got it too. Because youre okay with preemptive undeclared war, you got it too. Because youre okay with stopping illegalimmigrationwith warrantless checkpoints, show us your papers please. Since you think entire groups are to blame for isolated events, you now have the TSA groping or radiating your children. And on and on. This will continue until both sides of the false political spectrum realize they are being played against each other by a ruthless force that does not care about any ideology except more power and control. They know exactly which emotional buttons to push to get you to relinquish more control to them. In fact, if youre scared or angry enough, youll beg for it like youre doing now for more gun control and more surveillance of your fellow Americans. Be careful what you wish for, youll likely get it.

"On Wednesday, hundreds gathered in front of the Johannesburg high court to mark the death of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo, the feminist Aids activist who accused Jacob Zuma of rape. The tribute was organised by the One in Nine campaign, a group of feminist activists formed a decade earlier to provide solidarity as Kuzwayo testified against Zuma â€“ a family friend and prominent member of the ruling African National Congress â€“ inside the selfsame court. Although the media disclosed Kuzwayoâ€™s real name at the time of the trial, activists chose to defend her right to privacy with the pseudonym â€œKhweziâ€. The court proceedings were short and brutal, exposing her sexual history and questioning her sexuality. Zuma admitted to intercourse but denied rape, explaining that he had unprotected sex despite knowing Kuzwayo was HIV-positive, but took a shower afterwards to prevent infection.   Related: 'Khwezi', the woman who accused Jacob Zuma of rape, dies   Zuma argued that Kuzwayo had invited his sexual advances by wearing a kanga (a printed cotton wrap commonly worn by African women at home), and did not resist as he woke and penetrated her. His testimony nullified the notion of active consent â€“ of a woman verbally and clearly acceding to a sexual encounter. Zuma was acquitted, while the presiding judge, Willem van der Merwe, questioned Kuzwayoâ€™s past history of sexual assault. One could argue that the proceedings were unremarkable. Rates of violence against women globally are at epidemic proportions: an estimated one in three women will be violated in her lifetime. Zuma is by no means the only elected official who has faced allegations of rape or sexual harassment. Nor is he the only political figure who has laughed at the notion of a womanâ€™s right to consent. Rape is, as the South African feminist academic Pumla Dineo Gqola has said, â€œa crime of powerâ€. What remains compelling in this story, however, is the example of Kuzwayo herself, and the people who came out publicly to support her as she stood up to the might of institutionalised patriarchy, and old political allegiances. The One in Nine campaign â€“ composed of seasoned activists and people from the feminist, queer and HIV and Aids movements â€“ represented the constituencies from which she came. Vastly outnumbered by Zumaâ€™s supporters, they refused to leave the streets in front of the court despite verbal abuse from the crowds and harassment by police.  The protests were supported by a handful of public figures such as Pregs Govender, the former ANC MP. Feminists from the broader African region also expressed their outrage at what they saw as the â€œhorrific and unethical victimisationâ€ of Kuzwayo.    In Africa and beyond, the world has often acted shamefully in the face of rape   Even in death, Kuzwayoâ€™s example is imbued with a power impossible to ignore. The ANC Womenâ€™s League, which had vociferously defended Zuma during the rape trial, greeted her demise with an offer of routine condolences. The organisationâ€™s secretary general made a sheepish nod to an apology, observing in an interview that Kuzwayo had been â€œbrave and fearlessâ€ for coming forward with the accusation. Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute. Most cases occur with only the accused and the survivor present, and forensic evidence is often minimal. Feminists recognise how common rape is, and how often violators get away with it. They use three simple words: â€œWe believe youâ€ â€“ because to believe a woman, publicly, is to stand up to male social dominance.  In Africa and beyond, the world has often acted shamefully in the face of rape. Consider how few resources are available to support work to end violence against women. Consider how many womenâ€™s organisations remain underfunded, and consequently limited in their capacity to cope with the scale of violation. And look at how one-stop centres established in collaboration with state police tend to falter once those who spearheaded their creation â€“ usually women â€“ move on. We can no longer blame practical inaction on the apparent intractability of the problem. Preventing violence against women is possible. Indeed, research carried out in 2014 in Ugandaâ€™s capital, Kampala, offered proof that changing the way we think about and manage gendered power in society can lead to reduced violence, changed attitudes and increased solidarity with women. These positive shifts will only happen if we stop relying on a handful of the â€œbraveâ€ to act as a frontline. We, citizens and the state, need to redistribute this onus, and start taking seriously our collective responsibility to change the power dynamics that make rape possible.  â€¢ Jessica Horn is a feminist activist and director of programmes at the African Womenâ€™s Development Fund.

"As susceptible as anyone else is to the charms of Ed Balls, I nevertheless had an eerie feeling watching Strictly Come Dancing. In the 90s, we used to talk a lot about the primacy of the retro, whether or not constantly referring back to the past meant that our innovative spirit was spent. But the reference was always knowing, and partial; you wouldnâ€™t hark back to the 1960s without putting a fresh spin on it. You wouldnâ€™t create a TV show that could literally have been made in the 1960s.   Related: Nostalgic for the 50s? Let me give you a history lesson | Catherine Bennett   Yet thatâ€™s exactly what Strictly is; a glitzy, feelgood experience that you can put a nine-year-old in front of, knowing that it is indistinguishable in atmosphere from a Royal Variety show from when you were nine, or when your mother was. The breathless banality, the fist-bumping attainments: â€œI never dreamed that five weeks ago, Iâ€™d be able to dance a paso doble.â€ The whole nation roots for them, heart-in-mouth, as it did for Bake Off. What kind of a monster wouldnâ€™t? What kind of a person would want some edge, some cynicism, on a Saturday night? And then on a Sunday, who wouldnâ€™t want Andrew Marr to be talking to REM? Whose heart would be so hard as to think it a shame that we are still talking about a band formed 36 years ago, that pop music should be a young personâ€™s game? The passion for an idealised past is very reassuring, culturally; the worst you can throw at it is blandness. Creativity isnâ€™t always successful â€“ if you put a joke that doesnâ€™t work against a piece of nostalgia that does, there is no doubting which is the most affecting. Emotional spaces carved out in childhood exist for ever, and there will always be comfort in their inhabitation. The only reason I was watching Strictly in the first place was that Iâ€™d just suffered the anguish of finishing The Chrysalids for the 37th time. I just wanted to dial that down to â€œ17thâ€ to be believed. Itâ€™s weird there isnâ€™t a word for â€œdo the opposite of exaggerate, for the sake of credibilityâ€. Politically, nostalgia is poison. Nostalgia is Nigel Farage, on Any Questions?, saying the demise of grammar schools was the worst thing that ever happened to social mobility in this country, which is indivisible from the same man, on the same programme, promising civil unrest if we didnâ€™t leave the single market. Nostalgia is Jonathan Dimbleby failing to point out that five months ago, before the referendum, Farage wanted to remain in the single market. The paradox of nostalgia is that it has a terrible memory â€“ or rather, like senility, it has a terrible short-term memory and very vivid, utterly inaccurate, recall for the long-ago. Nostalgia is blaming everything on immigrants and multiculturalism, since purity and the past are similar destinations, similarly meaningless, similarly unreachable.    Belt-tightening, like picnicking in the rain, isnâ€™t necessarily a good thing. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images   Ideologically, nostalgia is a retreat from a frightening future. You can see this most clearly in the way people talk about the economy: from the left and right, there is a sense that the past is a foreign country where they do things not so much differently as better. The past is always Denmark. On the right, itâ€™s a place where workers knew their place; on the left, itâ€™s where workers knew how to organise. Itâ€™s where we hadnâ€™t forgotten the principle of a decent dayâ€™s pay for a decent dayâ€™s work. On the right, itâ€™s where we still had an empire; on the left, itâ€™s where we were still proud people who made things. It is the crucible not only of every nativist myth, but of all that passes for an understanding of what the economy is for: people will opine quite confidently about the economic verities of the 1970s, while accepting that modern problems â€“ to pluck one wild example, the possible consequences of leaving the single market â€“ are so complicated that to discuss them at all is fear-mongering. The past is the reason â€œausterityâ€ took off, and stayed aloft, even while its destructive contradictions became plain. There was a time when we knew how to tighten our belts; ergo, belt-tightening will be good for us, uncomfortable but quite jolly and English, like picnicking in the rain. Political nostalgia leaves you with a burning, indignant desire for a thing you canâ€™t have. Cultural nostalgia doesnâ€™t seem to unleash such self-harming effects, but merely acts as fuel. Recycling old formats reinforces the comfort-seeking brain that cannot brook challenge and simply refuses to be exhilarated by novelty. Bake Off, incidentally, is morally worse than Strictly; as saccharine, as old-fashioned, perhaps, but mixing in the disproportionate glorification of a timeless craft that, however dauntingly complicated it becomes, will never deliver anything but simplicity. The familiar debate around public service broadcasting is whether or not it has a duty to be highbrow, given that there is no requirement to please advertisers: whether and to what extent it has to fulfil the Reithian principle of educating as well as entertaining. In fact, a far more important duty is that it innovates, and reflects a society back to itself, one in which things change, and that need not be a disaster. It might even be a good thing. So itâ€™s an imperative of good citizenship to stop watching Strictly, or if thatâ€™s too much, stop voting, or if thatâ€™s too much, at least stop voting for Ed Balls. It probably seems to REM like their country has never needed them more, but in fact, their country needs them to knock it off. Stop watching Star Wars, stop making Jurassic World, stop rehashing old memories and maybe the potent spells of Self-Ruling Britannia and Making America Great Again will wear off. (PS â€¦ except Doctor Who. Regeneration is very modern.)",1
"Could This be the First News Channel Run by Teens?Politics affects everyone, so everyone deserves a voice; especially the youth It seems like everywhere I go online, I am met with the diligence of Andrew Demeter. I wrote about his award-winning mini-documentary We The People, Genetically Modified. Expertly produced, it encompassed a lot of information for a short video and was the perfect crash course to share the issue with friends. And yes, Andrew Demeter is the one who confronted Nancy Pelosi on the NSA. He talks about it afterward, here. When he is not busy developing independent journalism out of Cleveland, OH, he is running his YouTube channel, TeenTake. Or accepting scholarships for the Mises Institute or reading invitations to give a TED Talk. Now he is asking for support to produce the very first news channel run entirely by teens, called Politicast. Oh yeah, and hes only 16 As Demeter, says of his upcoming teen-run station, it would highlight reporters, not repeaters. Given his diligence and background, hes got what it takes to produce news and bring other teens on board. Now he would like to step it up with a news studio, and anyone who is interested can help him with his IndieGoGo fundraiser. Demeter writes: As always with fundraisers like this, you can receive fun prizes in return for a donation. Four people have claimed the gift of receiving a two-minute rant from Demeter on any subject they choose. It comes with the previous gifts attached to lower-amount donations.

"HUDSON, N.Y. â€” Zak Pelaccio, the chef associated for years with the flavors of Malaysia at Fatty Crab, is returning to the food of Southeast Asia.Mr. Pelaccio became known for cooking Southeast Asian food in downtown Manhattan in the early 2000s. But in 2011, he parted ways with the company behind Fatty Crab and its sibling restaurants and transplanted himself to this artistsâ€™ magnet in the Hudson Valley to open Fish & Game, a high-end tavern where his vigorously local work won a James Beard Award in May.He seemed to have moved away from the Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese accents that had once put him in the spotlight. â€œI always liked cooking that food,â€ he said. â€œBut I thought it would be in poor taste for me to depart from the organization and then open up a shop that was somewhat similar.â€Now some time has passed. On Hudsonâ€™s main drag, Warren Street, Mr. Pelaccio and his partners recently took over BackBar, an open-air cocktail spot squeezed between an antique shop and a patio full of picnic tables.At BackBar this month, Mr. Pelaccio and his co-chef at Fish & Game, Kevin Pomplun, plan to introduce a lunch and dinner menu they are calling Bakar at BackBar. Bakar is a reference to â€œikan bakarâ€ roadside spots throughout Malaysia where people can snack on grilled fish.On the lineup are dishes like a spicy laab salad made with pork shoulder, a curried crab and fish chowder, asparagus folded into an omelet with homemade XO sauce and a sesame panna cotta made with palm sugar from Borneo. (Mr. Pelaccioâ€™s wife, the chef and fermentation specialist Jori Jayne Emde, is responsible for many of the from-scratch condiments like fish sauce, red chile sauce, vinegar and sambal that bring an extra punch of heat and funk to the dishes.)Mr. Pelaccio hopes to debut the new menu about June 21. He said he expects the restaurant to seat 76.Change is also afoot at Fish & Game, where Mr. Pelaccio and Mr. Pomplun recently introduced a rustic Ã  la carte menu that might feature (depending on the day) spit-roasted duck, beans cooked in a fireplace and a dry-aged rib-eye steak with bÃ©arnaise sauce. A meal at Fish & Game is expensive, but the chefs want Bakar at BackBar to be the opposite â€” nothing on the menu will cost more than $20.â€œThis is for locals,â€ Mr. Pelaccio said. â€œWe need a place where people can come and eat lunch for a reasonable price. This has a vibe where itâ€™s sort of easy. Itâ€™s not so buttoned up. This could be by the beach.â€",1

"Global Recession? The Canadian Economy Shrinks At The Fastest Pace Since The Last Financial CrisisBy Michael Snyder The recent drop in GDP was larger than analysts had projected, but not far off the predicted 1.5% loss. [The figure] could have been worse, given the hit from the wildfire, and clearly confirms the disappointing downward trend in exports over the last few months, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. In May, wildfires devastated the parts of northern Alberta where much of Canadas oil and natural gas is produced. For many years, high oil prices and booming exports enabled the Canadian economy to significantly outperform the U.S. economy. But now conditions have changed dramatically, and all of the economic bubbles up in Canada are starting to burst. This includes the housing bubble, as we have seen home sales in the hottest markets such as Vancouver drop through the floor late in the summer. In fact, it is being reported that home sales during the first two weeks of August in British Columbia were down a whopping51 percent on a year-over-year basis. Do you remember the housing bubble in the U.S. that helped fuel the last financial crisis? Well, a very similar bubble is now bursting up in Canada, and some investors have positioned themselves to make a tremendous amount of money when the whole thing comes violently crashing down. The following comesfrom Wolf Richter I think its a money laundering-induced market, he said as we reported at the time. Where the local politicians, or the BC Liberals, are kept or in cahoots with the real estate brokers, developers, lawyers, that angle. And they have sought Chinese money to keep the market propped up and it wont last, he said. China has capital controls on, and Vancouver has become the money laundering mecca of either the world or North America, and something is going to change and change drastically. If the price of oil does not rebound in a major way, the Canadian economy is going to continue to deeply struggle. Meanwhile, one of the biggest economies in Africa is also shrinking. Nigeria is yet another oil-dependent economy that has fallen on really hard times, and during the latest quarter their GDP shrunkby 2.06 percent on an annualized basis Nigeria has slipped into recession, with the latest growth figures showing the economy contracted 2.06% between April and June. The country has now seen two consecutive quarters of declining growth, the usual definition of recession. Its vital oil industry has been hit by weaker global prices, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). There are so many signs that indicate that the global economy has entered a new major downturn. Yes, the U.S. is doing better than almost everyone else for the moment, but this will not last indefinitely. Our planet is more interconnected than ever before, and just as we saw in 2008, big trouble on one side of the globe quickly affects the other side. Today we also learned that the 7th largest container shipping company in the entire worldhas completely imploded. Total global trade has been declining for quite some time now, and it was inevitable that this sort of thing would start happening After years of relentless decline in the Baltic Dry index today the largest casualty finally emerged on Wednesday when South Koreas Hanjin Shipping, the countrys largest shipping firm and the worlds seventh-biggest container carrier, filed for court receivership after losing the support of its banks, leaving its assets frozen as ports from China to Spain denied access to its vessels. Over in Europe, an emerging banking crisis continues to simmer just under the surface. Most Americans are completely oblivious to the fact that major global financial problems could be just around the corner, butCNBC is reporting that banks over in Europe are preparing for an economic nuclear winter situation European banks, in particular, have had a very tough six months as the shock and volatility around Brexit sent banking stocks south. Major European banks like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse saw their shares in free-fall after the referendums results were announced. In the U.K., RBS was the worst-hit, with its shares plunging by more than 30 percent since June 24. The current uncertainty over when the U.K. will start the process of quitting the EU has banks on tenterhooks. But a source told CNBC that banks are preparing for an economic nuclear winter situation. Speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic, a source from a major investment bank told CNBC that financial services firms have put together a strategy in place that takes into account the worst-case scenario that could happen by the end of this year. So precisely what would an economic nuclear winter look like? I dont know, but it certainly does not sound good. We should be thankful that things have been as calm and stable as they have been so far in 2016, but nobody should be fooled into thinking that our problems have been fixed. The truth is that the global debt bubble is at an all-time high, the banks are being more reckless and are more vulnerable than ever before, and troubling economic numbers continue to pour in from all over the planet. The stage is certainly set for the next major global economic crisis, and it isnt going to take much to push the world over the edge.

"Rileyâ€™s Fish Shack, King Edwardâ€™s Bay, Tynemouth. Meal for two including drinks and service: Â£45. No bookings Call off the search. Close down the web browser and put away the guide books. I have found the eating experience of the year. Itâ€™s the sort of place that people mumble irritatingly about to each other, in a way that makes it sound like some tiresome gastronomic Shangri-La; honey-toned and utterly unobtainable. We roll our eyes at such stories. We assume that the experience is better in the retelling than in the reality, its virtues amplified by the efforts some might have to make to get there. Lunch always tastes better when it comes glazed with struggle. To be fair some of this may apply to Rileyâ€™s Fish Shack. Itâ€™s on the beach at King Edwardâ€™s Bay, half an hourâ€™s drive from Newcastle. It really is hidden. The sat nav took me to a shopping street in Tynemouth. We parked up and wandered to the front. There, we looked down over the Edwardian railings and the vertiginous shoreline to the shack. We knew it was the place. There was a film-fun-style cartoon of a fish skeleton on the roof, the motif repeated across all the deckchairs out front. A wisp of smoke pirouetted from its Hobbit chimney on the roof. We started our descent. The shack belongs to Adam Riley, who did some of his training on the Isle of Man, before moving to the north east to work with his fatherâ€™s theatre company. He shifted sideways into street food, and for two years ran a mobile fish cart on the beach.   This is a Boden photoshoot brought to life. It is every boho, middle-class food fantasy made real. And itâ€™s fantastic   The knackered cart is still parked up on the sand in front of the â€œshackâ€, in truth two full side-access shipping containers, those sides opened out to form the balcony floor. Itâ€™s then been fitted out steampunk-style in a mixture of dark wood and artfully rusted steel. The balcony out front has a narrow counter so you can sit on hardwood stools and look out over the beach, under cover of yellow tarpaulins. Industrial-scale trawlers bob and turn far out on the bay, the result of a shipping bankruptcy a few months back. Alternatively, if the weather is keeping to type, thereâ€™s some basic seating inside, behind sliding glass doors. They need them. This being the north east, Rileyâ€™s donâ€™t do anything as feeble as seasonal opening. The shack is open all year round. If you want to fit in, wear a T-shirt in December. Most of the inside space, however, is taken up by a wood-fired oven, squatting like a giant red-backed ladybird, its flame-filled mouth open to the door, plus a long grill. The menu is short and based around a handful of virtues. They have that oven. They have fish. They have crisp-roasted garlicky potatoes. They have a killer bread recipe, for use as flatbreads and for casings of what they call empanadas, but you can call pasties. They have crunchy salads. Adam has a beard and a woolly cap. All of these things are essential. The food is served in thin wooden boxes, with wooden disposable knives and forks. It is messy. It is so, so good.    â€˜Still smoking delicately in the boxâ€™: mackerel. Photograph: Alex Telfer for the Observer   Two fat fillets of fresh mackerel, seared on the grill until the skin is blackened and bubbled, come on piles of those dark, crisped potatoes, with both a fennel and a green salad and a freshly made, lightly charred flatbread, still smoking delicately in the box. There is a spiced tomato relish, and a bolshie smear of salsa verde to lend the necessary high acidic notes. Tear off a piece of bread, break up the fish and shove one inside the other. It costs Â£7.50. At twice the price there are fillets of plaice, so white and virginal the Vatican would probably write them a glowing letter of recommendation. They are cooked en papillote in the oven, with squared-off boiled potatoes, nutty-brown shrimps, samphire and mussels still in the shell, so that they produces their own limpid broth. It is the pristine quality of fish cookery you always hope to find in one of those fancy, raised pinkie finger London places, but rarely do.    â€˜Big bready triangles so chunky you could sleep on themâ€™: empanadas. Photograph: Alex Telfer for the Observer   Skewers of squid, big ones with thick tentacles that once put work in, have been shown the grill just long enough to char without allowing them to seize up. Then there are the empanadas, big bready triangles so chunky you could sleep on them if you were short of bedding. One hides a mess of long-stewed beef and oysters, cooked down to a tangle of animal with the sweet, happy funk of the bivalve. The other is spiced salmon, like the best Thai fish cake, breathing hot aromatics over you with each bite. Yours for Â£4 each, Â£10 for three. There is a short wine list priced between Â£16.50 and Â£25, and a bit of craft beer. Music, involving double basses, heartache and vocals sung by men with names like Brad or Thorsten, roars across the beach as if calling to the abandoned trawlers out on the North Sea. We sit at the outside counter, scarved and coated against the early autumn bluster, fork away boxes of terrific fish cookery and watch children in wellies running between the deckchairs on the beach, artfully placed around fire pits.    â€˜Thick tentacles that once put work inâ€™: chargrilled squid. Photograph: Alex Telfer for the Observer   Quickly it strikes us: this is a Boden catalogue photoshoot, brought to life. It is every boho, middle-class food fantasy made real. And you know what: itâ€™s bloody fantastic. The food is a minor miracle given the circumstances, the price achingly reasonable, and the setting utterly perfect. Oh, my dear, sweet darlings, I think Iâ€™m in love. There are some pre-packaged brownies available on the bar, and coffee, but to secure them you will have to join the queue again, and as the afternoon or evening draws on that can become lengthy. My advice is to work off some of those roasties by climbing back up the cliff to the high street. A little way down on a corner, you will find Gareth James Chocolatier. The coffee is good and they supply the brownies sold at Rileyâ€™s. The salted caramel version is thick and fudgy. Better still, get a few of their domed salted caramel chocolates which are as good as any Iâ€™ve tried anywhere. The tempered chocolate shell is crisp; the liquid centre is that perfect balance of sweet to salt. And suddenly, like those chocolates, Iâ€™m gushing all over again. But thatâ€™s the way it is. For a few glorious hours on a Sunday afternoon, Tynemouth is the very pin-prick centre of my culinary universe. Jayâ€™s news bites â–  The equivalent of Rileyâ€™s Fish Shack at Oban is even more basic. The Oban Seafood Hut, on the quay where the CalMac ferries to the islands depart, has only outside tables. The freshest seafood emerges on paper plates: huge scallops and langoustine are served in puddles of garlicky butter. There are crab sandwiches as thick as a Hilary Mantel novel and the most you can spend is Â£25 on a seafood platter, with lobster. â–  Until the end of next week, Fernando Stovell, chef at Stovellâ€™s in Chobham, Surrey will be drawing on the Mexico of his birth to serve a seven-course Day of the Dead tasting menu, yours for Â£78 a head. It includes fish grilled over citrus wood and served with guajillo and ancho chilli.  â–  For those who fear Brexit means an end to culinary internationalism, some good news: MamuÅ›ka!, the Polish restaurant at Londonâ€™s Elephant and Castle, is looking to build on Britainâ€™s sizable Polish community with five more branches within the M25, and in Manchester, Liverpool or Bristol.

"Harry Reid Calls Bundy Supporters Domestic TerroristsPaul Lawrance So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are notthey are nothing more than domestic terrorists, said Reid. I repeat: what happened there was domestic terrorism. Reid was referring to the standoff in Bunkerville last week where Bundy supporters, some of whom were wielding firearms, managed to get Bureau of Land Management agents to back down and release the 380 cattle they had corralled. They had sniper rifles in the freeway. They had weapons, automatic weapons, Reid went on. They had children and women lined up because if anyone got hurt we wanted to make sure they got hurt first. Ealier in the week Reid publicly stated that the the BLMs fight with Bundy was not over. Well, its not over, Reid told NBCs Nevada affiliate KRNV. We cant have an American people that violate the law and then just walk away from it. So its not over. Reid echoed a similar statement during his speaking time at the Las Vegas event on Thursday. Is it possible that Reid is just upset that the BLM had to stand down when he was reportedly the one behind the crackdown and has ties to solar farms not to far from the Bundy Ranch? No matter where you sit on the Bundy issue, it should upset you that such an influential person in the Congress would label Americans as terrorists. Especially in a time where dangerous legislation like the NDAA exists. Paul Lawrance writes for Eyes Open Report where this first appeared. ",0
"Michelle Obama Was Just Caught On Video Doing Something Truly Sickening [VIDEO] You would think that with all the threats that America is facing, Michelle Obama might finally give up her ridiculous projects and focus on the true issues impacting our country. Instead, Michelle jumped at the opportunity this week to host her last garden-planting event at the White House. During her appearance, Michelle complained about how emotional the experience was for her. Its interesting that she shows more compassion for a garden than she does about say, our men and women in uniform or taxpayer dollars. It was eight years ago that we cooked up this really interesting idea that maybe we could dig up some dirt on the South Lawnmaybe somebody would let us do that, and we would plant a wonderful garden that would be a space for us to talk about the food we eat, Michelle commented. This is my baby, she continued. And hopefully, this will not be the last planting. Hopefully, there will be other administrations who come in and they take up this project and continue to make this a part of the White House tradition. On second thought, we cant blame Michelle for getting emotional. This is probably the most positive thing she ever did in the White House. Still, you wont see us patting her on the back anytime soon.

"Women will have shouldered 85% of the burden of the governmentâ€™s changes to the tax and benefits system by 2020, according to figures published ahead of next weekâ€™s autumn statement. The analysis, by independent thinktank the Womenâ€™s Budget Group, shows that tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have hit womenâ€™s incomes twice as hard as men by 2020. Women will be Â£1,003 a year worse off by 2020 on average; for men, this figure is Â£555. Less affluent women will be the worst affected: those with below-average incomes will find themselves Â£1,678 worse off. Many belong to the â€œjust managingâ€ families â€“ those getting by on less than average earnings â€“ that Theresa May has pledged will be a key priority for the government.   Related: Equal Pay Day: how the UK's gender gap in earnings has shifted over the years   The Womenâ€™s Budget Groupâ€™s forecasts assume that the government proceeds with all of its planned changes to tax and benefits in the runup to 2020, including the roll-out of universal credit. They also take into account increases in the â€œnational living wageâ€, set to rise to Â£9 an hour by 2020. Eva Neitzert, the groupâ€™s director, said: â€œWomen, especially those on low incomes, have shouldered the largest burden of austerity measures. Overall, women stand to lose twice as much as men by 2020, and for those on the lowest incomes this means a cut of between 11 and 15%.â€ In her first speech as prime minister, May committed her government to fighting against â€œburning injusticeâ€, including addressing the gender pay gap. As home secretary, she won plaudits for her work to tackle gender issues such as domestic violence, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. But the latest analysis shows how far measures introduced since 2010 by the former chancellor George Osborne have increased gender inequality. In particular, universal credit, a new benefit that merges several benefits and tax credits and will be phased in over the next few years, will be paid by default into the account of the main earner in each household â€“ unlike the benefits it replaces. Womenâ€™s groups have argued this will undermine womenâ€™s economic independence. â€œThe prime minister deserves credit for her work as home secretary in tackling some gender issues such as violence against women,â€ said Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the Womenâ€™s Resource Centre, an umbrella body for womenâ€™s charities. â€œBut these figures that reveal women are bearing over 80% of the burden of cuts to tax credits and benefits highlight that she will need to raise her game in No 10 if women are to really believe she cares about tackling womenâ€™s inequality.â€ Lone parents â€“ 90% of whom are single mothers â€“ will be particularly affected. Some working single parents will lose up to a monthâ€™s income as a result of cuts arising from universal credit, says the charity Gingerbread. Tracey is a single parent in her late 30s, unable to work because of disability. Over the past six years she has experienced cuts to disability benefits, housing benefit and council tax benefit that have left her struggling with living costs. â€œIâ€™ve cut everything back as much as I can. I donâ€™t smoke, I donâ€™t drink, I donâ€™t go out any more,â€ she said. â€œI often have to put off paying one bill in order to keep the heating on. I sometimes end up needing to borrow from friends without knowing when I can pay them back, which I hate doing.â€ The government has claimed the national living wage, introduced in April this year, will provide a boost to lower-earning families. But for many families any positive impact has been more than outweighed by cuts to tax credits. â€œThe introduction of the national living wage has been a good thing for women, who make up 60% of the low-paid workforce,â€ said David Finch, senior economic analyst at thinktank the Resolution Foundation. â€œBut the good news on pay simply cannot compensate for such large welfare cuts, especially among women who are disproportionally worse off.â€ The new figures come in the wake of a report on Friday from the women and equalities select committee that called for an independent inquiry into why the government has not published a proper analysis of how its spending plans will affect women, minorities and disabled people. â€œThis begs an obvious question: are Treasury ministers deliberately seeking to hide inconvenient truths about the impact of its policies on women?â€ said Neitzert. â€œThe Treasury has a legal obligation to have due regard for the impact of its policies on equality but doesnâ€™t seem keen to do this in any meaningful way.â€",1
"In the wake of the second blizzard of 2010, blowing and drifting snow from gusty winds will continue to block some roads and city streets in the Northeast on Thursday. The added weight of snow will also lead to additional roof collapses in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington. Lake-effect snow will continue to produce heavy amounts downwind of the Great Lakes. Low temperatures will greatly limit melting in the wake of the recent storm from the Midwest to the Atlantic Coast. Sunshine will prevail over the southern Atlantic seaboard. But clouds are already increasing over the lower Mississippi Valley. A storm moving toward the Gulf Coast from Mexico is already bringing rain to much of Texas. Snow from the storm will fall from North Texas to the interior Deep South into the end of the week. The roots of yet another snowstorm for part of the Northeast will produce flurries in the Dakotas. This fast-moving low pressure may join with a similar storm farther north to spread snow through the Midwest on Sunday and the Northeast on Monday. In the Northwest, rain and snow will prevail. FOCUS: SNOWSTORM OF FEBRUARY 1969 On Feb. 9, 1969, a powerful storm along the Eastern seaboard brought in about one to two feet of snow from New Jersey to New England. Winds of up to 65 mph whipped the snow into huge drifts. The storm immobilized the entire region. ",1
"Texans Makes HUGE Stand Against Muslims After They Try To Invade Their Town According to recent reports, a number of Texans have decided to organize a civil revolt against the influence of Shariah law in their state and in the country. The uprising comes as a result of announcements that a Muslim Tribunal court was forming in Irving, TX. Tension has been rising in Texas for quite some time now, and the local Muslim community and government officials have been at odds. Now, that tension has reached its peak, after city government officials recent approved a bill addressing the influence of the mediation panel. Recent events have events have put me under attack and I need your help now! the mayor of Irving, Beth Van Duyne asked of the community after passing the bill. Stand with me to help me fight for conservative values and the Constitution. Van Duyne claims that she has been receiving attacks from both the liberal media and the Islamic Center in Irving.

"Baby boomers. The luckiest generation ever to have lived. Bolstered by the postwar settlement, which favoured egalitarianism, we enjoyed the spoils of peace. Our ambitions were everyoneâ€™s ambitions. We saw that the daughter of a shopkeeper could go to Oxbridge, a wife and mother could enjoy a career, and a woman could rise to become prime minister, then set about dismantling the system that had brought her such benefit. Margaret Thatcher didnâ€™t much like baby boomers, even though she thrived in the atmosphere we created. Maybe she had a point. Baby boomers have proved to be not only lucky but also selfish. We have pulled up so many of the ladders we climbed.   Related: Donâ€™t blame globalisation for poverty | Liam Fox   A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has confirmed that people born in the early 1980s have half the wealth that people born in the 70s had accumulated by the same stage in their lives. No wonder. When Thatcher came to power in 1979, a process began that saw unemployment rise steeply, social housing stocks diminish rapidly, and schools and hospitals become deeply dysfunctional from lack of funds. A term was coined for those at the sharp end of all this. They were â€œthe underclassâ€, their problem being â€œsocial exclusionâ€. Which, in a capitalist society, is of course a politely victim-blaming way of describing economic exclusion. Economic exclusion hampers the ability to accumulate assets. Who would have thought it? Surprisingly few people, it seems. Lessons have not been learned â€“ not by the right people anyway. Austerity is the political process by which the most vulnerable suffer in order to protect the interests of the least vulnerable. The least vulnerable are, of course, the economically included. Since the early 80s, their own ability to accumulate assets has only been enhanced. The repairing and rebuilding of the schools and hospitals that had been run down as a consequence of swingeing cuts in public service funding? The economically included were invited to invest in such ventures, for a highly advantageous and guaranteed return. They are largely baby boomers, of course. The sick, disabled people, the disadvantaged â€“ they visit food banks so that the price of the 2008 intervention against the credit crunch can be paid. What chance do their children stand? Young people today have so much to fear. They pay high rents on low pay, even if they have a degree and the commensurate debt such self-improvement now entails. If wages are to be low, then infrastructure has to be supportive. Yet itâ€™s now almost impossible for a young person to snag an affordable home in a place where employment can also be had. Commuting isnâ€™t too great an option, since the cost of travel, and sometimes its unreliability, is so prohibitive. Being sensible, and setting aside money for a pension? Not when you already owe a fortune at 21.   Related: We millennials need to fight if weâ€™re not to be left behind | Abi Wilkinson   Many people now understand that Tony Blair blew his chance to put Britain on a better footing. He believed he could triangulate, giving the private sector its freedom, and using the cash that generated to tackle social exclusion. In my view Blair, having found the tackling of social exclusion to be more arduous and time-consuming than he imagined, decided that if he couldnâ€™t fix Britain, then maybe he could fix the world instead. I worry that the left simply rejects his mistakes, rather than learning from them. People forget how immovable the Thatcher/Major Conservative administration proved to be, even as the homeless teemed in the streets and young people left school to greet long-term unemployment. They believe that hating the establishment is all they need to do, failing to see that this only entrenches the psychopathic lack of empathy that is the hallmark of its worst and most ruthless denizens. Itâ€™s easy to be despondent, to look at the grip big, international business has on the nation and how itâ€™s configured, and despair. Itâ€™s even easier to point the finger at such businesses and hope that come the revolution theyâ€™ll get their comeuppance. Whatâ€™s hard, however, is persuading those who benefit that their flashy international economy is destroying its own lifeblood â€“ stable real economies in which people can live and thrive with some self-sufficiency, enjoying their life and work, feeling secure, nurturing their families. Blair knew that those who benefited from the status quo had to be involved in change before it could start to happen. He may have been naive in giving them too much of what they wanted. But still, he was right in principle, and the next person to try for such a level of cooperation has the last crash to exhibit as evidence of what happens when a powerful group presses its advantage too greatly. The Conservatives have proved unwilling to learn from their mistakes. At the moment, Labour is refusing to learn from its mistakes, the only difference being that its distance from them is too great, not too little. In the years it will take for Labour to realise this, another generation could be sacrificed. The baby boomer years are well and truly over.",1

"To the Editor:Re â€œThe Tobacco Ties That Bind,â€ by Peter B. Bach (Op-Ed, April 11):I canâ€™t begin to express my disappointment with the American Cancer Society because of its unforgivable relationship with Walgreens, which continues to sell tobacco products. As a former cancer patient, I wonder: Is it too much to ask that the â€œlargest cancer charityâ€ be independent of the single most egregious industry on our planet?Being in bed with the tobacco industry and the pharmacies that promote smoking is simply unethical and a slap in the face of every cancer survivor.MITCHELL BRODSKYPrinceton, N.J., April 11, 2014To the Editor:Peter B. Bach implies that by ending the sale of tobacco products, CVS pharmacies are some kind of moral actor while Walgreens remains a greedy business. Walgreensâ€™s funding of the American Cancer Society by extension also compromises the moral standing of the society. In truth, they are all businesses.CVS looks to improve its image and its bottom line. Both CVS and Walgreens sell all kinds of things, from empty-calorie sugary drinks and heart-attack food to dubious health aids; if their primary mission were really to improve peopleâ€™s health, they would close down their drive-through windows and stop all those idling car engines.As for the cancer society, its executives take home high six-figure salaries. Such groups spend vast sums on advertising, advocacy, lobbying and more fund-raising in the cycle that perpetuates their existence.Compared with all this self-righteous hypocrisy, the tobacco industry seems a lot more honest: It admits to being a business and doesnâ€™t pretend to sell anything other than a product that everyone knows is bad for him or her.DAVID ROMANOOzark, Mo., April 11, 2014",1
"They say that money canâ€™t buy happiness. But can it? Answer these questions and discover if your income and wellbeing are related. 1.

On average, how often each day do you experience feelings of happiness, enthusiasm or satisfaction? And how often do you notice feelings of anger, frustration, sadness and worry?  The higher the earnings category you fall into, the less often you are likely to experience negative emotions. However, perhaps surprisingly, the earnings category makes no difference to how often you are likely to experience positive emotions. Studies conducted in the USA and Germany found that the higher your salary, the less often â€“ on average â€“ you experience feelings of anger, frustration, sadness and worry. But, significantly, there was no relationship at all between salary and how often people experienced happiness, enthusiasm or satisfaction. This makes sense: rich people donâ€™t walk around with a permanent grin on their faces, but they donâ€™t have to worry about where their next meal or rent payment is coming from. So the old saying is right after all: money canâ€™t buy happiness. But what it can buy â€“ and frequently does â€“ is the absence of sadness.

"The Republic of Irelandâ€™s chances of qualifying for Russia in 2018 are looking rosier after they overcame a mid-match wobble in Moldova to record an eventually comfortable victory, thanks to James McCleanâ€™s two second-half goals. It was a win that Martin Oâ€™Neillâ€™s side always deserved, and Irish spirits will have been further boosted by Wales dropping points at home to Georgia earlier in the evening, which leaves the Republic second in Group D. However, the manner in which they lost their way and conceded a sloppy equaliser shortly before half-time will concern the Republicâ€™s manager. Their captain, SÃ©amus Coleman, admitted as much. â€œJust before half-time we were very naive to be left isolated at the back like we were,â€ said the defender. â€œWe should have just come in at half-time one nil up, but we didnâ€™t and we made it hard work, and I thought we were very sloppy at times with flicks and kicks in the first half but we got it right in the second half.â€ Ireland were without the suspended Jeff Hendrick and the injured Robbie Brady but gave Wes Hoolahan a start and the Norwich playmaker proved his worth by setting up the opening goal after four minutes. He released Shane Long with a superb first-time pass from just past the halfway line for the Southampton striker to tuck it confidently away with his right foot, low into the corner past the advancing goalkeeper, Nicolae Calancea, for his first goal in 18 matches. They may not have been up against testing opposition but there was a fluency to Irelandâ€™s football that was largely absent three days earlier against Georgia. Hoolahan, always on the lookout for an incisive pass, was prominent in most Irish attacks, while Coleman on the right and McClean and Stephen Ward on the left frequently stretched the home defence. Ireland had chances to extend their lead when McClean fired wide first-time on the half-volley and when Coleman advanced skilfully to the byline and crossed for Long six yards out but his header was blocked by Vitalie Bordian. Moldova looked stretched, already reliant on the counterattack and balls forward for their wide men to chase, but the sole striker Igor Bugaev cut a lonely figure. The Moldova right-back, Igor Arnas, needed treatment to his right leg after a 50-50 challenge with Long and was carried off and replaced by Victor Golovatenco. Chances began to dry up, as Moldova ended the half with their best spell of the match. The visitors were punished just before half-time when Bugaev got goalside of the Irish back four on a breakaway, racing clear of the badly out of position Shane Duffy from halfway and finishing smartly past Darren Randolph from just inside the area. Moldova looked sprightly at the start of the second half, too, Alexandru Dedov testing Randolph with a firm rising drive. Oâ€™Neillâ€™s side now found themselves struggling to find the space and movement they had enjoyed in the opening stages, with passes going astray and Coleman receiving a yellow card for a foul on Dedov after being dispossessed. But the longer the half progressed, the more Moldova sat back and they were punished on 69 minutes when a hopeful shot from James McCarthy was controlled on the six-yard line by Jon Walters, who laid it back for McClean to send a firm shot low to the keeperâ€™s left-hand corner. McClean made sure seven minutes later, finishing a stylish move started by Hoolahan, whose close control on the right touchline created space for a pass to Coleman whose first-time delivery was volleyed in from close range. Moldovaâ€™s discipline began to desert them, Andrei Cojacari going in the book for an ugly hack at McClean. Tempers also boiled over in the final minute when Walters reacted badly to a foul from Dedov and earned a booking for dissent, after Oâ€™Neill had rushed on to the pitch to calm the winger down. But it was only a minor blemish on a satisfying evening.",1
"In a unanimous decision handed down on Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was sleazy enough to be included on Chicago's mayoral ballot. 'It is the opinion of this court that Mr. Emanuel is coarse, vulgar, and power-hungry to such a degree that he should be eligible to hold this city's highest office,' Illinois Justice Robert R. Thomas wrote in his majority opinion, adding that Emanuel also met a key stipulation requiring that any mayor of Chicago be a bully willing to do whatever is necessary to push his agenda through the city council. 'Further, Mr. Emanuel is a sleazebag and a sleazeball, both of which are criteria he fulfilled prior to filing his papers with the local election board.' The decision overturned an appellate court's ruling that Emanuel was only sleazy enough to be the governor of Illinois, and that he lacked the slithery, snake-like attributes necessary to oversee the morally bankrupt cesspool of Chicago politics.

"The Philippinesâ€™ acid-tongued president, Rodrigo Duterte, will lead a major business delegation to China this week as Beijing attempts to lure into its orbit one of Americaâ€™s key regional allies in a potential blow to Barack Obamaâ€™s â€œpivotâ€ to Asia.  Hundreds of Filipino entrepreneurs, including some of the countryâ€™s top tycoons, are set to accompany Duterte on his three-day state visit during which he will be received by President Xi Jinping, another strongman leader some call Chinaâ€™s most powerful since Mao Zedong. A spokesperson for Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry said Beijing hoped the visit would â€œhelp increase political mutual trust, strengthen pragmatic cooperation [and] extend traditional friendshipâ€. In a recent speech, Beijingâ€™s ambassador to the Philippines heralded a new dawn for ties between the two countries. â€œThe clouds are fading away. The sun is rising over the horizon, and will shine beautifully on the new chapter of bilateral relations,â€ Zhao Jianhua told a reception in Manila.    Chinese president Xi Jinping speaks at the eighth Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit in the western Indian state of Goa on Sunday. Photograph: Xinhua / Barcroft Images   Duterteâ€™s mission to China follows a succession of anti-American outbursts from the 71-year-old, including calling Obama a â€œson of a whoreâ€ and telling the US president to â€œgo to hellâ€. Those withering statements have led some to conclude Duterte is plotting a historic diplomatic rupture with the Philippinesâ€™ long-standing ally, from which it gained independence in 1946.  At some point, â€œI will break up with Americaâ€, Duterte said in a recent speech at a synagogue in Manila. â€œI would rather go to Russia and to China.â€  Speaking on the eve of Duterteâ€™s visit to Beijing, the top US diplomat for east Asia, Daniel Russel, admitted Washington was still grappling with the policy implications of the Filipino leaderâ€™s â€œcolourfulâ€ statements.  Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, said it was too soon to judge whether Duterteâ€™s mission represented the start of a new diplomatic era in which Manila switched its allegiances to Beijing or was simply an attempt to play the worldâ€™s two biggest economies off against each other.    Iâ€™m not sure anybody is completely clear what is in Duterteâ€™s mind.  Bonnie Glaser, Centre for Strategic and International Studies    â€œIâ€™m not sure anybody is completely clear what is in Duterteâ€™s mind,â€ she said.  Even so, Glaser said Beijing would be celebrating how the Philippinesâ€™ leader had publicly spurned the countryâ€™s long-term ally.  â€œI think the Chinese are rather gleeful about the possibility of a loosening of the US-Philippines alliance. The Chinese believe the US has emboldened Manila to challenge China and has been instrumental in pulling the US into South China Sea issues. If China can successful defuse some of the tensions with the Philippines â€¦ then I think the Chinese hope they can reduce US involvement in the South China Sea.â€ Nick Bisley, an international relations professor from Melbourneâ€™s La Trobe University, said that for all the â€œsurface-level fireworksâ€ surrounding the Philippinesâ€™ president, he was in fact a pragmatic politician who would travel to China with clearly defined domestic objectives.  â€œHeâ€™s not going into this thinking he is some sort of Kissinger of the south Pacific.â€ Rather, Duterte was hoping to secure billions of dollars of much-needed investment to address a looming infrastructure crisis. â€œHe sees China as a pretty likely source of that.â€ Duterteâ€™s trip is the strongest hint yet of a stunning diplomatic volte-face towards China from the Philippines.  In recent years the two countries repeatedly clashed over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, with Beijing reacting furiously in 2014 after Duterteâ€™s predecessor, Benigno Aquino, compared its activities in the region to Nazi Germanyâ€™s expansionism.  â€œAt what point do you say, â€˜Enough is enoughâ€™? Well, the world has to say it â€“ remember that the Sudetenland was given in an attempt to appease Hitler to prevent world war two,â€ he told the New York Times.  In July, just weeks after Duterteâ€™s landslide election victory, an international tribunal issued a thorough rebuttal of Chinaâ€™s territorial claims in the South China Sea when it ruled on a case originally brought by the Philippines government, in 2013.  But Duterte â€“ who has described his trip to China as â€œa key turning point in both our historiesâ€ â€“ has not pressed Beijing over the tribunalâ€™s ruling, apparently seeking to use that verdict as leverage with which to extract concessions from Beijing. Last week he instructed the countryâ€™s navy to halt joint patrols of the South China Sea with the US in order to avoid â€œany Philippine action that China might deem hostileâ€. In an interview last week with al-Jazeera, Duterte said that during his visit he would fight to maintain islands in the South China Sea. â€œNobody is going to give up anything there,â€ he said, adding that under the constitution, a president cannot give away Philippine ground. But he added that although he would raise the Hague tribunal verdict, he could not be forceful. â€œWe have this judgment. I can go into a rage because itâ€™s being occupied ... the other [option] is to talk. What do you think will happen to my country if I choose to go to war?â€ he said. â€œWe can only talk.â€  Experts say Duterte will seek billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of Chinese investment to bankroll projects including as an ambitious network of rail links. Francis Chua, the head of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told the Inquirer he would seek to â€œreawakenâ€ dormant trade ties with Beijing. He said: â€œWe expect to have a bounty of business opportunities from this visit, especially with a president willing to explore the limits of a fruitful partnership with China.â€ Duterte is also expected to press for Filipino fishermen to be allowed to fish around the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed area in the South China Sea.  Bisley said it was crucial the president could return from China with tangible achievements to show voters.  â€œHe needs to have face in this whole thing. He canâ€™t come back to the Philippines looking like heâ€™s gone on bended knee and heâ€™s got all these gifts but is really a Chinese catâ€™s paw,â€ he said.  Bisley said he believed Washington had been â€œgenuinely surprisedâ€ by Duterteâ€™s actions since taking office but cautioned that a permanent shift towards Beijing was far from guaranteed.  â€œIt is still really early days. Heâ€™s three months in and he moves around a lot. It could well be that if he feels slighted in Beijing for whatever reason â€“ if he feels it doesnâ€™t go his way â€“ he could easily just come back to Manila and pretend it all hasnâ€™t happened and tell everybody how much he loves America. You canâ€™t rule that out.â€",1
"The bidding war over the 2010 FIFA World Cup continues to rage between television networks, with multimillion-dollar sums being offered for the rights to show something other than soccer's greatest spectacle. 'When the World Cup begins this June, millions of viewers across the nation will be tuning into something, anything, else,' said ESPN program director Lisa Hibbing, whose network is currently losing the bidding war and may be forced to air more than 60 matches. 'Considering ESPN's main demographicyoung male sports fansand taking into account the time difference between the U.S. and South Africa, and reflecting on our reputation as a sports channel, we'd much rather be showing car-product infomercials at that hour of the morning.

When asked for comment, NBC executives said they had 'just barely dodged the Olympic bullet' and that it was someone else's turn. ",0
"The first time that someone urged me to read Elena Ferrante, he mentioned her anonymity, along with her evocation of Naples, and her peerless representation of womenâ€™s friendships, as among her most impressive qualities. This was in 2013, shortly after the critic James Wood had introduced Ferrante to readers of the New Yorker, in an essay that dwelt on her anonymity. â€œCompared with Ferrante,â€ Wood wrote, â€œThomas Pynchon is a publicity profligate.â€ A few things were known about the writer, thanks to Ferranteâ€™s generosity with written interviews, which routinely feature her anonymity. She grew up in Naples. She had a classics degree. She believed books should stand alone. Wood quoted a letter to her publisher, from 1991. â€œI believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors. If they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they wonâ€™t.â€   Related: Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows   Enough of her readers now appear to share this austere analysis to justify a thorough rethink, in the media, of its coverage of novelists. â€œNo one really wanted to know the identity of Elena Ferrante,â€ wrote Frances Wilson, in the Times Literary Supplement. In which case, maybe people donâ€™t, really, want to know about John le CarrÃ©â€™s dad or the latest revelations about Elizabeth Jane Howard. Weâ€™re above all that. â€œLetâ€™s restore authentic centrality to the books themselves,â€ Ferrante says. Mercifully for her publisher, Ferranteâ€™s books did find many thousands of readers, after which speculation about her identity intensified, even among admirers of her work. Wood, for example, mentioned a rumour about an Italian novelist, Domenico Starnone. He guessed at confessional reasons for her reticence, such as only confirmed her honesty. â€œAs soon as you read her fiction, Ferranteâ€™s restraint seems wisely self-protective.â€ Thereâ€™s an echo of the conjecture that followed the publication of Jane Eyre, under the name Currer Bell. â€œWho, indeed, but a woman,â€ wrote one reviewer, â€œcould have ventured, with the smallest prospect of success, to fill three octavo volumes with the history of a womanâ€™s heart?â€ The earlier review is quoted in a brilliant study by John Mullan, Anonymity: A Secret History of English Literature, in which context Ferranteâ€™s reticence and the avid response to it look far more like a return to literary convention than a rebuke to celebrity culture. As with Charlotte BrontÃ«, it was a matter of time, given the sales and adulation, before Elena Ferrante was identified. Following years of false starts, a reporter, Claudio Gatti, now exposes his â€œsuspectâ€, in the manner of a police sergeant, as the Roman-based translator, Anita Raja. That Raja is married to Starnone is unlikely to end speculation about his involvement. As for Gatti, his reward, to date, has been sustained abuse. A British journalist proposed him as â€œthe most despised Italian on the planetâ€ and said he deserved to be bashed on the head, Ukip style, with a copy of My Brilliant Friend. The TLS editor, Stig Abell, protested that exposure had been achieved in the beastliest sort of way, involving money, as opposed to via the more agreeable, practical criticism. If only Gatti had been nicer, less Brexity, or better still, a woman. Abell is not alone in recoiling from a painfully gendered pursuit, of a woman who told the Financial Timesâ€™s Liz Jobey: â€œMale power, whether violently or delicately imposed, is still bent on subordinating us.â€ While the wretched Gatti is excoriated, anyone who shares his interest might as well, you gather, admit to a sneaking respect for Mazher Mahmood. The Booker prize winner Marlon James wrote on Facebook:, â€œSeriously though, who is this NYRB [New York Review of Books]Elena Ferrante article for? What kind of person supports this shit and cared to find out?â€   The public know almost as little about Ferrante, unveiled, as they did before   OK, this kind. Iâ€™m glad we know who wrote Jane Eyre and where she lived. And Iâ€™m curious about Ferrante. Not merely because I belong to the same, debased trade as Gatti and do not share my friendsâ€™ enthusiasm for the novelist. Despite dogged attempts to enjoy Ferrante â€“ and to suppress conjecture about an oddly male glint, in some scenes â€“ I find Neapolitan novels fiction (the interviews are great) much as I did the magic realism of the 80s: lurid and prolix. It came as no surprise to find Salman Rushdie posting in Ferranteâ€™s support, notwithstanding his own generous offering, to inquisitive readers, of Joseph Anton, in which true-life romances are thrillingly explored. But individual taste has no bearing on the principle that Elena Ferrante had a right to concealment. Whether she could reasonably expect full compliance, once she was revered and famous, sole cause of a tourism spike in Naples, is a different matter. JK Rowling, discussing her own outing as the detective writer Robert Galbraith, sounded resigned. â€œI always knew if the books had any success, it would become harder and harder to remain anonymous because, quite reasonably, people would say, well, I would like to interview him or ask him some questions.â€ In that respect people are unchanged since they enjoyed guessing â€“ as they were sometimes intended to â€“ about the authorship, among others, of The Rape of the Lock, Gulliverâ€™s Travels, Joseph Andrews, Pride and Prejudice, Ivanhoe, Frankenstein, Evelina, Mary Barton, Middlemarch, Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland, Father and Son, The Bell Jar, The Diaries of Jane Somers. â€œA good proportion of what is now English literature,â€ John Mullan writes, â€œconsists of works first published, like The Rape of the Lock, without their authorsâ€™ names.â€ Seriously, again to quote Marlon James, what kind of person supports this shit and cared to find out? Might they not be Ferranteâ€™s admirers? In his time, Thackeray was not above biographical speculation. â€œI have been exceedingly moved and pleased by Jane Eyre. It is a womanâ€™s writing, but whose?â€ The English reading world, Elizabeth Gaskell wrote in her biography of BrontÃ«, â€œwas in a ferment to discover the unknown author.â€ Insisting on the gendered aspect of the Ferrante outrage, some have argued, not entirely unlike women who defend the burqa, that Gatti violated a self-effacement that is peculiarly womanly. If so â€“ and that behaviour did not originate with patriarchal restrictions on female writers â€“ there is, still, the consolation that the public knows almost as little about Ferrante, unveiled, as it did before. As intended, her books prospered under anonymity, they speak for themselves and no loyal reader will care if she wasnâ€™t raised in Naples, a disclosure that only accords with Ferrante, in Vanity Fair, on â€œthe centrality of the workâ€. For the tiny number of Ferrante-resistant readers, the violence of last weekâ€™s response may be as interesting as the unmasking. Whatâ€™s this sudden consensus, among eager consumers of author interviews and confessions, from regular participants in literary festivals and talks, that a decent reader is interested only in texts? Should publishers accordingly trim, if such a thing were possible, their publicity budgets? Or does that strange phenomenon â€“ Ferrante fever â€“ account for an anti-biographical fury that remained dormant during the exposures, respectively, of Belle de Jour, JK Rowling and Banksy? True, Ferrante threatened never to publish again. But that was as the novelist raised in Naples.",1
"A host of high-ranking insect leaders convened in Canada for the annual G20,000,000,000 summit Friday, addressing various challenges facing todays insects and promoting stability among the global bug population. The two-day conference, held this year in a secluded, heavily wooded area of the Ottawa National Forest, reportedly includes various insect representatives from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as over 15,000 different species of beetles from Australia invited as non-member delegates. The decisions made at the G20,000,000,000 will greatly affect all 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 insects around the world, said John Cavagnaro, chair of the International Society of Entomology. This is where the most pressing issues for modern-day insects are tackled head-on, and it provides a forum for these powerful rulers to deliberate over diminishing nectar supplies, ways to achieve sustainable nest growth, and new forms of cross-pollination. But perhaps its most vital function is to diffuse any tensions between colonies by opening up direct lines of communication through antennae and stridulation, Cavagnaro added. According to those present, the first days proceedings began with a discussion of efforts to combat worryingly high larval mortality rates in Africa, which then reportedly led to a joint proposal from various mosquito delegates advocating universal access to stagnant water. The insect representatives also reportedly voted down a controversial plan to ban flying toward big bright lights. Tempers were said to later flare up as a coalition of bees, hornets, and yellow jackets vehemently opposed initiatives introduced by several influential wingless insects to reduce global swarming. All 20,000,000,000 parties, however, reportedly unanimously agreed upon tighter security measures for protecting insect queens, although leaders differed on which specific queens safety was of paramount importance. Sources said there was then a brief intermission during which leaders frantically feasted on a dead mouse. As in past summits, one major point of debate is the ongoing threat of dangerous arachnid groups, said Cavagnaro, adding that violence between the invertebrates continues on a daily basis. Views are still largely divided5,500,000,000 members are in favor of attacking the spiders, 7,000,000,000 have pushed for diplomatic resolutions, and the remaining 6,500,000,000 are staunchly refusing any engagement whatsoever out of fear of getting caught in webs and eaten. There is growing optimism regarding potential peace talks, Cavagnaro added. That said, this bitter conflict dates back 400 million years, and very little headway has been made in that time. Originally known as the G8,000,000,000, the global conference was launched 51 million years ago to protect general insect interests in the wake of the tragic extinction of the Eorpidae scorpionfly. Among its founding members were black vine weevils, desert locusts, diamondback moths, and ladybugs, but the group has since reportedly grown to collectively account for roughly 90 percent of all animal lifeforms on earth. Many within the general insect population, though, remain skeptical of the G20,000,000,000s actual impact, claiming that rather than working toward effective policy changes, leaders often resort to secreting petty territorial pheromones. G20,000,000,000 members have also come under fire over a perceived lack of action against pesticide, with critics accusing the leaders of ignoring the systematic extermination of millions of insects. The summit has been facing mounting pressure to take decisive steps to stop the widespread, indiscriminate gassing of wasp hives, said Cavagnaro, adding that critics have frequently condemned the group for failing to prevent such atrocities and devoting far too much time to masticating plant leaves. Meanwhile, countless worker ants occupying sidewalk cracks have been killed or displaced by mass floods of hose water, not to mention the thousands, perhaps even millions of ant hills destroyed in foot traffic every day. Unless something is done soon, these crises will sadly be the burden of future generations of hymenopterans, Cavagnaro added. At press time, the G20,000,000,000 had abruptly concluded after a small bird flew overhead, causing all insect leaders to scatter. ",0
"White Veteran Stabbed To Death By Thugs Yelling Slurs In Lakewood, Washington, a 20-year-old soldier named Tevin Geike was stabbed to death in a parking lot. According to reports, he was walking along the Pacific Highway SW with two other white soldiers when a group of black men drove by and yelled at the group. Allegedly, the men driving by were yelling racial slurs, and when one of the soldiers responded, the car turned around. Then, the driver of the vehicle recognized that they were fighting soldiers. One of the suspects bumped into Geike, and the soldiers saw him fall to the ground. Meanwhile, the car sped away into the distance. Geike bled to death from multiple stab wounds. He was already dead in my brothers arms, Glenn Zimmerman, a friend of Geike, told reporters. The group of soldiers had been at a party that night, celebrating the end of Geikes contract, and honoring his service to his country. I dont understand how someone can do thisthat man, he almost gave his life for people to enjoy the freedoms they have and he was just stabbed for no reason, Zimmerman continued. Given the racial implications of the incident, investigators are considering whether the killing is classified as a hate crime. In the meantime, Police are searching for the vehicle and the five suspects, all five of whom are black men in their 20s. ",0

"Donald Trump and Chabuddy G from the TV show People Just Do Nothing have a lot in common. Both of their heads have been colonised by dubious coiffures. Both are consumed by the rampant desire for a quick buck. Also they are both Asian.   Related: People Just Do Nothing: 'We're the Beatles of Brentford'   Or at least they are in the new short film Donald Mohammed Trump. Starring PJDNâ€™s Asim Chaudhry, itâ€™s a surreal satire that follows US politicsâ€™ favourite grabber of genitalia as heâ€™s 20 minutes late to go onstage at a rally. The crowd are ready: theyâ€™ve been pre-filled with a paranoid hatred of other cultures (they even demanded Bruce Springsteenâ€™s birth certificate after Born in the USA played). But thereâ€™s a slight problem: their leader has inexplicably turned into a man of Asian appearance â€“ not ideal for a politician with a reputation for whipping up a spot of Islamophobic hatred. â€œI just loved the idea of making Trump face up to the reality of the things he preaches,â€ says Chaudhry. In the film, Donald M Trump is hastily caked in quick-fix makeup, put in a wig and shoved onstage. His supporters do not react kindly. â€œWhen you incite hatred, it never leads to beautiful things, does it? It always leads to violence.â€    Itâ€™s not the demonisation of Trump you might expect, though. This is partly because Chaudhry was told not to do an impersonation: â€œIâ€™d watched hours and hours of Trump to get the accent right, then the director goes: â€˜Donâ€™t. I want you to be humanâ€™.â€ But mainly because itâ€™s more about the politics than the man; Chaudhryâ€™s portrayal leaves Trump seeming less like a monster than a puppet of dark forces beyond his control. â€œThe message really is about the agenda,â€ he explains. â€œIt is about Trump, but only because heâ€™s the latest person preaching this stuff.â€ This Trump isnâ€™t a Machiavellian villain; heâ€™s a fool with no idea what heâ€™s unleashing.   Related: From Back to the Future's Biff to Donald Trump: how pop culture can make a president   Playing him was still scary, though. And thereâ€™s something deeply unsettling about the monumental makeover that let a 30-year-old Asian man play a 70-year old bequiffed caucasian. â€œI looked like a monster!â€ laughs Chaudhry. â€œI couldnâ€™t leave the green room because I didnâ€™t want to scare kids.â€ Not least because he bears a fair similarity to a certain ex-Mayor of London. â€œI look exactly like Boris from behind! Boris with a rugby-playing build!â€ The project is a labour of love for Chaudhry, raised a Muslim in a world where the association of â€œIslamâ€ and â€œterroristâ€ has become normal. â€œItâ€™s so real to me,â€ he says. â€œI know what it is to live in a world where people judge you straight away on your race and religion.â€ The same is true of the rest of the crew, who threw the film together on such a shoestring budget that the on-set catering facilities consisted of the directorâ€™s mum knocking up snacks. The hope of the film, presumably, is to avoid the scary prospect of Trumpâ€™s policies actually coming to pass? â€œI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m scared. But the Muslim ban is ridiculous. How would he even enforce it? Like, Iâ€™m not a practicing Muslim but my mum is. Howâ€™s that gonna work at the border?â€ he sighs. â€œUltimately though, Iâ€™m worried about all the hatred. Iâ€™m hoping this might hold a mirror up to it.â€ He pauses. â€œAnd Iâ€™m hoping that when people look in the mirror they see that whatâ€™s looking back isnâ€™t a pretty picture.â€",1
"The requests, at once, seemed obvious and yet somewhat counterintuitive: Lawyers for Dean G. Skelos and his son, Adam B. Skelos, suggested that their clients should avoid prison time, despite their convictions on corruption charges.Naturally, the Skeloses would rather not spend a day behind bars. And because they have maintained their innocence and are expected to appeal, it seems logical for them to resist overt statements of contrition.But their requests for no prison time â€” they have asked instead to perform substantial amounts of community service â€” could run the risk of backfiring, particularly in a corruption case in which both men were convicted of all eight counts they faced; some lawyers believe that asking to avoid prison in such circumstances is tantamount to thumbing your nose at the judge, the jury and justice.When a federal judge decides this month on the appropriate sentences for Dean Skelos, the former majority leader of the New York State Senate, and Adam, the choice could be stark. Prosecutors are expected to seek stiff prison sentences for each man; they are expected to file a sentencing memorandum on Monday.Probation requests in public corruption cases are not unprecedented; lawyers sought it for former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, who in 2014 was convicted in a corruption case and ultimately received a two-year sentence.In New York, probation may be harder to obtain, given that prosecutors have portrayed the State Capitol in Albany as riddled with corruption and may argue that any sentence should send a message that such activity will not be tolerated.â€œThereâ€™s already a perception that political insiders get all sorts of benefits,â€ said Douglas A. Berman, a sentencing expert at Ohio State University. As for the Skeloses, he said, prosecutors will probably argue that â€œwe should not aggravate that perception by now giving them a slap on the wrist, especially given that theyâ€™ve been found guilty.â€The Skelosesâ€™ requests prompted varying reactions from lawyers and others in the criminal justice system.â€œUnfortunately for Dean Skelos,â€ the veteran defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman said, â€œif he were not a high-profile public official, it would be easier to ask for, and possibly even get, a sentence of probation.â€œBut the argument the government always makes in cases like this,â€ Mr. Brafman continued, â€œis that the court should focus on the issue of general deterrence above all of the other factors, even those that may be compelling in an ordinary case.â€Federal judges typically rely on sentencing guidelines, along with a recommended sentence by the trial courtâ€™s probation office after it investigates a defendant and the circumstances of the offense. Judges are not bound by the guidelines but must consider them.Jessica A. Roth, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, said that because the recommendations of the probation office, the prosecution and the defense can have â€œan anchoring effectâ€ on a judge, there may be â€œa strategic benefitâ€ for the defense to seek probation, to try to â€œset that anchor low.â€John S. Martin, a former federal judge and United States attorney in Manhattan, concurred. However unlikely a probationary sentence may seem, he said, â€œit doesnâ€™t mean necessarily that itâ€™s wrong to ask for it.â€â€œYou may be trying to soften the judge up,â€ he said, â€œso he or she imposes a sentence of three years rather than five.â€Still, lawyers do not want to make a request that is so off base that a judge disregards their other arguments for leniency, Paul Shechtman, a defense lawyer, said.â€œItâ€™s not for you to paint a negative picture of your client,â€ Mr. Shechtman said, â€œbut if you paint too rosy a picture, the judge knows sheâ€™s in the wrong gallery.â€Guideline determinations in the Skelosesâ€™ case are not yet public, but Adam Skelosâ€™s lawyer, Christopher P. Conniff, wrote to Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan that the defense had calculated the sonâ€™s guideline range to be six and a half to eight years in prison.Prosecutors are likely to argue for greater sentences, for both Adam Skelos, 33, and his 68-year-old father, a Republican from Long Island, who were each convicted in December of charges including bribery, conspiracy and extortion.Mr. Conniff, in seeking probation for Adam, said in a submission to the court that a lengthy sentence would have a â€œsignificant and potentially long-term detrimental effect onâ€ his clientâ€™s two young sons, who are both autistic.Dean Skelosâ€™s lawyers, G. Robert Gage Jr. and Joseph B. Evans, wrote that they were not trying to â€œminimize the seriousnessâ€ of their clientâ€™s crimes, but they wanted Judge Wood to balance Mr. Skelosâ€™s â€œlifetime of good works against the aberrational conduct that resulted in the conviction.â€Both menâ€™s filings included letters from family members and other supporters, like the lawyer David L. Lewis, a friend of the family, who wrote that Dean Skelosâ€™s conviction had been â€œthe raw equivalent of a death in the family,â€ and asked for leniency in the case.In another letter, Charles P. Silverstein, a nephew of the former senator, said the public would benefit more if the elder Mr. Skelos received probation and community service. â€œAfter all, he has dedicated his whole career to serving the public,â€ Mr. Silverstein said.Lawyers who sought probation or relatively short sentences in other corruption cases have had varying degrees of success.Carl Kruger, a former Democratic state senator from Brooklyn who prosecutors had called â€œone of the most influential power brokers in Albany,â€ pleaded guilty in 2011 in a bribery case, for which prosecutors sought a sentence within the guideline range of about nine to 11 years.Mr. Krugerâ€™s lawyer, Mr. Brafman, writing to the judge, did not request a specific number of years but asked for â€œa short period of incarceration,â€ well below the guideline range. Mr. Kruger was sentenced to seven years.The lawyers for former State Senator Malcolm A. Smith, a Democrat from Queens convicted in a bribery case, asked for a sentence of one year plus one day. (Only inmates who receive more than one year are eligible for a reduction of their sentence based on good behavior, whereas a one-year sentence must be served in its entirety.) He received seven years.Gerald L. Shargel, who represented Mr. Smith, said the defense gave much thought to the request for a short sentence. â€œObviously, the judgeâ€™s view of the case was substantially different from ours,â€ Mr. Shargel said, â€œbut thatâ€™s what litigation is all about.â€In seeking probation in the case of Mr. McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, his lawyers proposed he also perform 6,000 hours of â€œrigorousâ€ community service, like working and living in spartan conditions in Virginiaâ€™s impoverished Appalachian region.Mr. McDonnellâ€™s lead lawyer, Henry W. Asbill, said he believed that â€œunder the facts of this case,â€ the decision to seek probation and community service for the former governor â€œwas very reasonable.â€â€œI donâ€™t make a habit of making ridiculous requests to judges that I know are going to lose me credibility,â€ Mr. Asbill said. Mr. McDonnellâ€™s wife, Maureen, who was also convicted and had sought probation, received a sentence of a year and a day.",1

"NY Rep Wants to Criminalize 3D-Printed WeaponsAmanda Warren After his staff stumbled on the footage, Israel decided he would renew the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 and then add a ban on the manufacturing, ownership, or transport of both 3D printed firearms and high-capacity magazines. Actually, hed been eyeing the renewal for awhile and you may have been hearing about it along with recent 3D capabilities. The recent video is among the very first to showcase a successful demonstration of automatic firing using a prototype printed 30-round magazine for an AR-15. Approximately 86 rounds are fired at various speeds in the following video posted January 12th, 2013. I thought it had gone viral but it only has around 200K hits that means many still havent seen this amazing milestone. Some companies like the non-profit firearms group Defense Distributed even offer their blueprints for free as their name suggests. As of a few days ago, over 2,200 blueprints were downloaded they are the Home of the Wiki Weapon. An interview with DD founder Cody Wilson last week emphasized what a gamechanger this working model is. Along with laws like Steve Israels, a patent is reportedly in the works to hoard control of this technology. Cant have individuals successfully decentralizing, cant have free market or relief from a burdened economy. JG Vibes who often reports on 3D printing, compared it to the traditional case of the candlemaker trying to prevent the discovery of electric light. Heres a head-scratcher: Israel acknowledges that the law is difficult to enforce (seriously, can we say SWAT raid increases and Orwellian surveillance?) but wants to ensure everyone that this law isnt aimed at owners of 3D printers. Huh? Were not going to solve every problem No law can do that. What were trying to do is deal with a very specific problem, which is the lone wolf who uses a 3D printer to make a plastic weapon in his home that can be brought onto a plane or into a secure environment. Not aimed at owners but at aimed at the lone wolf who uses one meaning anyone who uses one or pays for a print. This law would have far reach because whats to say anyone possessing any type of 3D printer couldnt print guns and magazines? This could clamp the field of 3D printing but, of course, not for elites who want to keep the capability to produce 3D military weapons and drones to themselves. This is, however, not bad news. It is to be expected that lawmakers and corporations will clamp such innovations to keep defense technology out of the hands of individuals. But to positively reframe this story, lets keep in mind that at this point, 3D printed guns render gun control moot and the possibilities for countless 3D goods are still on the horizon.

"A coalition of natural gas lobby groups are planning a coordinated campaign to convince Australians gas is â€œa long-term necessityâ€, top industry lobbyists have revealed. They also disclosed plans to undermine government attempts to regulate sections of the industry that have been identified by the competition watchdog for price gouging by offering the federal environment minister â€œsomething he can announceâ€ â€“ but which would not amount to regulation.  The president of the Australian Pipeline and Gas Association, Shaun Reardon, told a meeting of the gas industry in Perth last month that the industry had agreed on a message to sell to the public, the industry website Energy News Bulletin reported.   Related: Australia's coal seam gas emissions may be vastly underestimated â€“ report   â€œOur objective is to have gas acknowledged as a long-term necessity by policymakers and the public,â€ Reardon was reported as saying. The chief executive of gas association, Cheryl Cartwright, told Guardian Australia that represenatatives of each of the industry lobby groups had â€œagreed to a united view regarding gasâ€. Cartwright said the industry needed to â€œimprove the public perception of natural gasâ€. â€œBasically, we represent the gas industry,â€ she said. â€œNatural gas is an important part of the energy mix as we encourage Australia to reduce carbon emissions. Itâ€™s cleaner burning than coal, and is an appropriate back-up fuel for renewable energy sources.â€ A report released last month found unmeasured â€œfugitive emissionsâ€ from the gas industry were likely to be as big as those emitted by the entire transport sector. Since fugitive emissions are rarely measured, they are not properly accounted for, and could jeopardise any attempt to meet emissions reduction pledges made in Paris. If fugitive emissions from the coal seam gas industry in Australia were anywhere near what they are in the US, coal seam gas would be worse for the climate than coal. Cartwright said the industry should fight attempts to regulate gas pipelines. In April the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence that â€œa large number of pipeline operators have been engaging in monopoly pricingâ€. The ACCC pointed out that other countries, such as New Zealand and the US, imposed much stronger regulation. Since pipelines are natural monopolies, they are able to dictate prices. â€œIt is well recognised in these jurisdictions that pipelines can wield substantial market power even where producers and users have a number of transportation options,â€ the ACCC said. Cartwright told the conference the federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, had told her he wanted to regulate gas pipelines. â€œMinister Frydenberg actually said to me, quote, â€˜I know supply needs to be addressed but weâ€™re going to fix pipelines first,â€™â€™â€™ Cartwright was reported saying in Energy News Bulletin. â€œBasically, they are convinced there is something wrong and they want to be able to make an announcement,â€ Cartwright reportedly said. Cartwright told the gas industry meeting they needed to give Frydenberg â€œsomething to announceâ€. â€œSo this is what we are up against,â€ she said. â€œNot only do we need to fight back, we have to do it in a way that gives them something to announce and actually I think we can do it.â€ Cartwright told Guardian Australia she understood that looked like an attempt to give the minister a meaningless announcement but that was not the case. She said she was trying to explain to members of the industry â€œwho know nothing about politics â€¦ explaining to them that we canâ€™t just fight back and say everything is working without demonstrating that we are actually doing something to tackle the perception of there being a problemâ€. â€œWe are taking action â€“ not necessarily the action demanded by the regulator, but something thatâ€™ll actually work â€“ and we need to explain that to the ministers so they can be part of the announcements when itâ€™s ready to launch.â€ Cartwright said the plan was to improve transparency of the gas pipeline market through reforms in â€œcapacity tradingâ€, where spare capacity in the pipelines is traded in a transparent process. She said many members of the industry had fought that move â€œbecause it will be expensiveâ€. Responding to the industy lobbyistsâ€™ comments, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia: â€œThe ACCC in a recent report raised its concerns with the current regulatory test as it applies to gas pipelines.   Related: Gas supplies to rise and secret contracts to be scrapped under Coag reform plan   â€œThat is why the [Council of Australian Governments] energy council has asked Dr Michael Vertigan, in consultation with stakeholders and working with the ACCC findings, to draw together what we need to do with the coverage criteria under the national gas law to address this issue. â€œMinisters will consider Dr Vertiganâ€™s report at the next Coag energy council meeting.â€ The Coag energy council announced in August that it had agreed to ban secret pricing contracts in the gas industry. Frydenberg described the change as â€œthe most significant reforms to the domestic gas market in two decadesâ€. It did not propose regulating prices, which other commentators have suggested, but which the gas industry strongly opposes. â€œOf course, if you want to phase out oil and gas completely, you might like the idea of increasing economic regulation, which would stymie investment,â€ Cartwright told Guardian Australia. Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the industry was overdue for regulation. â€œThe pipeline companies are gouging the consumer,â€ he said. â€œThey know it and are fearful that sensible regulation as to price and capacity will come in. Essentially gas transmission pipelines are natural monopolies and Australia is unique in the western world at not regulating them. â€œThe US has far better disclosure rules and still heavily regulates them. In Australia we need both far more comprehensive disclosure on a pipeline by pipeline basis and also strong regulation. Regulation of monopolies is not anti market. No market exists and hence the need for regulation.â€",1

"Trilateral Defense Ministers Meeting Continues to Build North American Security FrameworkDana Gabriel The North American security relationship has evolved with Mexico being increasingly viewed as a valued part of the continental defense team. The U.S., Canada and Mexico are building the framework for greater cooperation on common security issues. They are expanding security arrangements and are further establishing new institutions at a continental level. The trilateral defense ministers meeting, which received very little media attention is part of the process of integrating military planning and coordination into a North American security perimeter. On April 24, Mexicos Secretary of National Defense General Salvador Zepeda Cienfuegos and Naval Secretary Admiral Vidal Francisco Soberon Sanz hosted the Second Trilateral Meeting of North American Defense Ministers with their counterparts, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Canadian Defense Minister Robert Nicholson. A joint statement explained that, Threats to North America and the hemisphere are increasingly complex and require coordinated responses. Building upon the trilateral collaboration under the North American Leaders Summit process, we remain committed to enhancing our common understanding of those threats and developing effective and efficient approaches needed to address them. It went on to say, With this foundation, our countries continue to work together to address the security and defense challenges that our continent faces. We acknowledge that transnational threats require transnational responses and are committed to furthering our collaboration. The Inaugural Meeting of North American Defense Ministers was held in March 2012. In his speech, which focused on security issues facing North America, Secretary Hagel further elaborated on how the trilateral defense meeting is, moving beyond the concept stage and is becoming a venue to develop new opportunities for deeper collaboration and new approaches to more effectively address shared threats and challenges. We have identified important areas where we can work together as equal partners. As we move forward, the discussions today will further strengthen the foundation for continued cooperation in meeting defense and security requirements for our three nations. In order to continue their important trilateral dialogue, Secretary Hagel has offered to host the next defense ministerial in 2016. Back in February, Canada and Mexico also announced plans to further strengthen defense relations. As part of the trilateral defense meeting, they officially signed the Declaration of Intent on Defense Cooperation. The agreement, further solidifies defense relations between Canada and Mexico, and demonstrates commitment by both countries to continue cooperation in areas such as military training, support to civilian authorities, defense research, defense materiel cooperation, defense industry matters, as well as other areas of importance to defense and security. Canadian Defense Minister Robert Nicholson described how, The Trilateral Meeting of North American Defense Ministers has given us a valuable opportunity to further deepen our cooperation and collaboration towards our common goals of ensuring the security of our citizens, and our continent. Signing the Declaration of Intent on Defense Cooperation with Mexico is a demonstration of this cooperation and collaboration, and shows Canadas commitment to deepening the defense component of Canadas longstanding, friendly relations with Mexico. Increased U.S. interest in continental defense continues to have an impact on Canadian and Mexican security policy. Both countries are further adopting American security priorities, which raises concerns regarding sovereignty. Under the guise of stopping drug and illicit arms trafficking, the U.S. seeks to further extend its military and security apparatus into other regions. The trilateral defense ministers meeting is part of the ongoing efforts to establish a fully integrated continental security perimeter and represents another important step towards a North American Union.

"Top 5 Ways to Practice Non-Conformity in the MatrixSigmund Fraud As we grow, we learn how to play and interact with others, and we learn how others react to us. We begin to develop an understanding of which behavior is acceptable and which is not; and if we are paying attention, we realize that there is a subtle system of rewards and punishments involved in social interaction. Adherence to this system is what keeps society together, and depending on what rewards and punishments appeal to us, we choose which ideas and behaviors to conform to and comply with. As a result, different societal roles become open to us. The new rebel then, the new hero, is someone, anyone, who combats the staleness of a decaying society by looking at the areas in our lives most in need of repair and then, deliberately, does not do what the conformist majority is doing. This is the thoughtful person who applies the knowledge and information we have available today in the pursuit of living in creative ways that defy the herd and defend life and liberty. In no particular order, here are the top five ways to practice non-conformity in the world that we have created for ourselves the matrix of self-destruction. Monetary Non-conformity The human race is enslaved to a corrupt and inflationary monetary system. To act as a balance to this, any opportunity to conduct life without using the dollar and the credit system is a stunning act of non-conformity. By practicing trade, barter and local exchange, and using alternative currencies whenever possible, a practical statement is made in support of an alternative to central bank tyranny and manipulation. Most important, however, is the simple decision to spend less overall and live without consumer debt. Shun the Materialistic and the Entertainment Driven Lifestyle The consumption of consumer goods in our world has grown to dangerous proportions, and no matter your political bent, you cant deny the existence of the plastic ocean gaining mass in the Pacific. To be realistic about ones true needs and to consume less stuff makes one stand out as a non-conformist in todays culture. Much of this consumerism is part of a lifestyle of entertainment that we have developed in recent decades. We seem to value being entertained more than anything else, and we will do anything, and incur any debt, in order to get that which entertains and distracts us. Choosing a non-consumeristic, non-entertainment driven lifestyle is an important act of disobedience to the norm. Health Rebel The truth about the condition of American health is ugly, and clearly something is wrong with the conformist ideas of diet and health. From horse meat, to high-fructose corn syrup, to GMOs, the conformist diet is deathly harmful to our well-being. To continue on with this unhealthy lifestyle is self-destructive, and to buck this trend simply means to take care of yourself properly, as we all should be doing anyway. Taking care of the body is easy and enjoyable, and each step towards health brings with it a renewed outlook on life. Taking control of diet, finding some enjoyable type of exercise, and being courageous enough to try out alternative, non-pharmaceutical modalities of healing when possible, are, oddly enough, all one has to do in order to stand out as a health non-conformist. Re-Education The quality of the future can be seen in the quality of our youth, and the current models of building quality people seem to be falling short. Trying out new modalities of education for our children is an inspiring way to work towards a better vision for the future. Green schooling, homeschooling and even un-schooling children offer hope for something different from the next generation. With access to unlimited educational resources via the Internet, almost anyone can educate themselves in almost any field, and so the re-education of the individual is an act of great non-conformity. Experience-Based Spirituality The nature of personal spirituality itself is evolving in these transformative times as people have access to a vast assortment of ideas, philosophies, wisdom traditions, substances, and dogmas. The non-conformist of today explores practices and ideas that work best to induce direct experience, following intuition to develop a connection to the sacred part of humanity, which is so routinely trampled in our hectic world. Finding inner peace through whichever religion or philosophy you choose is critical to creating a world free from toxic effects of collective fear. There is a war being waged against the conscience and consciousness of the average person, and seeking direct, personal spiritual experience and connection to the great mystery is the way to prevail. The normal, conformist modality of human behavior seems to be contributing to and exacerbating the problems of this world, rather than helping to eradicate them or working to alleviate suffering. To assist in the collective shift toward a means of living and being that sustains life rather than ensures self-destruction is as easy as practicing non-conformity whenever possible.

"Experts Fear a Stealth Economic Collapse Has Already BegunBy Mac Slavo The world doubled down on risk after the 2008 crisis with nearly unlimited liquidity, and now debt is threatening to drown the global financial market. Cheap credit is about to saddle down those who got themselves overextended. Many private borrowers and states alike face default, bankruptcy and/or a failure to pay their obligations. Mathematically, the problem is just waiting to explode. It is just a matter of when the music stops. But has it already? Some are suggesting that things are already so bad that a crash has already set in, but without the headlines and fanfare. This stealth crash is evidenced by conditions so bad they precipitate a chain reaction of further financial destruction. According to the London Guardian things are simply too far gone: the debt levels are too high, productivity growth too weak and financial risks too threatening. Via the London Guardian: A predicted global meltdown passed without event. But there are enough warning signs to suggest we are sleepwalking into another disaster The 1st of October came and went without financial armageddon. Veteran forecaster Martin Armstrong, who accurately predicted the 1987 crash, used the same model to suggest that 1October would be a major turning point for global markets. Some investors even put bets on it. But the passing of the predicted global crash is only good news to a point. Many indicators in global finance are pointing downwards and some even think the crash has begun. Lets assemble the evidence. First, the unsustainable debt. Since 2007, the pile of debt in the world has grown by $57tn (37tn). Thats acompound annual growth rate of 5.3%, significantly beating GDP. Debts have doubled in the so-called emerging markets, while rising by just over a third in the developed world.[] What weve done with credit since the global crisis of 2008 is expand it faster than the economy which can only be done rationally if we think the future is going to be much richer than the present.This summer, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out that certain major economies were seeing a sharp rise in debt-to-GDP ratios, which were well outside historic norms. In China, the rest of Asia and Brazil, private-sector borrowing has risen so quickly that BISs dashboard of risk is flashing red. In two thirds of all cases, red warnings such as this are followed by amajor banking crisis within three years.The underlying cause of this debt glut is the $12tn of free or cheap money created by central banks since 2009, combined with near-zero interest rates. When the real price of money is close to zero, people borrow and worry about the consequences later.Oil collapsed first, in mid 2014, falling from $110 abarrel to $49 now, despite a slight rebound in the interim. [] In short, as the BIS economists put it, this is aworld in which debt levels are too high, productivity growth too weak and financial risks too threatening. Its impossible to extrapolate from all this the date the crash will happen, or the form it will take. No one knows when an official crash is going to take place, or if they would recognize it if it were already here, but wealth is being transferred at an incredible rate that is driving people into poverty, dependence and desperation. What is clear is that the financial system that has been put in place is apparently not even capable of holding things together for a decade before they fall apart again. The same Federal Reserve that was supposedly put in place to end volatile booms and busts is today directly creating them. Monetary policy is perhaps the driving force of todays misfortune. The situation is reaching a dangerous quickening point, if it has not already arrived. As the article noted, When the real price of money is close to zero, people borrow and worry about the consequences later. But the consequences are piling up. The entire economy rests on the actions of the Fed, which is engaged in massive market manipulation albeit legal under the powers assumed by this private agency. Admittedly, the Fed is inflating the stock market, all while destroying the jobs, business, savings, investments and opportunities of regular people. If Yellen raises rates, the debt crunch begins, and there may be nothing that can hold back the bloods-in-the-streets level of crisis that will occur when people across the world can no longer pay, and cant borrow any more. There may be higher rates within a year. Meanwhile, the Fed continues to float enormous volumes of money to feed the looming disaster. It is worsening, and many are already over the edge. As financial experts put it months ago, the market today is uniquely crash prone. Things have been set-up to fail, and giving the Federal Reserve more power than ever to control the markets has only assured the next phase of the collapse will be even worse. You can read more from Mac Slavo at his site SHTFplan.com yeah.ive heard this doomer story since 2008/2009. anything else? Yes. Everybody heard it from 2001 up until to 2008. Then it happened. Then next one is just a certain. Its magnitude will make 2008 look like a non event. FEAR FEAR AND MORE FEAR.SCREW UPIF YOU THINK ITS ALL GONNA CRASH THEN GO OUT AND BORROW TILL THE COWS COME HOMESTASH THE MONEY AND FILE FOR BANKRUPTCYISNT THAT HOW THE 1% DO ITITS WHAT TRUMP DID 4 TIMES. It started back in 1913 with the creation of the illegal Federal Reserve and income taxes. Nixon gave it a BOOST when he took US off the gold standard. FREE MONEY and CREDIT for EVERYONE!!! Now you know why the debt is not considered mathematically un-payable. Boom and bust is the business cycle. Just like life, you are born, grow, mature, get old, die! The attempts to smooth out the cycle only exacerbate the situation. Bankruptcy allows the economy to re-allocate capital to more productive ends. ",0
"See Michelle Obamas Hypocritical Question After Complaining About Money In Politics First Lady Michelle Obama has been making headlines again after speaking at a fundraiser and complaining that there is too much money in politics. Of course, to those that know the history of the Obamas, the statement is extraordinarily hypocritical.

She told them that writing a check could be the difference they need to hold position in the White House. She said that the money would also be used to help Obama make progress.

"As part of its routine series of preparedness drills aimed at testing national security, the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it had set free the five most deadly foreign terrorists in U.S. custody. 'Protecting the American people is our highest priority, so it is crucial that we periodically put our country's safeguards to the test,' DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said during a press conference. 'Only by loosing these dangerous extremists on our infrastructure, landmarks, and chemical or nuclear facilities can we properly assess our vulnerability to terrorist attacks.' 'If the Empire State Building or Jefferson Memorial blows up, for example, then we'll know we have to make some improvements,' she added. 'It's all part of the process.' The terrorists were reportedly transported separately by helicopter to undisclosed locations across the country and supplied with clothing, $10,000 cash, and a list of contacts known for making statements about crushing the U.S. government. The DHS also confirmed that the terrorists, who vowed nothing would stop them from their ultimate goal of destroying all of America, received a $100 Home Depot gift card for incidentals and supplies. 'To ensure the reliability of this exercise, not a single DHS employee or any federal or local law enforcement officers know where the terrorists are,' Napolitano said. 'We will give them a 48-hour head start before distributing their pictures and launching a nationwide search.' 'In the meantime, we will have no contact with them, and will allow these talented and barbaric war criminals to do what they do best,' Napolitano added. Homeland Security officials said the drill will provide vital information on exactly how easily a hypothetical group of terrorists could exploit vastly underprotected and insufficiently funded areas such as Yosemite National Park, the Hoover Dam, most of the North American power grid, or virtually any U.S. port. The department's deputy secretary, Jane Holl Lute, who personally analyzed background information on each of the incarcerated terrorists, said the 'final five' were selected for the high level of risk they posed to the United States, their experience developing and executing terror plots, and their knowledge of explosives, as well as their overall remorselessness and leadership qualities. The group comprises alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; senior al- Qaeda member Abu Faraj al-Libbi; 1993 World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef; former al-Qaeda in Iraq commander Khaled al- Mashhadani; and 1998 U.S. embassy bomber Khalfan Khamis Mohamed. 'These terrorists are the absolute cream of the crop, I can assure you,' Lute said. 'No one else in American custody terrifies us more than these horrible, violent men.' Prior to their release, the terrorists were reportedly deprived of sleep, starved, and tortured in hopes of raising their anger levels and provoking them to coordinate a strike suitable for challenging the nation's readiness, response, and recovery efforts. DHS spokesman Roger Munns said there was no reason for concern, since all the terrorists would most likely be apprehended during routine traffic stops well before they conspired to attack national defense utilities or used weapons of mass destruction to murder millions of innocent Americans. 'Some of them will certainly attempt to infiltrate some of our more vulnerable nuclear power plants in Texas or North Carolina, but the odds of them succeeding are pretty low, if you think about it,' Munns said. 'Although, off the record, I really hope they don't go after Chicago's mass transit system, because, let me tell you, that whole thing would go up in flames real quick.' NORAD Commander James A. Winnefeld, Jr. assured reporters that adequate security measures were in place to protect the American public and the plan would not fail as it did during the botched Sept. 11, 2001 security preparedness exercise. 'In our defense, we really didn't think it would be possible for them to hit both towers,' Winnefeld said. 'But with hindsight, I guess it's clear that we gave those guys way too much money and training.' ",0
"By the end of â€œFences,â€ we will have learned a lot about Troy Maxson â€” about his hard Southern childhood, his time in prison and the Negro Leagues, his work ethic, his sexual appetites and his parenting philosophy â€” but the first and most important thing we know about the man is that he is one of the worldâ€™s great talkers. He enters the screen on a tide of verbiage, jawing with his friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and bantering with his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). The audience quickly grasps what Rose and Bono have known for years. Troy is by turns funny, provocative, inspiring and hurtful, but one thing he will never be as long as he draws breath is silent.There is plenty of brag and bluster in his speech, as well as flecks of profanity and poetry. He tells tales and busts chops with unflagging energy, at times testing the patience of Rose, Bono and his other friends and relations. But mostly Troy, who makes no secret of his illiteracy, uses language as a tool of analysis, a way of explaining whatâ€™s on his mind and figuring out the shape of the world he must inhabit.Language is also, in another sense, Troyâ€™s very substance. He came into being as words on the page, words assembled and given life by the playwright August Wilson. Embodied onstage first by James Earl Jones in the original 1985 production of â€œFencesâ€ and more recently by Denzel Washington in the 2010 Broadway revival, Troy is one of the indelible characters in American dramatic literature, equal to â€” and in some ways a pointed response to â€” Arthur Millerâ€™s Willy Loman.Mr. Washington, reprising the role in this fine film adaptation, which he also directed, is a pretty good talker in his own right. His voice is a mighty instrument, and if you closed your eyes and just listened to â€œFencesâ€ you would hear a verbal performance of unmatched force and nuance. More than one, in fact. Ms. Davis, who also starred in that 2010 revival, has fewer lines, but as the story of their marriage unfolds, the center of gravity shifts quietly and inexorably in her direction. Roseâ€™s plain-spokenness is the necessary counterweight to her husbandâ€™s grandiloquence.But even as it properly foregrounds Wilsonâ€™s dialogue â€” few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry â€” â€œFencesâ€ is much more than a filmed reading. Mr. Washington has wisely resisted the temptation to force a lot of unnecessary cinema on the play. The action ventures beyond Troy and Roseâ€™s yard â€” into their house and onto the street, mostly â€” to give them a bit more room to move and the audience a little more to look at. Confinement, however, is a theme implied in the playâ€™s title, and opening it up too much would risk diluting the power of watching large personalities colliding in a narrow place.If the sound were to suddenly fail â€” or if the dialogue were dubbed into Martian â€” the impact of the performances would still be palpable. The stories Troy and Rose tell about their lives up until this point are inscribed in their bodies. There is tenderness in the way they approach each other, and an undertow of fatigue as well. In middle age, with a teenage son named Cory (Jovan Adepo), they have settled into habits that are evident in their posture and their gestures. Troy, 53 years old and employed as a sanitation worker, has the coiled strength and physical assurance of the athlete he used to be. He has probably lost some speed on the basepaths, but when he says he could knock a fastball out of the park you believe him.Itâ€™s 1957, though, and time has betrayed him. When in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color line, it was too late for Troy, and his bitterness infects his relationship with Cory, who is being scouted for college football scholarships. Troyâ€™s other son, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), is a musician, and the dynamic among the three of them is one of the ways â€œFencesâ€ echoes â€œDeath of a Salesman.â€ Troyâ€™s betrayal of Rose is another.To say that the difference between Willy and Troy is racial is to state the obvious and also to risk understating Wilsonâ€™s achievement. â€œFencesâ€ is part of a cycle of 10 plays about the African-American experience that amounts to a critique of the American dream from the standpoint of people intent on defying their exclusion from it. If Willy Lomanâ€™s tragedy proceeds from disillusionment, Troyâ€™s redemption is possible because he never had any illusions to begin with. His rigid ideas about work, responsibility and manhood constitute not a demand for attention, but an assertion of dignity. His cruelty, selfishness and shortsightedness are somehow inseparable from his loyalty, his steadfastness and his existential courage.Rose knows all of this, and helps the audience to see it. As incarnated by Ms. Davis, she is more than a foil and a helpmate. Her relative reticence makes her not just the filmâ€™s conscience, but also its central mystery. It falls to Rose to solve the problems her husband has created, to smooth over his relationships with his sons and his brother, Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), a brain-damaged veteran of World War II. She also struggles with a challenge analogous to the one Troy faces, one made more complicated by his role in maintaining it.â€œWhat about my life?â€ she asks him in the midst of an especially wrenching confrontation. What is most remarkable about this film is how thoroughly â€” how painfully, how honestly, how beautifully â€” it answers that question.",1
"Black Confederate Flag Supporter Murdered, And Heres Why Obama Doesnt Want You To Know 49-year-old Anthony Hervey of Oxford, Mississippi was best known for being a supporter of the Confederate flag, publishing a book entitled: Why I Wave the Confederate Flag, Written by a Black Man. Hervey was tragically killed this past Saturday in a road dispute. Arlene Barnum, the passenger in his car, survived. Of course, weve heard nothing about this in the news. Just one day prior to his death, Hervey and Barnum spoke at an event in support of a Confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama. According to Barnum, Hervey was wearing a Confederate military hat on the ride home. They stopped in a convenience store, and shortly thereafter the confrontation took place on the highway. I could have sworn that they knew him because of his reaction to them, Barnum told the AP. Just before the incident, Hervey sped up to avoid the car, which was full of five black men. Barnum told reporters that the vehicle swerved toward them but didnt make contact. Nevertheless, their car was forced to leave the roadway. The Explorer reportedly left the roadway and continued down into the median south of US278, reentering US278 and crossing both westbound lanes before continuing off the right shoulder of US278. Ultimately, the Explorer collided with an embankment and concrete ditch, rolling several times. Hervey was pronounced dead at the scene. What do you think of the incident? Was this no accident? Should the media be reporting on this? ",0
"Local 88-year-old widower Willard Baskin announced his interest Wednesday in the dollfaced, sclerotic little number who lives down the hall from him at the Sunshine Valley Continuing Care Center. Oh, man, watching that hot item shuffle it oh-so-slowly across the common area has been driving me wild, the retired tool-and-die maker said of the liver-spotted cutie he has reportedly had his eye on each evening during activity time. That lingering mothball scent, the way she gums the rice pudding from her spoonits enough to quicken the pulse of any man around here who still has one. And I cant see that sexy, L-shape body without starting to daydream that maybe shes suffered just enough dementia to have forgotten all her old inhibitions. Baskin added that, unfortunately, the hunched-over vixen acts as if she doesnt know he exists, which he grants is certainly a possibility. ",0
"17 Signs That A Full-Blown Economic Depression Is Raging In Southern Europe Is The U.S. Next?selfnews Post Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal all tried to just slow down the rate at which their government debts were increasing, and look at what happened to their economies. In each case, GDP is shrinking, unemployment is skyrocketing, credit is freezing up and manufacturing is declining. And you know what? None of those countries has even gotten close to a balanced budget yet. They are all still going into even more debt. Just imagine what would happen if they actually tried to only spend the money that they brought in? I have always said that the next wave of the economic collapse would start in Europe and that is exactly what is happening. So keep watchingEurope. What is happening to them will eventually happen to us. The following are 17 signs that a full-blown economic depression is raging in southern Europe #1 The Italian economy is in the midst of a horrifying credit crunch that is causing thousands of companies to go bankrupt Confindustria, the business federation, said 29pc of Italian firms cannot meet operational expenses and are starved of liquidity. A third phase of the credit crunch is underway that matches the shocks in 2008-2009 and again in 2011. In a research report the group said the economy was caught in a vicious circle where banks are too frightened to lend, driving more companies over the edge. A thousand are going bankrupt every day. #3 During the 4th quarter of 2012, the youth unemployment rate in Greece was 57.8 percent. #4 The unemployment rate in Spain has reached 26 percent. #5 In Spain there are 107 unemployed workers for every available job. #6 The unemployment rate in Italy is now 11.7 percent. That is the highest that it has been since Italy joined the euro. #7 The youth unemployment rate in Italy has risen to a new all-time record high of 38.7 percent. #8 Unemployment in the eurozone as a whole has reached a new all-time high of 11.9 percent. #9 Italys economy is starting to shrink at a frightening pace Data from Italys national statistics institute ISTAT showed that the countrys economy shrank by 0.9pc in the fourth quarter of last year and gross domestic product was down a revised 2.8pc year-on-year. #10 The Greek economy is contracting even faster than the Italian economy is Greece also sank further into recession during the fourth quarter of 2012, with figures on Monday showing the economy contracted by 5.7pc year-on-year. #11 Overall, the Greek economy has contracted by more than 20 percent since 2008. #12 Manufacturing activity is declining just about everywhere in Europeexcept for Germany Research group Markit said its index of activity in UK manufacturing where 50 is the cut off between growth and decline sank from 50.5 in January to 47.9 in February. It left Britain on the brink of a third recession in five years after the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: This represents a major setback to hopes that the UK economy can return to growth in the first quarter and avoid a triple-dip recession. The eurozone manufacturing index also read 47.9. Germany scored 50.3 but Spain hit 46.8, Italy 45.8 and France 43.9. #13 The percentage of bad loans in Italian banks has risen to 12.2 percent. Back in 2007, that number was sitting at just 4.5 percent. #14 Bank deposits experienced significant declines all over Europeduring the month of January. #15 Private bond default rates are soaring all over southern Europe SP said the default rate for Italian non-investment grade bonds jumped to 9.5pc last year from 5.7pc in 2012 as local banks shut off funding. It was even worse in Spain, doubling to 14.3pc. The default rate in France rocketed from 0.8pc to 8.7pc, the latest in a blizzard of bad news from the country as the delayed effects of tax rises, fiscal tightening, and the strong euro do their worst. #16 Lars Feld, a key economic adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, recently said the following The sustainability of Italian public finances is in jeopardy. The euro crisis will therefore return shortly with a vengeance. #17 Things have gotten so bad in Greece that the Greek government plans to sell off 28 state-owned buildings including the main police headquarters in Athens. One of the few politicians in Europe that actually understands what is happening in Europe is Nigel Farage. A video of one of his recent rants is posted below. Farage believes that the Eurozone has been a complete economic disaster and that the worst is yet to come Most people believe that the eurozone has been saved, but that is not even close to the truth. In fact, it becomes more likely that we will see the eurozone break up with each passing day. So who would leave first? Well, recently there have been rumblings among some German politicians that Greece should be the first to leave. The following is from a recent Reuters article Greece remains the biggest risk for the euro zone despite a calming of its economic and political crisis and may still have to leave the common currency, a senior conservative ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. But there is also a chance that Germany could eventually be the first nation that decides to leave the euro. In fact, a new political party is forming in Germany that is committed to getting Germany out of the euro. The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard A new party led by economists, jurists, and Christian Democrat rebels will kick off this week, calling for the break-up of monetary union before it can do any more damage. An end to this euro, is the first line on the webpage of Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD). The introduction of the euro has proved to be a fatal mistake, that threatens the welfare of us all. The old parties are used up. They stubbornly refuse to admit their mistakes. They propose German withdrawl from EMU and return to the D-Mark, or a breakaway currency with the Dutch, Austrians, Finns, and like-minded nations. The French are not among them. The borders run along the ancient line of cleavage dividing Latins from Germanic tribes. However this all plays out, the reality is that things are about to get much more interesting in Europe. No debt bubble lasts forever. The Europeans are finding that out right now, and the U.S. wont be too far behind. But for the moment, most Americans assume that everything is going to be okay because the Dow keeps setting new all-time record highs. Well, enjoy this little bubble of debt-fueled false prosperity while you can, because it wont last for long. A massive wake-up call is coming, and it will be exceedingly painful for those that are not ready for it. This article first appeared here at the Economic Collapse Blog.

"In response to a question on unemployment asked during tonights town-hall-style debate, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney shared a touching and poignant lie about meeting a struggling single mother of four on the campaign trail. Just the other day I was in Richmond, VA, and a young woman named Sarah walked up to me and told me she had just lost her job and was finding it harder and harder to put food on the table for her kids, Romney said of the woman he has never actually met because she does not exist. She said to me, Mitt, I just cant survive another four years of high taxes and out-of-control government spending under President Obama. Well, Sarah, if youre watching tonight, I want you to know that under my watch, we will reduce the tax burden on Americans, bring back jobs, and make sure everyone has a chance to be successful. Sources confirmed the debate audience was also moved by another completely fabricated story in which Romney spoke of an elderly woman in Ohio who isnt real and who tearfully explained that she just wants to make her own choices about health care.

"25 Facts About The Fall Of Detroit That Will Leave You Shaking Your HeadMichael Snyder On Thursday, we learned that the decision had been made for the city of Detroit to formally file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. It was going to be the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States by far, but on Friday it was stopped at least temporarily by an Ingham County judge. She ruled that Detroits bankruptcy filingviolates the Michigan Constitution because it would result in reduced pension payments for retired workers. She also stated that Detroits bankruptcy filing was also not honoring the (United States) president, who took (Detroits auto companies) out of bankruptcy, and she ordered that a copy of her judgment be sent to Barack Obama. How honoring the president has anything to do with the bankruptcy of Detroit is a bit of a mystery, but what that judge has done is ensured that there will be months of legal wrangling ahead over Detroits money woes. It will be very interesting to see how all of this plays out. But one thing is for sure the city of Detroit is flat broke. One of the greatest cities in the history of the world is just a shell of its former self. The following are 25 facts about the fall of Detroit that will leave you shaking your head 1) At this point, the city of Detroit owes money to more than 100,000 creditors. 2) Detroit is facing $20 billion in debt and unfunded liabilities. That breaks down to more than $25,000 per resident. 3) Back in 1960, the city of Detroit actually had the highest per-capita income in the entire nation. 5) Between December 2000 and December 2010, 48 percent of the manufacturing jobs in the state of Michigan were lost. 6) There are lots of houses available for sale in Detroit right now for $500 or less. 7) At this point, there are approximately 78,000 abandoned homes in the city. 8) About one-third of Detroits 140 square miles is either vacant or derelict. 9) An astounding 47 percent of the residents of the city of Detroit are functionally illiterate. 10) Less than half of the residents of Detroit over the age of 16 are working at this point. 11) If you can believe it, 60 percent of all children in the city of Detroit are living in poverty. 12) Detroit was once the fourth-largest city in the United States, but over the past 60 years the population of Detroit has fallen by 63 percent. 13) The city of Detroit is now very heavily dependent on the tax revenue it pulls in from the casinos in the city. Right now, Detroit is bringing in about 11 million dollars a month in tax revenue from the casinos. 14) There are 70 Superfund hazardous waste sites in Detroit. 15) 40 percent of the street lights do not work. 16) Only about a third of the ambulances are running. 17) Some ambulances in the city of Detroit have been used for so long that they have more than 250,000 miles on them. 18) Two-thirds of the parks in the city of Detroit have been permanently closed down since 2008. 19) The size of the police force in Detroit has been cut by about 40 percent over the past decade. 20) When you call the police in Detroit, it takes them an average of 58 minutes to respond. 21) Due to budget cutbacks, most police stations in Detroit are now closed to the public for 16 hours a day. 22) The violent crime rate in Detroit is five times higher than the national average. 23) The murder rate in Detroit is 11 times higher than it is in New York City. 24) Today, police solve less than 10 percent of the crimes that are committed in Detroit. 25) Crime has gotten so bad in Detroit that even the police are telling people to enter Detroit at your own risk. It is easy to point fingers and mock Detroit, but the truth is that the rest of America is going down the exact same path that Detroit has gone down. Detroit just got there first. All over this country, there are hundreds of state and local governmentsthat are also on the verge of financial ruin Everyone will say, Oh well, its Detroit. I thought it was already in bankruptcy, said Michigan State University economist Eric Scorsone. But Detroit is not unique. Its the same in Chicago and New York and San Diego and San Jose. Its a lot of major cities in this country. They may not be as extreme as Detroit, but a lot of them face the same problems. A while back, Meredith Whitney was highly criticized for predicting that there would be a huge wave of municipal defaults in this country. When it didnt happen, the critics let her have it mercilessly. She was just early. Detroit is only just the beginning. When the next major financial crisis strikes, we are going to see a wave of municipal bankruptcies unlike anything we have ever seen before. And of course the biggest debt problem of all in this country is the U.S. government. We are going to pay a great price for piling up nearly 17 trillion dollars of debt and over 200 trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities. All over the nation, our economic infrastructure is being gutted, debt levels are exploding and poverty is spreading. We are consuming far more wealth than we are producing, and our share of global GDP has been declining dramatically. We have been living way above our means for so long that we think it is normal, but an extremely painful adjustment is coming and most Americans are not going to know how to handle it. So dont laugh at Detroit. The economic pain that Detroit is experiencing will be coming to your area of the country soon enough. This article first appeared here at the Economic Collapse Blog.

"Some of the starlings that dance around Brighton Pier at dusk spend their days on the rooftops above my garden. They whoop and whistle atop television aerials and chimney stacks, fly about a bit. Then, a couple of hours before sunset, they become noisier. They seem to call to each other, egg each other on like friends texting before a night out. Impatiently, little groups fly from TV aerial to TV aerial, one or two slowly building up to six or seven. The whistles and clicks become louder, the flights become bolder; swifter somehow, as more join and the momentum builds, as they impatiently wait to get going. Then, suddenly, theyâ€™re gone - whoosh - to the Pier. Each little gang from Brighton and Hoveâ€™s many rooftops and TV aerials, joining together for the big dance in the sky. If you walk along the beach before sunset you can see them on their way. Their dark bodies bounce like charged telecom wires, shadowing across seafront buildings in the fading light. On the journey of two miles or so, the starlings join together, meeting other gangs from other rooftops. Once, on my birthday, I was treated to a night in The Grand Hotel, made famous for the bombing during the Conservative Party conference in 1984; on the fifth floor our balcony was starling height, and we watched, champagne in hand, with the sun setting over The West Pier, as groups of 10 or 20 or 200 dashed to the party from all directions, calling and heckling to each other as they flew. Finally they came together in flocks of several thousand, moving through the sky in tremendous synchronised ribbons, contracting and expanding as one, a bigger more majestic being, a heartbeat pulsing above the city. If you stand on the Pier and shut out the noise of arcade games, you can hear the starlings whoosh past you, a million wings beating in symmetry like wind rustling the trees. Stand close enough and you feel the stormy blast generated by their bodies on your face. They roost in the bowels of the Pier, beneath your feet. They never shut up, chatting and clicking as they rest, while their friends keep on going, refusing to let go of the night.     UK starling numbers have declined by 66% since the 1970s. Photograph: Alamy   This thing they do, this dancing, is called murmuration. And Brighton Pier is one of the best places in the country to see it. No one really knows what it is or why they do it (other birds donâ€™t). Some scientists believe they do it to gain safety in numbers; to confuse predators before settling down to roost. Others think they gather to keep warm or exchange information. I donâ€™t care why they do it - Iâ€™m just glad they do. Iâ€™ve seen only three starlings in my garden. One was a baby and the other two its parents, teaching their young one to use the feeder. The three of them arrived with a gang of (slightly put out) house sparrows. I sat a couple of metres away in my deckchair, a cushion on my head serving as a hat to shield my eyes and laptop from the sun â€“ it was enough to fool the birds into believing I wasnâ€™t there. I watched as the baby clumsily grappled with the feeder, wings flapping, house sparrows tutting, parents on the fence looking the other way. Then the baby fell off the feeder and the three of them flew away, never to be seen again.  Starlings, like almost everything else, are declining (66% since the 1970s). No one really knows why, although a lack of food and nesting habitat are the most likely reasons. In rural areas, the loss of permanent pasture and increase in the rearing of livestock is likely, but it urban areas it could be the loss of green space, the paving and fake-turfing of gardens. Starlings love to eat leatherjackets, the larvae of craneflies or daddy longlegs, which are considered a pest to many: they eat plant roots and can damage crops and make lawns look unsightly. Potent chemicals are used on the soil to remove them, which removes the food source for starlings and probably poisons everything else in the process. Elsewhere the soil is just locked away, like my garden was before I took up the decking. In my last garden I would watch female craneflies lay eggs in the lawn, their pointed ovipositors easily negotiating the hard turf, while blunt-ended males tumbled in the long grass. My Brighton lawn is barely three months old, but itâ€™s lush and green and shaggy around the edges. Iâ€™ve already planted clover in it and I hope other â€œweedsâ€ will seed into it in time. It will make a good home for leatherjackets, a good foraging ground for starlings. Anything to keep them dancing in the sky.

"NATO Members Drunkenly Sing We Are the World (Not Satire)By Joshua Krause I mean, theyre human just like the rest of us right? Surely they need to take a break from their murderous campaigns from time to time. Sometimes they just need to take a step back from it all, put their arms around each other and just sing, you know? While NATO foreign ministers met in Turkey earlier today, they did just that when they took a moment to open their black hearts and sing We Are The World, the nauseating benefit song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie in 1985.

"A plane carrying two sick workers rescued from a remote South Pole research station landed in Chile late on Wednesday after a daring effort that involved battling temperatures lower than minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit and round-the-clock darkness, the National Science Foundation said.The plane, a Twin Otter aircraft, left the foundationâ€™s Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station early on Wednesday morning and arrived in Punta Arenas, Chile, at 9:41 p.m., the foundation said on its Facebook page.The two patients will be taken for medical care that was not available at Amundsen-Scott, the foundation said. It would not reveal details of their conditions. Both patients are seasonal employees of Lockheed Martin Antarctic Support Contract, which offers operations and research support for the United States Antarctic Program, the foundation said.At the Magallanes Clinic in Punta Arenas, a nurse, Mauricio Seron, told The Associated Press that a woman â€œwith a gastric problemâ€ was the sicker of the two patients. Mr. Seron said the second patient was a man who had had a heart attack.The mission initially focused on evacuating one person, the foundation said, but to mitigate risks, it used the flight to take out a second person.Because of the extreme weather conditions, aircraft generally do not fly to the South Pole between February and October. (The plane used skis to land on the snow and ice there on Tuesday.)The South Pole is in the middle of its six-month night, when a lack of sunlight drives the frigid temperatures even lower. The temperatures at Amundsen-Scott were lower than minus 70 Fahrenheit in the past day.The rescue plane was operated by Kenn Borek Air of Canada, which has flown two similar rescue missions in 2001 and 2003, the National Science Foundation said in a statement.",1
"Enough of the secrets and rumours, the crass PR stunts, the fracas/non-fracas with an employee at Stuttgart airport; itâ€™s time for Messrs Clarkson, May and Hammond to show us what theyâ€™ve been up to. Come on then, what you got?  A lot of money, thatâ€™s abundantly clear from the opening sequence, shot in the California desert. But first weâ€™ve got to get out of rainy old Blighty. So Jeremy is leaving a building, handing his pass in ... got it, itâ€™s supposed to be the BBC. (A lot of this first episode seems to be aimed at his former employer â€“ if not quite winding the window down and giving a raised middle finger, then at least pulling up at the lights and looking over smugly: ha, check out my big budget.) Now heâ€™s at the airport, checking in, no fracases this time, he manages to catch the flight to Los Angeles, where he picks up his rental car â€“ a muscly Mustang. On the open road, finally free, heâ€™s joined by the other two, James and Hammond (sorry but I donâ€™t do first names with him) in similar cars; red, white and blue. Crossing the desert, they hook up with a Mad Max convoy of cars and trucks and bikes, heading to a stage where the Hothouse Flowers are playing I Can See Clearly Now (â€œGone are the dark clouds that had me blindâ€ â€“ another dig there). Itâ€™s like Burning Man; actually they call it Burning Van because there is one, plus a pirate ship, fire and a squadron of jets flying over. It is undeniably, gloriously cinematic, a brilliant beautiful spectacle.     At Burning Van festival â€¦ it could only be The Grand Tour. Photograph: Amazon Prime   Then they open their mouths, and suddenly itâ€™s same-old same-old. They introduce each other, and their tent, to the crowd. â€œWeâ€™re going to be like Gypsies,â€ says Jeremy, referring to the itinerant nature of The Grand Tour. â€œOnly the cars we drive are going to be insured.â€ Nought to racist in less than 10 minutes. (Heâ€™s already said heâ€™s not going to get fired â€œbecause weâ€™re on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse.â€ The other two look faintly embarrassed.)    Related: Burning petrol and cash, the Grand Tour begins   Inside the tent the audience are seated instead of standing, but thereâ€™s something familiar about it. And about the montage of what there is to look forward to. Cars of course, more stunts and big bangs: three midlife men messing about. Massively messing about now, because of that Amazon budget. Thereâ€™s some banter with the American audience â€“ you say tomato, I say gearstick, that sort of thing. And between the three of them: James is a slow driver, ho ho; Hammond is less tall than the others, lol; we got fired, tee hee. Then they have an extended head to head to head between three supercars: a McLaren P1, a Porsche 918 and a Ferrari LaFerrari (or a Ferarri TheFerrari as James calls it, quite amusingly). Itâ€™s a very extended test, in two parts. This opening episode is certainly putting down a marker that says this is a serious motoring show, and theyâ€™re serious car journalists, not â€“ say â€“ former sitcom actors. And it will appeal to the serious petrolhead.    You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same â€¦ The Grand Tour. Photograph: Roderick Fountain/Amazon Prime   There is a new track, the same shape as the Ebola virus â€“ itâ€™s known as the Eboladrome â€“ with an old ladyâ€™s house next to it (thereâ€™s going to be a rush to get the first interview isnâ€™t there?). Plus a new, unhelmeted test driver known as The American. Conversation Street, the new chat section, doesnâ€™t amount to much, and nor do the celebrities who are all killed off, hilariously, possibly because they â€“ US actors Jeremy Renner and Armie Hammer, and Carol Vorderman â€“ arenâ€™t the huge names theyâ€™d hoped for.      Clarkson, May and Hammond reunite for The Grand Tour - video trailer  In the detail, in the format, The Grand Tour is different: there are loads of new ideas here â€“ there had to be, or the BBC legal eagles would swoop. And yet itâ€™s all utterly familiar. Because more than format, more even than the amount of money you throw at something, what really gives a television show its personality is the personnel. You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same. And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May. Fans of old Top Gear are going to be happy. â€¢ Episode one of The Grand Tour is available now on Amazon Prime, with a new episode every Friday. ",1
"BREAKING: Trump Announces What No One Ever Expected About His Inauguration According to recent reports, Donald Trump has just made a monumental announcement about his inaugurationboth the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, and Protestant evangelist Franklin Graham have agreed to read scriptures at the event. Dolans involvement is particularly surprising, given that he frequently spoke out against Trumps comments about Syrian refugees during his campaign. Now, Dolan has expressed his excitement to be reading a prayer at the event. I am honored to have been asked to offer a reading from Scripture at the upcoming presidential inauguration, and look forward to asking Almighty God to inspire and guide our new president and to continue to bless our great nation, he commented. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and Pastor Paula White will also give readings. Rabbi Marvin Heri and Bishop Wayne Jackson will also speak. Since the first inaugural ceremony, our leaders have paid tribute to the blessings of liberty that have been bestowed upon our country and its people, Tom Barrack, head of the Inaugural Committee, said in a statement. I am pleased to announce that a diverse set of faith leaders will offer readings and prayers at the swearing-in of President-elect Trump and honor the vital role religious faith plays in our multicultural, vibrant nation. What do you think? Is this just another sign that Trump will be incorporating Christian traditions into his presidency? ",0
"To the Editor:Re â€œThe Last Pension Dominoâ€ (Business Day, March 4):It is deeply troubling that the Tennessee Valley Authorityâ€™s chief executive, William D. Johnson, is declaring war on his employeesâ€™ retirement savings while he takes home the highest compensation of any federal employee in the country ($6.4 million, according to your article).The T.V.A. is a publicly funded institution, doling out multimillion-dollar paychecks to its executives and putting hardworking peopleâ€™s pensions at risk. The T.V.A. should be focused on providing efficient public services while taking care of all of its employees.Perhaps most upsetting is the fact that while pension benefits to rank-and-file members will be slashed under Mr. Johnsonâ€™s proposal, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that allows him to rake in thousands of extra dollars per year wonâ€™t be touched.A strong public pension system offers greater security for workers by pooling assets and risks between the employer and the employee. This ensures that workers will receive their promised benefits. Meanwhile, 401(k)-style accounts can leave hardworking people with little to no savings upon retirement if their investments do poorly.Mr. Johnson is pushing a proposal that will leave retirees high and dry and taxpayersâ€™ dollars on the line. In the end, our economy does better when Americans know that they can trust the government to follow through on its promises and allow them to retire with dignity.BAILEY CHILDERSExecutive DirectorNational Public Pension CoalitionWashington",1

Canadians Vote For 4 More Years of OligarchyBy James Corbett ,0
"ISTANBUL â€” Turkey said on Wednesday that it would empty its prisons of tens of thousands of criminals to make room for the wave of journalists, teachers, lawyers and judges rounded up in connection with last monthâ€™s failed coup.The startling decision to put so many criminals convicted of nonviolent offenses back on the streets is a measure of the strains on the state as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expands a wide-ranging purge of those suspected of being enemies of the government. The efforts have created gaping holes in government institutions, the judiciary, schools, the news media and countless other professions.Acting under powers granted by a state of emergency and allowing the state to bypass Parliament to enact new laws, Turkey said in a decree issued on Wednesday that it would begin releasing up to 38,000 prisoners, or roughly one in five people behind bars. Most will be freed by the end of the week.The government has blamed the coup attempt, which unfolded the night of July 15 as a rebel faction of the military sought to topple the government, on Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who lives in self-exile in rural Pennsylvania and whose followers have long filled positions in state institutions, including the military. But the state has gone well beyond arresting only the military officers suspected of planning the coup attempt.Prisons filled to capacity in the weeks after the coup attempt, and many detainees slept in the communal spaces of jails, often without any bedding, said Ozturk Turkdogan, the president of the Human Rights Association in Turkey. The authorities have also used sports arenas to house the flood of prisoners.â€œThis is a serious case of bad treatment, and the prisoners are suffering from serious health concerns as a result,â€ Mr. Turkdogan said.More than 40,000 people have been detained or arrested on coup-related charges, officials say. Tens of thousands of others, including teachers, police officers, state bureaucrats and even airline employees, have lost their jobs. In some cases, the state has seized assets without due process, activists say.â€œThere are a lot of arbitrary practices,â€ said Andrew Gardner, a researcher on Turkey for Amnesty International.Under the prisoner-release plan, convicted criminals who have served at least half of their sentences will be freed on supervised parole. The government said that those guilty of murder, rape or other violent crimes were not eligible for release.â€œThe conditions of prisons were already bad before the coup attempt because they were over capacity,â€ said Sezgin Tanrikulu, a lawmaker with the main secular opposition group, the Republican Peopleâ€™s Party. Now, he said, â€œWe have heard reports of two to three people sharing beds and having to sleep in corridors.â€Mr. Tanrikulu said his party supported the prisoner-release program as a necessary measure to reduce overcrowding, but he added that it should have been done in consultation with Parliament. â€œIt is not right to use the state of emergency to subvert the rule of law in Turkey,â€ he said.Rights activists have raised concerns that the government is making no distinction between those who committed criminal acts to support the coup and people who might only have donated money to charities linked to Mr. Gulen, held accounts at banks affiliated with him or attended schools associated with the cleric.At the same time, Mr. Erdoganâ€™s government has accelerated an already widespread crackdown on freedom of expression, shutting down more than 100 news outlets suspected of holding links to Mr. Gulen and arresting dozens of journalists.Since the failed coup, Turkey has once again become the worldâ€™s leading jailer of journalists, a position the country held a few years ago, according to Reporters Without Borders, an international advocacy group.â€œItâ€™s very unfortunate,â€ said Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a columnist and human rights lawyer who was detained briefly after the coup attempt, referring to the prisoner releases. He said the government would release â€œthieves, all the criminals, to fill the prisons with intellectuals, writers, human rights activists and others, as well as the coup people.â€The scale of the purges has raised concern in the West that Turkey is backsliding on human rights, after having shown improvement on that front as it sought membership in the European Union.Amnesty International recently published a report accusing Turkish security forces of beating and torturing imprisoned coup suspects. Separately, photos of prisoners, many of them bruised or with black eyes, have circulated on social media. Turkish officials have denied all reports of torture or other abuses.At the same time, Turkey has curtailed the rights of prisoners, raising fears that the purges are being conducted beyond the rule of law, and that the accused will be unable to adequately defend themselves.A decree issued under the state of emergency restricts visits by lawyers and family members. The state now has the right to record conversations between prisoners and their lawyers, and in some cases government officials are present for those discussions.â€œThis leads to censorship because people fear repercussions, especially in the cases of reporting torture and mistreatment,â€ said Mr. Turkdogan, of the Human Rights Association. â€œThey canâ€™t share confidential information about their case. Under these conditions, how can anyone defend themselves? Even those that are guilty have a right to defend themselves.â€",1
"My wife and I flew to Austria for a weekâ€™s winter walking in February. We had to fly back to the UK on the advice of hospital staff, as my wifeâ€™s aunt had been taken seriously ill. My wife was her auntâ€™s official next of kin and unofficial carer. She died before we arrived home. We contacted our travel insurance company, Axa, from Austria and were assured that we could make a claim. We sent the form and a medical report from the auntâ€™s GP and Axa informed us by phone that the claim had been approved.  Days later we received another call from Axa, telling us that a mistake had been made and the claim was no longer approved because an aunt does not qualify as a â€œclose relativeâ€. I wrote to protest and received a further call from Axa, advising that an independent underwriter had agreed that, in the circumstances, the aunt could be deemed to be a â€œclose relativeâ€. There was then a further delay before we received a letter from Axa, once again disallowing the claim, this time on medical grounds. We appealed and heard nothing, in spite of two further reminder letters. I asked for a copy of the companyâ€™s complaints procedure and was told that my letters had not been replied to as Axa â€œconsidered the case closedâ€. That was last month. Since then, we have heard nothing. It appears to us we are being ignored. MW, Hexham, Northumberland Insurance companies are notorious for wriggling out of claims but few duck and weave as shamelessly as this. Axa is disinclined to explain how it plumbed such depths of customer service. It merely blames, primly, â€œsome confusion around the circumstancesâ€ of your claim which led to â€œa level of communication below Axaâ€™s usual standardsâ€. Apparently, the call handlers have been hauled in or, rather, in Axaâ€™s words, â€œgiven the necessary guidanceâ€ to ensure your plight is not repeated. Within hours of my contacting the press office you were told that your claim would be settled in full with the excess waived as a goodwill gesture. And youâ€™ve finally been sent the complaints procedure with the assurance that the global travel complaints manager will handle your case personally. So it would be a happy ending, save for the sneaky feeling that if Axa hadnâ€™t run scared of a headline, your laments would still echo through emptiness.

"Taking the temperature of the Department of Consumer Affairs -- Diagnosis: DeadlyJanet C. Phelan The two records requests in question, one made to the PFB in January of 2012 and the other made in April of 2012, produced email responses which were highly problematic. The proper format to respond to a public records act request is by letter, as emails may not be considered legal tender. In fact, if there were a legal challenge to the content of the responses, the emails might not be admissable in a court of law. In an email dated January 27, 2012, DCA Press Officer Russ Heimerich replied to a public records act request for the policies and procedures manual in use by the PFB, admitting there were no such written records. Clearly, for a government agency to be operating in a vacuum of written guidelines is unheard of. The terminology used for such an absence of written procedures is underground guidelines, which, according to attorney Bruce Ebert, are simply illegal. The request was made due to the mounting evidence that the PFB has gone rogue. Top of the list of concerns is the fact that the agency is closing complaints with no legal basis to do so. The tiny PFB, staffed by only one analyst, Angela Bigelow, and a part-time bureau chief, Gil DeLuna, serves the critical function of overseeing and licensing professional conservators and fiduciaries. The complaints which have been closed by the Bureau include allegations of theft, embezzlement and profound physical and medical abuse. A number of the complaints have alleged that the abuse of the elderly or disabled person resulted in death. Queries made as to the reason for complaint closure have met with silence. Guardianship abuse is admittedly a hot button item. The abuses being committed against these vulnerable citizens has reached a critical point, and grassroots groups have sprung up across the country in an effort to address this. selfnewss, such as Bonnie Reiter and Dr. Robert Sarhan, each of whom allege that a conservator caused the untimely death of a parent, have visited D.C., met with Congressmen, written letters to the media, made reports to the FBI, all with no ostensible results. Another public records request tendered in April asked for interagency memos advising the Bureau that they would be protected for failing to investigate or prosecute claims of conservator crimes. PFB Chief Gil Deluna repliedvia email that there were no such records. DeLuna was repeatedly contacted asking if he would put his reply in the form of a letter and has not replied. The record of the DCA in prosecuting complaints speaks for itself. The most recent available annual report for 2010 lists, under the Conviction/Arrest notification category, that there were zero arrests made, zero pending and zero referred for investigation. Zero inspections were conducted and zero citations were issued. There were zero referrals for criminal action made and zero for civil. The report states that, in terms of cost recovery to complainants, zero dollars had been ordered and zero dollars had been collected. In a conversation several months ago, DCA Deputy Director Reichel Everhart sounded shocked to learn that the PFB had no written guidelines. She promised to speak with PFB Chief DeLuna and get back to this reporter promptly. Since then, Everhart has been unavailable for comment and has not fulfilled her promise. The Bureau appears to be operating under a cloak of secrecy and provides little transparency as to its functioning. Issues of concern include that agencys negligence in advising complainants that their complaints were closed. Several complainants, including Joe Quattrochi and Gina Rilke, were surprised to learn that their complaints were closed over a year ago as they were never so informed. Nor will the agency provide the file of the complaint, including any scrap of work product, to the complainant upon request. Its all hush-hush. The Professional Fiduciaries Bureau was created by an act of the Legislature in 2006, following an investigative series into conservatorship abuse, published in the Los Angeles Times. The abuses detailed in the series, Guardians for ProfitWhen a Family Matter becomes a Business, produced a public outcry and the Legislature swung into action, passing the Omnibus Conservatorship Reform Act of 2006.The Bureaus funding was subsequently line item vetoed for two years in a row by Governor Schwarzenegger, and thus only opened its doors for business in late 2008. The Bureau is tasked with holding public meetings four times a year. Per its own website, there have been no public meetings in eight months, since October of last year. selfnewss and conservatorship abuse victims became interested in these public meetings and started to attend them last year. The meetings were then apparently discontinued. Former Assemblyman Dave Jones was a primary author of the legislation which created the Bureau. Jones, now California Insurance Commissioner, has declined to reply to questions as to what has happened to his brainchild. Speaking under conditions of anonymity, Jones staffer angrily suggested that such questions were inappropriate. Read other articles by Janet Phelan HERE.

"Fukushima Report: Interview With Dr. Richard WilcoxAs the real truth about Fukushima escapes Japan in spite of the black hole of media censorship there, increasing international pressure on Japan to confront the reality of this disaster mounts exponentially. Dr. Richard Wilcox and Hong Kong based science writer Yoichi Shimatsu traveled to Fukushima earlier this year. The 5th Estate: Dr. Wilcox, there appears to be a lack of national or local media coverage on Fukushima and the ongoing radiation leaks there. What is the situation regarding this in Tokyo at this point? Wilcox: Since the beginning of this man-made disaster, the media in Japan has covered it up, there has always been a time-lag between what is happening at the site and the reality versus the cover the government and TEPCO give it so this is not new. There has been non-stop leakage of substantial amounts of radiation into the Pacific, and the Japanese media has been under pressure from the government not to tell the truth on this. The nuclear industry in Japan has substantial influence over the media. At a conference of Japanese media about a year ago Japanese journalists said they would be fired from their publications if they reported the truth on Fukushima radiation fallout dangers. In reality it is a Japanese media blackout to a large extent. The 5th Estate: How are Tokyo residents reacting to this threat now? The 5th Estate: Are the Japanese people totally detached from reality? Wilcox: Of course the suffering people of Fukushima certainly are not. Just yesterday, TEPCO announced that they are spending millions to start yet another reactor while the Fukushima victims that are supposed to receive monetary assistance for relocation have not received anything. So TEPCO is now diverting money away from these victims whose lives have been arbitrarily destroyed, to a fruitless project to restart a reactor that will never transpire in any event given the situation at Fukushima now. TEPCOs credibility and its ability to deal with the situation has now completely collapsed. Even the Japanese NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) has denounced TEPCOs handling of the disaster. The 5th Estate: In your opinion is there any solution to the radiation leakage? Wilcox: First, there has to be transparency on the part of the Japanese government and TEPCO as to the scale and danger of the existing situation. They still have to invent the technology to address the problem, and to do that they have to assemble an international team of nuclear engineers to deal with this and get rid of all the politics and obfuscation that is part of the Japanese system and way of handling disasters of this nature and unprecedented scale. Its a Kabuki theatre of the absurd. The 5th Estate: What do you believe the catalyst will be that forces the Japanese government and TEPCO to face the facts and realize that they cannot continue to dump radioactive water into the Pacific? Will it take foreign military intervention? Wilcox: I do not believe it will come from Japanese domestic pressure, the people in this country are so traumatized, they are mentally and physically immobilized. It will have to come from abroad, and in what form is anyones guess. It could take a military reaction or threat from a neighboring country that is being irradiated and poisoned by Fukushima to finally convince the Japanese government that serious, concrete measures to contain the radiation must be implemented, and this is inexcusable and immoral on their part. For example the possibility of another big earthquake is always present and there is the rod storage pool above Unit Four and if that would collapse then that would most likely be an event that would force international intervention of some kind to halt the release of radiation into the atmosphere and Pacific Ocean.

"Over the last few years, buyers have been lured into the troubled housing market by two unusual opportunities: cash subsidies in the form of government tax credits, and rock-bottom prices on millions of foreclosed homes. The tax credits are now history. And the supply of foreclosed homes on the market is already falling as regulators, lawmakers and state law enforcement officials press to sharply reduce the number of foreclosures. Now, buyers and sellers are getting an early taste of what the real estate market might look like without those twin pillars of support: Sales of existing homes plunged 26 percent in October compared with the same period last year, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Tuesday. In some parts of the country, it was the worst October in at least 20 years, according to separate regional sales reports. Sales were down 41 percent in Minneapolis, 28 percent in Massachusetts and 34 percent in Illinois. In Portland, Ore., (down 39 percent) and Seattle (down 32 percent), it was the worst October since record-keeping began in 1994. In California, it was the second-worst October since at least 1988. 'People aren't buying houses -- period,' said Mark Fleming, an economist with CoreLogic, a data firm. Analysts had been predicting that winter chills would arrive early, although the numbers turned out to be a little worse than they had anticipated. Last fall, sales were robust as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was on the verge of ending. (Tax credits were later extended and expanded to include a broader range of buyers, expiring finally in April.) 'The factors that brought people into the market have either disappeared, in the case of the tax credit, or their impact is lessening, in the case of foreclosures,' said Jennifer H. Lee of BMO Capital Markets. 'I would certainly hope that housing can stand on its own two feet, but it will depend largely on the job market.' About 4.43 million homes were sold on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in October, compared with nearly 6 million in October 2009. In October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, about 5 million deals were signed. In July, the first month without the credit, sales hit a nadir of 3.84 million, the lowest level in 14 years. The tax credit inspired many people to accelerate planned purchases, just as administration economists intended. Meanwhile, the abundance of foreclosures offered millions of first-time buyers a chance to become owners. Misfortune for some yielded opportunities for others. Distressed sales, including foreclosures, have been about one-third of the market, while first-time buyers have been as much as 50 percent. Both are high by historic levels. If the supply of previously foreclosed homes continues to dry up, housing prices might stabilize or even rise. That would provide long-sought relief for sellers, but could keep many potential buyers out of the market and put sales in a permanent slump. Bill and Becky Britt just bought a house with five bedrooms, five baths and a five-car garage in the Denver suburb of Evergreen. The property was listed three years ago for $1.25 million. As recently as last February, the seller was trying to get $800,000. Then the property went into foreclosure. It was offered this fall by a bank for $600,000. The Britts paid $550,000. Such deals are disappearing, said the couple's agent, Marlene Maxon. 'More and more the banks are figuring out, let's get these sold without having to go through foreclosure,' she said. Short sales, where the sellers negotiate with their lender to sell their house and repay less than the full amount owed, are rising in popularity although they are still outnumbered by foreclosures. Bank of America Corp., for instance, said it had agreed to more than 60,000 short sales so far this year. If the Evergreen house had been a short sale, priced at perhaps $650,000, the Britts would not be moving in. 'Frankly, we would not and could not have paid what we believe the house is truly worth,' Britt, the president of Analytical Reference Materials International, wrote in an e-mail from Belgium, where he was working. Foreclosures have been under fire for about two months now. All 50 state attorneys general are conducting a joint investigation whose goal is nothing less than to change foreclosure in America. While many earlier programs tried and failed to curb the number of foreclosures, the uproar and outrage over shoddy documentation procedures at some lenders make success much more likely. Further ammunition came Tuesday in a highly critical interim report by an interagency federal task force examining the problem. Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, told the Financial Stability Oversight Council that the task force found 'widespread, and in our judgment, inexcusable breakdowns in basic controls.' The task force, formed earlier this fall, is composed of representatives from a range of government agencies with an interest in the financial system. Barr said that the mission of the task force includes 'providing alternatives to foreclosure, and acting in a coordinated and comprehensive way to hold the firms accountable, bring clarity and certainty and help households.' With the banks under pressure, they de-emphasized foreclosures in October. According to Lender Processing Services, a data company, the number of foreclosed homes that the banks prepared for sale during the month dropped by one-third, to 80,000. Whether this drop-off is temporary depends on the extent to which loan modifications and short sales ultimately supplant foreclosures. Even before the freezes, foreclosures were losing steam. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, for example, sales of previously foreclosed homes have fallen by one-third over the last year, while traditional sales were largely stable. 'The number of low-priced properties, of really good deals, is going to decline over the next few years,' said Pat Paulson, president-elect of the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. 'And as foreclosures fall, prices will go up.' In California, the sales of previously foreclosed houses dropped to 10,367 in October from 15,621 in October 2009 and 19,925 in October 2008, according to DataQuick, a real estate information company. A large part of the reason is that lenders simply are not bringing them to market. CoreLogic estimated this week that there is a 'shadow inventory' of more than 2 million delinquent and foreclosed homes that banks will ultimately have to dispose of. 'Some share of it surely will come to market,' said Fleming, the CoreLogic economist. 'How much is debatable.' ",1
"Almost 20 years ago, the great Chinese-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma embarked on a bold new direction in his career, to challenge himself musically and creatively, and question the monolithic classical canon.

"Seeking to step up enforcement of civil rights laws, the federal Department of Education says it will be sending letters in coming weeks to thousands of school districts and colleges, outlining their responsibilities on issues of fairness and equal opportunity. As part of that effort, the department intends to open investigations known as compliance reviews in about 32 school districts nationwide, seeking to verify that students of both sexes and all races are getting equal access to college preparatory curriculums and to advanced placement courses. The department plans to open similar civil rights investigations at half a dozen colleges. Education Secretary Arne Duncan is to announce the initiatives in a speech on Monday in Selma, Ala., where on March 7, 1965, hundreds of civil rights marchers were beaten by Alabama state troopers. Duncan plans to say that in the past decade the department's Office for Civil Rights 'has not been as vigilant as it should have been in combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities,' according to a text of the speech distributed to reporters on Sunday. It continues, 'We are going to reinvigorate civil rights enforcement.' The department enforces civil rights laws in schools and universities by responding to specific complaints from parents, students and others, but also by scrutinizing its own vast bodies of data on the nation's school and university systems, looking for signs of possible discrimination. A school seen to be expelling Hispanic students in numbers far out of proportion to their share of the student population, for instance, might become a candidate for compliance review, officials said. Russlyn H. Ali, assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said in an interview that the department would begin 38 compliance reviews before the current fiscal year ended on Oct. 1. That number compares with 29 such reviews carried out last year, 42 in 2008, 23 in 2007 and nine in 2006, she said. ",1
"The White House on Tuesday acknowledged Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the 'elected' president of Iran, but said it had no plans to congratulate the firebrand leader on his impending inauguration. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's swearing-in, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs stopped short of declaring him the 'legitimate' president following the political turmoil unleashed by his disputed reelection in June. 'He's the elected leader,' Gibbs said. Earlier, Gibbs was asked whether the United States would make any gesture of congratulations to mark the moment on Wednesday when Ahmadinejad takes the oath of office before parliament, military officials and some foreign diplomats. 'I don't have any reason to believe that we will send any letters,' Gibbs said. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and its interests in the country are represented by the Swiss embassy. Throughout the fierce political turmoil unleashed by Ahmadinejad's disputed reelection, the administration of President Barack Obama took pains not to inject the United States into the political tumult. But Obama became more critical of the Iranian government as the government launched a violent crackdown to suppress dissent and his administration expressed increasing questions about the conduct of the election. Ahmadinejad's victory set off the worst turmoil in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, with deadly street protests, political trials and increasing divisions among the ruling elite. About 30 people were killed in the violence, hundreds wounded and around 2,000 initially arrested, while 110 have gone on trial. ",1
"Many students have no trouble adapting to their new universityâ€™s culture. They don togas in freshersâ€™ week, assemble their ultimate squad by the end of year one, and make the most of the next few years until a cushy grad scheme picks them up at the end of it.  Others, however, will spend their first term fantasising about how great life would be anywhere other than the lonely fourth floor of their halls. In the past, unhappy students pretty much had to find a way to like it or lump it. But now the government is in the process of making it easier to switch university. The aim is to increase competition and encourage social mobility. Although the number of student making the change is currently low â€“ fewer than 7,000 students switched institution in 2013-14, out of about 400,000 UK undergraduates â€“ itâ€™s likely to increase. So if youâ€™re feeling like you just want out, hereâ€™s what you might want to consider first: Is it you or is it the uni? Some people have their heart set on going to a certain place. They love the city, theyâ€™ve planned their internships and they know exactly how theyâ€™re going to spend their weekends. But if you didnâ€™t get into your first-choice university, and you end up, reluctantly, at an unfamiliar campus in a faraway town, then life can feel unfair.    Related: Want to make a difference at university? Join the clubs   â€œI had a fine time â€“ met two of my closest friends â€“ but my heart was never in it,â€ says Charlotte Jones, who switched from Southampton to Queen Maryâ€™s in London at the end of her first year. â€œNot getting into my first-choice universities was really difficult â€“ it was my first real taste of disappointment, and I hadnâ€™t expected it. I think, in a way, it was immaturity that led me back to London. Southampton wasnâ€™t my first choice of uni and I couldnâ€™t accept the change of plans, or adapt to them.â€  Change can be expensive Itâ€™s important to be aware that there are financial implications to switching university. Manuel Souto-Otero, a senior lecturer in social sciences at Cardiff University who prepared a report in 2013 for the Higher Education Academy on credit transfer, says moving university can ending up costing you. â€œPeople may have established connections â€“ found a flat, got a job â€“ and these are additional costs. You will need to check with the student loans company and this is something you might have to take into account when making your decision.â€ Kirsty Bradbury, who moved from Bournemouth University to Southampton Solent at the end of her first year partly because of poor health, has experience of this. Although pleased she made the move, she says sorting her student finances was stressful and complicated. â€œI was originally given less funding because the course was deemed to be shorter, but I kept getting told different things by advisers,â€ she says. â€œThere need to be much clearer guidelines when it comes to changing courses.â€ Leaving can be awkward Sodâ€™s law dictates you will suddenly start to have a brilliant time once youâ€™ve decided to leave your university. And then thereâ€™s the decision of how exactly you tell your new friends. Do you backdoor it? Do you have one last big night out?  Jones says the process can be uncomfortable. â€œIt was an awkward situation where Iâ€™d ummâ€™d and ahâ€™d about leaving, and on a whim signed a contract for a second-year house with seven friends, so I had to pull out at the last minute and spend ages trying to find someone to fill my room,â€ she says. â€œMy friends in Southampton were all pissed off with me and didnâ€™t understand why I wanted to move. It was like an attack on them. They thought that I thought I was better than them.â€    Related: George the Poet's message to freshers   Try not to leave it late Making a snap decision is scary but wasting a year thinking â€œwhat ifâ€ is no good either. According to Souto-Otero, itâ€™s easier if people change very early on.  â€œIt can be done through Ucas if itâ€™s in the first days, but if it goes beyond that, it gets a little bit more difficult. You have to contact the new uni directly to see if they have a place available,â€ he says. â€œIt can be easier to change courses within your uni, rather than moving away.â€ You could trade up â€“ or down The idea that you can transfer to a more reputable university is something the government mentioned in the white paper, in order to help under-represented groups who are more likely to have landed up at a uni for which they are over-qualified.  Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation and a former director of strategy at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, expects switching between universities to become more common among those who do exceptionally well in first year.  â€œItâ€™s most likely to be young people who perhaps didnâ€™t get into their university of first choice right away, perhaps because their exam results werenâ€™t quite strong enough, or they didnâ€™t feel confident about doing well in a more competitive university. Perhaps their aspirations have risen, or career choices clarified, during their first year. This group of students will be looking to trade up.â€ Then there are those who are struggling, and might want to move in the opposite direction â€“ away from a selective university or a very demanding course. â€œSwitching courses, for this group, is a better alternative than dropping out of higher education entirely,â€ says Mian. Consider staying local If you donâ€™t want to uproot your life entirely then itâ€™s worth considering changing where you study but not where you live. Mian thinks that at the end of first year students are often settled. â€œThey have established friendships, perhaps got a job. Some might want to consider moving to a university in the same city or region rather than further afield,â€ he says.  Of course it is possible that leaving the area is exactly what you want - to reunite with schoolfriends, follow a partner to another university or just to make a fresh start. Will your work translate? The challenge in moving universities will be transferring credits for the courses you have already completed. However, if universities are actively recruiting switchers â€“ either to increase their numbers or to improve the diversity of their student body â€“ then itâ€™s likely they will make it easy for incoming students to bring credits with them.  â€œEither that, or they will ask them to take an additional course or two during second year to bring them up to the same base as existing students,â€ says Mian.  Whatever you choose, youâ€™re not a failure When you switch direction, you might feel judged by those who think you lack perseverance. â€œUni is seen as something you see through, and if you deviate it is something that hasnâ€™t gone according to plan,â€ says Souto-Otero. Donâ€™t let this hold you back. With the increase in tuition fees, the practice of switching courses is likely to become far more common, and thereâ€™s more reason than ever to put yourself first and make a decision that is right for you. For Jones, changing the plan wasnâ€™t easy but ultimately it was the right choice. â€œMy switch resulted in brilliant work experience and part-time jobs that were crucial for my career. And I made some really good friends â€“ in the end. But all these things took a while to realise and at the time it was awful, and lonely.â€ Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at@GdnStudents â€“ and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.",1
"The emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last weekâ€™s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesnâ€™t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.     â€˜We learned to fight backâ€™: Dreamers campaign against Donald Trump  Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someoneâ€™s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that peopleâ€™s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesnâ€™t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we donâ€™t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they arenâ€™t. With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty. The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement. Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillaryâ€™s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obamaâ€™s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery). The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to â€œlearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social actionâ€). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valleyâ€™s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be: â€œâ€¦ spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.â€ Attacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, â€œmadness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continueâ€. There are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words â€œDavosâ€ or â€œTahoeâ€. But it is when you search â€œVineyardâ€ on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By â€œvineyardâ€, of course, they mean Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve. Consider, for example, the 2015 email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that â€œHillaryâ€™s image is being torn apart in the media and thereâ€™s not enough effective push backâ€. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites Podesta to a dinner featuring â€œfood produced exclusively by the islandâ€™s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected winesâ€. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that â€œIt wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make â€“ but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money eventsâ€. We even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he â€œjoined the DSCC Majority Trust in Marthaâ€™s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014â€.     How does the US electoral college work?  (Hilariously, in another email chain, the Clinton team appears to scheme to â€œhitâ€ Bernie Sanders for attending â€œDSCC retreats on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard with lobbyistsâ€.) Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta â€“ the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite â€“ for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony. This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should â€œcome from the industry itselfâ€. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one anotherâ€™s careers, constantly. Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the â€œGlobal CEO Advisory Firmâ€ that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, itâ€™s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you arenâ€™t part of this happy, prosperous in-group â€“ if you donâ€™t have John Podestaâ€™s email address â€“ youâ€™re out.",1
"At least 32 people are dead after a coach and truck collided early Sunday on an expressway in Fuxin City, northeast China's Liaoning Province. A spokesman with the Liaoning Public Security Bureau said the accident happened at 3 a.m. when the truck, with an Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region registration, turned the wrong way coming out of a service area. The two vehicles collided head on and began burning. Three people on the truck and 28 passengers on the bus died at the scene, he said. Zhang Zhijing, deputy director of the Zhangwu County People's Hospital, said the hospital had received 25 injured people from the accident. One of four severely injured people had died. The coach, with a Tianjin Municipality registration, had 53 people on board. It was en route from Tianjin to Harbin, capital of the northeastern Heilongjiang Province. Maintenance work was being carried out on the section of the four-lane expressway linking Tieling and Chaoyang cities in Liaoning where the accident happened, according to the local transport authority. The expressway was cleared and traffic resumed shortly after the crash. Chen Zhenggao, governor of Liaoning, is on the way to the accident site to oversee the rescue work. ",1

"Senate Democrats swatted down Republican attempts to make fundamental changes in their health care legislation on Wednesday as the Finance Committee voted on a wide range of amendments that highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill. The committee rejected an amendment offered by Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., that would have deferred a final committee vote until the panel had actual legislative language and a complete cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. The vote was 13-10. Bunning's proposal would have required the text of the bill and the cost estimate to be posted on the Internet for 72 hours before the committee voted on whether to send the bill to the full Senate. 'This bill will impact every American,' Bunning said. 'It is too big and too important for us to rely on conceptual language and a preliminary estimate of cost.' Sen. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the one Republican who might eventually vote for the bill, supported Bunning's proposal. 'The American people are nervous about our attempt at health care reform and overhauling 17 percent of the economy,' Snowe said. 'If it takes two more weeks, it takes two more weeks. What is the rush?' The committee chairman, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., agreed that a detailed summary of the bill, in plain English, and a complete cost analysis would be publicly available before a final committee vote. Much of the debate Wednesday focused on the question of whether the bill would help or hurt older Americans in the Medicare program. Over Republican objections, the committee voted to keep a provision of the bill that would establish an independent federal commission to help rein in the growth of Medicare, the insurance program for 45 million people who are 65 and older or disabled. The commission's recommendations could take effect automatically unless Congress acted to achieve equivalent savings in other ways. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., accused the Republicans of 'delay tactics.' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said, 'There is a substantial slow-walk taking place in this committee.' Baucus said he hoped the committee would approve the bill this week, so it could be merged with a separate bill approved in July by the Senate health committee. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the full Senate could start debate early next month. The White House is pressing Congress to speed action so President Barack Obama can sign a major health care bill this year. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, tested the patience of Democrats by peppering the committee staff with questions about the bill. 'If this were some itty-bitty bill, I could back off very easily,' Hatch said. 'But this is not some itty-bitty bill. It could wreck the country.' By contrast, Democrats described the bill as a long-overdue effort to guarantee Americans access to affordable health care. The committee has yet to wrestle with some of the biggest, most contentious issues: whether to create a government insurance plan to compete with private insurers; whether to impose a new tax on high-cost insurance policies; whether to require individuals to carry insurance and employers to help pay for it; whether to provide additional subsidies to low-income people to help them buy coverage. Senators have proposed amendments to address those issues and others, including abortion, illegal immigrants and medical malpractice. Three Republican senators -- John Ensign of Nevada, Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas -- proposed several amendments to limit awards in malpractice lawsuits. Baucus ruled them out of order, saying the issue was not in the committee's jurisdiction. His rulings were upheld on party-line votes. The Finance Committee is meeting in a large hall, but most of the space is taken up by congressional staff members and journalists. Just four rows at the rear, about 90 seats, are reserved for an audience, and a number have been empty. For major legislation that could affect every American, the audience in the hall and milling outside has been smaller than might have been expected. One reason is modern technology. Many lobbyists, journalists and others are watching the gavel-to-gavel proceedings on C-SPAN. And they can communicate with staff members and even senators by BlackBerry or other devices. Technology has 'taken the circuslike atmosphere away,' said John Jonas, a lobbyist with the Patton Boggs firm, which counts a variety of health care provider groups among its clients. As a former employee of a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, Jonas contrasted the current scene with the crowds of lobbyists who filled that panel's oversize hearing room and spilled into the halls. Jonas said he continued to show up because the Finance Committee room was 'still a good place to catch key staff' -- and he was fresh off a conversation with a committee lawyer. But he added, 'A good lobbyist has done most of his work by now and doesn't have to be clinging to the pant legs or the skirts of whomever they want to get time with.' ",1
"What airline passenger hasnâ€™t felt the letdown?You board a long-haul flight, ready to settle in for hours of binge-watching a popular television series or movie franchise, only to discover the planeâ€™s onboard entertainment is stuck in a time warp, offering outdated content or â€” in a throwback to the 1990s â€” communal television screens for the whole cabin.For a public increasingly accustomed to nearly ubiquitous internet access, with on-demand video and continuous social media feeds, the airline cabin too often feels like a final, frustrating frontier.But David Dicko, a French entrepreneur, is among the many taking aim at in-flight entertainment ennui.His start-up, SkyLights, has built a virtual reality headset that allows travelers to watch the latest 3-D Hollywood releases at their seats. The device, with a six-hour battery life, is coupled with noise-canceling headphones.â€œPeople on planes are hungry for different entertainment options,â€ said Mr. Dicko, whose small team of developers, split between California and France, has been testing the headsets on flights for nearly a year. Last week, XL Airways â€” a low-cost, long-haul French carrier â€” became the first airline to offer a commercial version of SkyLights service to passengers for $16 a flight.â€œPutting virtual reality headsets inside an aircraft is an idea as old as virtual reality itself,â€ said Mr. Dicko, who previously worked as a pilot for Air France-KLM, referring to the decades-old hope of offering passengers 3-D-style entertainment.Mr. Dickoâ€™s 3-D headset is part of an industrywide push to bring carriersâ€™ in-flight entertainment up to the standards that many passengers now expect when they travel by car or train. The onboard efforts include beaming high-speed internet directly to cabins, as well as new partnerships with Netflix and other content streaming services.It is all in recognition of how media-dependent todayâ€™s travelers have become. Many, even most, are accustomed to almost universal internet access through home broadband and mobile internet packages. They are also likely to have subscriptions to video services like Hulu or music services like Spotify. And because many travelers now carry smartphones and tablets on planes, they would like to have the option of viewing and listening to such content, even at 30,000 feet.Analysts say that digital access and entertainment could help airlines, particularly American carriers that are completing a decade-long restructuring, differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive domestic and international market. Consumers can easily shift allegiances if a rival airline offers new amenities like high-speed onboard Wi-Fi.â€œFor the legacy carriers, imitating passengersâ€™ experiences at home is their vision,â€ said Diogenis Papiomytis, an aerospace analyst with the technology research firm Frost & Sullivan in Dubai. â€œThey want to provide seamless connectivity from airport, to aircraft, to when you land at your final destination.â€But technical challenges remain.In the past, experts say, airlinesâ€™ attempts to bring connectivity to aircraft have been hampered by telecommunications technology that soon became outdated or was quickly overwhelmed by unexpectedly high consumer demand.Until very recently, internet services on Delta and American Airlines, among others, were sluggish at best, although airline executives say connectivity speeds are improving. And many of the in-flight entertainment services on decades-old planes have not been upgraded to keep pace with what many travelers can readily gain access to on their smartphones or other mobile devices.â€œThe quality of screens on the latest tablet is as good, if not better, than what you get on a seat-back display,â€ said Oliver Drennan, general counsel for SitaOnAir, a company in Geneva that provides onboard internet and movie-streaming services for airlines including British Airways and Emirates. â€œWireless entertainment will continue to grow enormously,â€ Mr. Drennan said.Much of this momentum is because of multimillion-dollar investments from Gogo, currently the largest onboard Wi-Fi provider, and its competitors, which aim to approach or even match internet speeds available on the ground.About 2,600 commercial aircraft currently use Gogo services. And by the end of this month, about 75 of those planes will have been upgraded to give users internet speeds comparable to what their smartphones can provide on the ground, according to John Wade, Gogoâ€™s chief operating officer. As many as 450 additional planes are to receive similar improvements next year, he said.The new high-speed services are available on aircraft from Delta and Virgin Atlantic, among others, and represent a significant upgrade to Gogoâ€™s existing connectivity options, which have mainly been limited to sending emails or checking social media.ViaSat, another access provider, can offer something better. Currently, 550 planes, including those from JetBlueâ€™s fleet, use the companyâ€™s high-speed satellite network, which already offers speeds similar to those available on peopleâ€™s smartphones. The satellite-delivered service is typically free for streaming Netflix and other internet content, no matter where the planes are in the sky.Travelers can pay hourly to upgrade if they want to use faster speeds for online gaming and other bandwidth-heavy activities. ViaSat plans to expand internationally next year with deals with the likes of Qantas and SAS, and extend its global coverage through two additional satellites by 2019.â€œWi-Fi is becoming part of a carrierâ€™s amenity package,â€ said Don Buchman, vice president for ViaSatâ€™s commercial mobility division. â€œIf drinks and peanuts are free, why shouldnâ€™t Wi-Fi?â€And what might the in-flight entertainment system of the future look like?AnaÃ¯s Marzo, head of aircraft interiors marketing at Airbus, the European aircraft giant, said that passengers now wanted almost constant access to their social media feeds, email accounts and other digital services. But she said that would not detract from traditional onboard options and seat-back television screens, particularly in business or first class where large high-definition displays are now the norm.â€œMore and more people are relying on their own devices on board,â€ Ms. Marzo said, adding that about 60 percent of Airbusâ€™s worldwide fleet, or 16,500 planes, will have some sort of internet connectivity by 2025. But having a smartphone, she said, â€œdoesnâ€™t exclude using a back-of-seat display.â€Others are not so sure.Some airline executives say that travelersâ€™ increasing reliance on their own devices is making carriers review their existing onboard entertainment options. Heavy built-in screens and the miles of fiber-optic cable that serve them, they note, can add significant weight â€” and cost â€” to every flight.Vincent Tomasoni is head of product at XL Airways, the French carrier that, along with offering passengers Skylightsâ€™ new 3-D headsets, also rents tablets to its onboard customers. He says the ability to offer streaming content over in-flight Wi-Fi represents a change for many airlines.Passengers can continue using their own devices while accessing a larger pool of movies, television shows and radio programs, he said, enabling airlines to consider scrapping traditional in-flight entertainment hardware and reducing the cost and complexity of such services.â€œThe world of seat-backed entertainment is over,â€ Mr. Tomasoni said.That is where Mr. Dicko hopes to step in with his SkyLights 3-D headset.Since Mr. Dickoâ€™s company was founded 18 months ago, he and his team have flown thousands of miles to test the headset with passengers. They also are looking to sign more content partnerships beyond those SkyLights currently has with 21st Century Fox and DreamWorks, to offer a larger number of 3-D movies â€” and potentially other virtual reality content â€” to travelers.â€œAirlines are difficult players to deal with because they are risk-averse and slow to innovate,â€ said Mr. Dicko, whose team has tested the SkyLights system with seven carriers worldwide, including Air France-KLM.â€œWe needed their own passengers to tell them that they liked our headset,â€ he added. â€œAt first, people would only use it for 15 minutes. But now, theyâ€™re using it for four hours.â€",1
"Not one person managed to call all six games correctly in last weekâ€™s edition of our Pick Six contest, but this is not the time to feel downhearted. After all, it could be worse. You could be Odell Beckham Jr, getting outshone by a ballboy on Monday Night Football.   Related: Time for Odell Beckham to quit the tantrums and let his talent do the talking   Onwards and upwards. Here are this weekâ€™s games: Atlanta Falcons @ Denver Broncos Averaging a staggering 38 points per game, not to mention 354.2 passing yards (50 more than the next best team), the Falcons just lit up a Carolina defense that was thought to be among the leagueâ€™s best. So could they do something similar to Denver on Sunday? Instinctively, my answer is no: the memory of how the Broncosâ€™ swallowed up one passer after another on the way to last seasonâ€™s Super Bowl is too vivid. But then I look again at those numbers. Matt Ryan has 10.5 yards per attempt this season â€“ a first down, on average, every time he drops back to pass. And if it is important to note that (Carolina aside) he has faced some shabby defenses, then should we not also observe that Denverâ€™s four vanquished opponents so far hold a combined record of 5-11? This feels ripe for an upset to me. Falcons to win Tennessee Titans @ Miami Dolphins Itâ€™s not easy to get behind the Titans. This is a team that won five games combined over the last two seasons. The easy thing would be to glance at this yearâ€™s 1-3 record and assume that not much has changed. Easy, but possibly misguided. After all, every Tennessee defeat has come against a good team â€“ the Vikings, Raiders and Texans have a combined 9-2 record â€“ and the last two of those losses went to the final possession. Were it not for a blown punt coverage and a 12-men-on-the-field penalty that turned another punt into a field goal â€“ mistakes that cost special teams co-ordinator Bobby April his job â€“ they might well have beaten Houston. The Dolphins, meanwhile, needed overtime to seal their only victory, over Cleveland, and unlike Tennessee do not have a reliable ground game to fall back upon. Oh, and they had to cancel practice on Thursday to give players and staff time to prepare for Hurricane Matthew.  Titans to win Washington @ Baltimore Ravens It a less than 35-mile drive from Washingtonâ€™s FedEx Field to Baltimoreâ€™s M&T Bank Stadium, yet this will be just the sixth time that these teams have ever met in a regular season game. It has the makings of a good one, the visitors arriving fresh from consecutive wins whilst the hosts seek to rebound from their first loss of the season. Washington sought to shore up a depleted secondary by adding free agent safeties Donte Whitner and Josh Evans this week, but the bigger concern for me revolves around the teamâ€™s offensive play-calling. Jay Gruden has been loath to run the ball despite obtaining good returns when he does. A heavy dose of Matt Jones might offer Washingtonâ€™s best hope of softening up the leagueâ€™s stingiest defense, but will Washingtonâ€™s coaching staff have the patience to deliver it? Ravens to win Chicago Bears @ Indianapolis Colts Will the jet lag still be nagging at the Colts, as they become the first team to return from a London game without a bye week? And does it really matter, given what a terrible job they were doing of protecting Andrew Luck even before their trip across the pond? Already this season he has been sacked 15 times, the most of any quarterback in the league. The good news for Indy is that the Bears lack the pass rushing talent to exploit this glaring weakness to its fullest. And whilst Chicagoâ€™s offense might actually have been strengthened by injury â€“ Brian Hoyer and Jordan Howard offering more so far than Jay Cutler and Jeremy Langford had done â€“ Iâ€™m not convinced they have the tools to hang in during that inevitable part of the game when Luck does find enough time to find a few targets downfield. Colts to win Buffalo Bills @ Los Angeles Rams  At what point do we start to take the Rams seriously? At 3-1, they sit top of the NFC West and have beaten both the Seahawks and Cardinals to get there. Their defense, with Aaron Donald, Robert Quinn and Michael Brockers causing havoc up front, has smothered opponents at times. On the other hand, the offense is horrid. Case Keenum is a barely serviceable journeyman quarterback throwing to a mess of middling receivers. The one genuine talent on that side of the ball, Todd Gurley, is averaging 2.6 yards per carry behind a hapless and overmatched offensive line. Can this formula really succeed over the course of a season? More immediately, can it succeed against a Buffalo team that has been similarly effective on defense, but combined that strength with consistent success running the ball?  Bills to win Cincinnati Bengals @ Dallas Cowboys Will Dez Bryant be ready to go for Dallas on Sunday? What about left tackle Tyron Smith, cornerback Orlando Scandrick or even kicker Dan Bailey? The list of injured Cowboys only seems to get longer, and this feels like a week in which that reality might finally catch up to them. The Bengals are one of only two NFL teams that is yet to give up a rushing touchdown to any opponent, and the return of Vontaze Burfict last week has only strengthened the front seven further. Will Ezekiel Elliott be able to punch through behind a depleted offensive line? And on defense, who will cover AJ Green? Even if Scandrick does suit up, will he be at 100% for what has the potential to become a pivotal individual matchup? Bengals to win",1
"In what is being regarded as a further provocation on top of his already controversial address before Congress, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down against President Obama Tuesday with a PowerPoint presentation on the perils of the Affordable Care Act. As youll see here in this chart, Obamacare restricts freedom of choice for people who were previously insured through their employers, while simultaneously causing insurance companies to raise their premiums, said Netanyahu, who according to witnesses had finished his original speech criticizing Obamas opposition to further Iran sanctions and immediately announced he would be discussing the presidents fatally flawed and unconstitutional health care overhaul. Now, if we click over to the next slide, we see that the individual mandate forces many Americans to purchase insurance policies they cannot afford or simply dont want. Why should the government be making our health care decisions for us? At press time, Netanyahu was asking if he might have a few more minutes for an abbreviated version of his PowerPoint on the troubling unanswered questions that still surrounded Benghazi. ",0

Why More Riots Are Coming SoonBy Paul Joseph Watson ,0
"A collection of correspondence by Lord Byron broke the world record price Thursday for a group of letters or manuscript by a British Romantic poet, auction house Sotheby's said. The collection, which came from the library of 1894-1895 prime minister Archibald Primrose, the Earl of Rosebery, was sold for 277,250 pounds (458,800 dollars, 309,050 euros). The pre-sale estimate was 150,000 to 180,000 pounds. The collection, which includes 71 handwritten pages, contains many unpublished letters and material detailing relationships as well as his thoughts and pursuits immediately prior to his rise to fame. 'We are absolutely delighted with the above-estimate price achieved for such an important collection of letters by Byron,' said Gabriel Heaton of Sotheby's. 'The pre-sale interest in the collection has been international in its scope and extremely enthusiastic, demonstrating just how prominent Lord Byron remains in the literary canon and in people's affection. 'There has been particular interest in what this unique collection reveals about Byron as a poet as well as the more sensitive and thoughtful side to a man most frequently recognised as one of history's most notorious lotharios. 'The letters talk of love and poetry, of religion, travel and revolution, and their sale has offered a wonderful opportunity to reveal aspects of Lord Byron's character that were either unknown or long-forgotten.'

"Ireland should be drawing up contingency plans for the EU unravelling after Brexit and a possible French departure, an economic adviser to successive Irish governments has said. Dr Sean Barrett urged Enda Kennyâ€™s administration in Dublin to strongly back any French attempt to gain more concessions from Brussels to prevent a possible â€œFrexitâ€. The economic expert claimed the republic had been too distracted by an election earlier this year to do more to persuade fellow EU states to grant David Cameron a better deal from Brussels to prevent Brexit. The Trinity College Dublin academic, one of a core of advisers who persuaded the then taoiseach Charles J Haughey to create a more open economy, leading to the Celtic Tiger economic boom years, said the EUâ€™s collapse was a possibility, especially if the Eurosceptic Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, becomes president of France next year. â€œIf France exits the EU, Ireland would lose a major ally in debates over the common agricultural policy (CAP). Irish agriculture would have to adjust to competition with New Zealand and South America,â€ Barrett said. â€œIrelandâ€™s strategy while the EU survives should emphasise trade and market access, and also to develop trade with the rest of the world, as an insurance against an EU breakup. We should have at least a scenario to develop trade with non-EU countries in case of that breakup.â€ He said the Fine Gael/Independents minority coalition must do more than the government did for Britain in arguing for a better deal for France, to prevent a possible EU meltdown.  â€œIf Ireland wants the French to stay in the EU, presumably to retain an ally to support CAP, we had better form an â€˜entente cordialeâ€™ now. The government has to ask: â€˜What do French voters see as the EUâ€™s defects? And how can we help?â€™ This we failed to do in the UKâ€™s case,â€ Barrett said. â€œThe Brexit referendum took many people in Ireland by surprise, as it did in the UK. Ireland has most to lose from a hard Brexit, with tariffs and border posts reinstated with its main trading partner.   Related: Marine Le Pen, Beppe Grillo, Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry: has their big moment arrived?   â€œIreland should have sought more concessions for the UK in order to give Mr Cameron more to put before voters in the referendum. The Irish general election campaign and the indecisive result occupied the government in the republic for the first half of 2016. These factors, combined with complacency that remain would win, meant that Ireland did not get the UK referendum result it wanted.â€ He said Ireland should have sided with Britain in â€œcurtailing the superstate and regulating migrationâ€ during negotiations with Brussels.  Dublin needs to become one of Franceâ€™s strongest EU allies as the union comes under more strain, Barrett said.    Related: Frexit, Nexit or Oexit? Who will be next to leave the EU   Barrett, a former member of the Seanad, Irelandâ€™s second parliamentary chamber, predicted that the US corporation tax rate would fall under Donald Trump. This would prove massively challenging for Ireland, he said, given its much criticised 12.5% corporation tax rate, which has encouraged US multinationals including Dell, Apple and Google to establish their European bases in the Irish Republic. A longtime critic of the euro, Barrett predicted more turbulence ahead for the single currency.    Related: Angela Merkel and Marine Le Pen: one of them will shape Europeâ€™s future | Natalie NougayrÃ¨de   â€œIreland sleepwalked into the euro currency and paid the price in the banking collapse and bailout. The humiliation of Ireland by the European Central Bank and Mr Claude Trichet in particular has dampened down any remaining Irish enthusiasm for a federal Europe,â€ he said. â€œThe banking and economic collapses were inevitable. It was flawed policies and a flawed currency that brought a country down.â€ The government and main opposition parties insist that Ireland, traditionally one of the most pro-European countries, remains committed to the EU project.  However, since the Brexit vote, there have been a few Irish voices questioning the wisdom of Ireland staying in the EU while its largest trading partner, the UK, is planning to leave. Last month, the broadcaster and television presenter Gay Byrne said the republic should consider leaving the EU on the same day as Britain. â€œSince our main trading partner in Ireland is the UK and our second main trading partner is America, it might be worth considering if they continue with Brexit that we could come out of Europe on the same day that Britain is coming out,â€ he said on his Lyric FM show. The presenter for 37 years of RTÃ‰â€™s The Late Late Show added: â€œI have no idea whether anybody agrees with me or not. We now know that large numbers of people, at least half the population in the UK, are unhappy with Europe, are unhappy with Brussels, are unhappy with what is going on at the moment. There is no reason to believe that the same proportion doesnâ€™t apply in Ireland. â€œA large number of people are unhappy with Brussels and are unhappy with the way Europe is going, and maybe they might consider some other possibility.â€",1
"After Being Named Terrorists, Syrian Al Qaeda Group Says America Still Helps, But Not EnoughBy Baran Hines Al Nusra, commonly known as Syrias branch of Al Qaeda, was declared a terrorist group by the US, United Nations and others in November 2012 after 1 year of terrorist operations. Before this terrorist designation, al-Nusra was supported by the United States as part of what American officials called the legitimate opposition groups fighting against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Abu al-Ezz specifically mentioned the group receives money from US allies including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. Al-Ezz also said Israel supports al-Nusra because Israel is at war with Syria and Hezbollah. Al-Ezz then noted that al-Nusra and Islamic State (IS) were allies but IS was then used for political and strategic purposes by western countries. It became clear to us that most of their leaders work with secret security services, said al-Ezz. Similar suspicions are also widely believed in Iraq as reported last year by the Wall Street Journal. The rise of al-Nusra and Islamic State was a consequence predicted by a 2012 intelligence report leaked to the media in 2015. When asked how the US supports al-Nusra, al-Ezz first said it was indirect because it was through the support of US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the form of cash payments, weapons, and supplies. However, he then confirmed that al-Nusra received American-made TOW missiles directly from Western intelligence officials including Turkey, Israel, and the United States. It is through the American TOW that we have the situation in some regions under control, al-Ezz noted. He then said this is not enough, and that more advanced weaponry is needed. We will fight until the downfall of the regime. We will fight Russia and the West because the West does not stand on our side. The West only sends us mujahedin, it facilitates the way of those fighters. Why doesnt the West support us properly? We have many fighters from Germany, France, Great Britain, America, from all western countries, al-Ezz said. The Syrian war ceasefire negotiated by the US and Russia is being ignored by some of the major opposition groups and those groups are allied with al-Nusra, according to al-Ezz. He also confirmed that the ceasefire has been used by the groups to recover and prepare for the remaining battles of the war. Click here to see the full interview translated in English or view.

Well it started in the 1980s when the US supported the Mahujadeen in Afghanistan has has not stopped since. Now its Russias fault that the ceasefire has broken down because it wont pull in Assads reigns. The fact that the US cant sort the moderates from the Terrorists is also Russias fault as the US is having difficulty themselves sorting out since they cant identify who they arm and who they dont. Its a big job and Russia is not helping even though the moderates had 350 ceasefire allegations against and again the US has more difficulty because there are other players supporting the different groups.

"I lazily plumped for Vienna as the latest stopping-off point on our tour of musical cities, thinking the sheer multiplicity of classical composers who have lived and worked there would make it easy. In fact, of course, it makes choosing which music to focus on very difficult. As the centre of Europeâ€™s musical life for more two centuries, thanks to its status of capital of the Habsburg empire, many of the greats â€“ notably Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven â€“ gravitated to Vienna, and Schubert was born in the city. The trusty @abkquan suggests choosing â€œpieces that describe the city and evoke its atmosphere rather than great pieces written by Viennese composersâ€. He offers the nature-loving Beethovenâ€™s Pastoral Symphony, a work we take for granted but which, if you listen to it afresh, is little short of miraculous.    The Vienna Philharmonic play Beethovenâ€™s Symphony No 6, Pastoral  @abkquan is taken with the Viennese pastoral theme â€“ the city does have it bucolic side â€“ and also suggests Johann Strauss IIâ€™s Tales from the Vienna Woods and, inevitably, the Blue Danube, available in all manner of versions by everyone from the Vienna Philharmonic to AndrÃ© Rieu. The latter has no fewer than 16m hits on YouTube for his version. The Vienna Phil tend to get rather less.   Straussâ€™s Blue Danube Waltz  We must have Johann Srâ€™s Radetzky March, written in 1848 when the Habsburgs were still managing to win battles. I was very pleased to stumble on a clip of the elderly Herbert von Karajan conducting the Vienna Phil at the New Yearâ€™s Day concert in 1987, Karajan smiling in a somewhat forced way and the audience largely terrified to clap along as they like to do with this traditional encore.  This entire column could be filled with the Strauss family. @abkquan draws our attention to Johann Iâ€™s second son, Josef, who died in his early 40s and was eclipsed by the success of his elder brother Johann. But the engaging Dorfschwalben aus Ã–sterreich (Village Swallows from Austria) demonstrates that he had the familyâ€™s facility with dance music.   Ravelâ€™s La Valse  But perhaps that is enough of the Strausses. Several commenters, including @thesecretorganist, suggest Ravelâ€™s La Valse as an antidote to the chocolate-box view of Vienna. La Valse began life as a piece called Vienne, which Ravel saw as a tribute to the age of the waltz. After the first world war, he reworked it as a ballet for Diaghilev. The latter rejected it, leading to a rupture between the two, but it was quickly accepted in the concert hall.  Critics have always seen the work as a commentary on the disintegration of the Hapsburg empire after the war, but Ravel flatly denied that interpretation. â€œIt doesnâ€™t have anything to do with the present situation in Vienna, and it also doesnâ€™t have any symbolic meaning in that regard,â€ he said in 1922. â€œIn the course of La Valse, I did not envision a dance of death or a struggle between life and death.â€ It may, however, be one of those instances where the artistâ€™s intention and the reality of the piece he writes diverge. Somehow, as the piece whirls to its climax, the listener can hear both the apotheosis of the waltz and its destruction.    Franz Schubert, who led â€˜the most agonisingly tragic life of any of the so-called great composersâ€™ Photograph: Rischgitz/Getty Images   We are on safer ground with Schubert, the Viennese composer par excellence. @thesecretorganist sums up his genius far better than I could: â€œHe led perhaps the most agonisingly tragic life of any of the so-called great composers. Dead at just 31; seriously ill with whatâ€™s believed to be syphilis throughout most of his 20s; hopelessly in love with women who just werenâ€™t interested; almost none of his works published during his life â€“ and yet he just kept on writing! When I listen to the music Schubert wrote in the last year of his life, I think: â€˜What on earth would that man have produced if he had lived another five or 10 years, let alone another 50?â€™â€   Listen to Maurizio Pollini play Schubert piano sonatas  I also concur with @thesecretorganistâ€™s choices of Schubertâ€™s most enduring pieces. Winterreise, the Ninth Symphony and the last three piano sonatas are imperishable works that capture longing, joy, suffering and ultimately a fulfilled resignation. Schubert is buried beside his hero Beethoven in Viennaâ€™s main cemetery, the Zentralfriedhof. In 2005, while on a mad mission to hear every note Beethoven composed, I lay beside their graves listening to the Missa Solemnis on headphones. I now wish Iâ€™d listened to Schubertâ€™s B flat major Piano Sonata instead â€“ a message from the dead to the living if ever there was one.   Schubertâ€™s Mass No 6  @thesecretorganist also suggests a less familiar Schubert work â€“ the Mass No 6 in E flat major: â€œIt is a work which hardly ever gets performed, despite the fact it is undoubtedly one of the greatest mass settings of its time, looking forward to Bruckner and beyond.â€ As well as the great lineage of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, composers grouped together in the so-called first Viennese school, there is also the more formalised second Viennese school â€“ composers such as Alban Berg and Anton Webern who took their lead from Arnold Schoenberg and sought to extend the German romantic tradition or, once Schoenberg had embraced serialism and atonality, develop an entirely new approach to composition.    Schoenbergâ€™s VerklÃ¤rte Nacht  The early string sextet VerklÃ¤rte Nacht (Transfigured Night), written in 1899, demonstrates the more conventional early Schoenberg â€“ a masterly setting of a poem by the German writer Richard Dehmel. A decade later, with Erwartung and Pierrot Lunaire, he had revolutionised music. Just as the empire of which Vienna was the centre was crumbling, so the musical tradition that it had fostered was also being subverted. More than a century after its Straussian heyday, Vienna remains a musically rich city, and the public image associated with the Vienna Phil and the New Yearâ€™s Day concert belies the radicalism of its musical life. There is even a third Viennese school, now centred on the Klangforum Wien, a chamber orchestra that specialises in contemporary music.  One of its leading figures is composer Kurt Schwertsik, who after early immersion in the modernist world of Darmstadt broke away from what he saw as its rigidities to write tonal music. He says his fellow modernists saw him as a â€œfreakâ€ for doing so in the 1960s, but musical history has proved what might be called his postmodern compositional style to have been farsighted. Where the fourth Viennese school will take us is anyoneâ€™s guess.   Anton Karasâ€™s music from The Third Man  What we can say for sure is that the next stop on our journey will be Amsterdam, and after that we will end in Berlin. All thoughts on music and musicians associated with these cities will be gratefully received. And in case you thought Iâ€™d forgotten: it would not be possible to survey the music of Vienna without mentioning Anton Karasâ€™s score for the 1948 film The Third Man. Never has a zither been used to greater effect. Previous cities in this series: London | Paris | Venice | Helsinki | Prague | Hamburg | Rome. ",1

"Arnaud Djoum rescued a draw for Hearts as the Edinburgh side fought back to share the spoils in a 3-3 thriller with Inverness in the Highland capital. David Raven volleyed Inverness into the lead after 15 minutes and Lonsana Doumbouya hit the crossbar before he doubled the home teamâ€™s advantage. Bjorn Johnsen gave Hearts a foothold in the game before half-time when the home side appeared to switch off and six minutes after the break a speculative cross-shot from defender Faycal Rherras drifted into the goal for an equaliser.

"Time to Take Note of USA FirstsCatherine J. Frompovich First and foremost, it seems that the USA quickly is becoming a police-controlled population or state. That dubious recognition is attained from incarceration statistics, which certainly are not enviable. Back in October of 2012, Salon featured the article US has more prisoners, prisons than any other country.[1] According to the International Centre for Prison Studies, the USA had 730 incarcerated persons for every 100,000 in population. We towered over the second-best rival, the Czech Republic, which had slightly over 200 incarcerations per 100,000 population. The USA outshined Mexico for Numero Uno; Mexicos rate was 200 per 100,000. According to the Federation of American Scientists, [2, 3] the USA was Number One in arms deliveries to the world by supplier for the years 1999 through 2006 inclusive. Taxpayers forked over a grand sum totaling $107,672 Millions of constant 2006 U.S. dollars. The USA outshined and outspent its nearest contender, Russia, several times over, since Russia ponied up a measly $38,754 Millions of constant 2006 U.S. dollars. Was that money well spent? Who knows, since it represents what many consider the Republican Bush-2 war horse machine that got us into inextricable military action. But, it did get us to be Numero Uno! Regarding percentage of Gross Domestic Production (GDP) spent on healthcare, the USA outranks every country as of 2007 data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a whopping 15.3%. Next is Switzerland with 11.6%; then Germany at 10.7%; the United Kingdom at 8.3%; and Japan at 8% almost half the U.S. GDP. [4] Notation ought to be made that the U.S. Congressional Budget Office projects that total U.S. healthcare spending will reach 31% of GDP by 2035. [5] Now, lets compare what we are getting for our GDP outlay as a return on longevity or life expectancy at birth and compared with: So, it looks like Japans 8% GDP in 2007, which was almost half the USA, secured for the Japanese a life expectancy of 5.1 years more than the USA, who spent 15.3% GDP. [6] According to OECD statistics for 2007, infant mortality rates place the USA into a position it should not be in, i.e., considering all the money spent, our advanced medical technology, and vaccines, which are touted to prevent childhood and other diseases. In the category Infant Mortality (Deaths per 1000 Live Births): [7] In trying to weigh the benefits of healthcare parameters that affect overall health outcomes, we need to consider the role that vaccines play in health. Lets check out this chart for starters. Now, for sake of argument, consider the Lifespan Rankings in 2009. Japan was Number 4; the USA was Number 34! Moreover, did you notice that the 2011 statistic for USAs Life Ranking slipped to 39? Here is something else to ponder. Lets examine another chart to see some extremely interesting data. The Mortality Increase Trendline climbs from a low end of mandated vaccines of 11 to the high end of mandated vaccines: 36 in the United States in 2009. How does that vaccine mandate affect healthcare costs from several perspectives, i.e., costs of vaccines and their administration, including costs of healthcare services and vaccine failures for premature birth, sick, and dying children, who may be impacted by the very vaccines they receive, since the graph below seems to associate mortality and number of vaccines given? Questions should be airborne in science and the U.S. court system about the possible role of vaccines in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS According to WHY IS HEALTH SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES SO HIGH? by the OECD, The United States spends two-and-a-half times more than the OECD average health expenditure per person (Chart 1). It even spends twice as much as France, for example, a country which is generally accepted as having very good health services. At 17.4% of GDP in 2009, US health spending is half as much again as any other country, and nearly twice the average. [10] If we examine the chart at http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/49084355.pdf , we see how the USA is Number One in health expenditures per capita, but apparently: (a) not very healthy; (b) not getting our moneys worth; and (c) in need of a complete overhaul for better quality of care, something that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) may not provide but, in actuality, will result in an escalation of health insurance costs enforced by the IRS. According to About.com, The Obamacare ruling allows the IRS to tax you 1% of adjusted gross income (above the taxable minimum income), but no less than $95 per adult/$47.50 per child in 2013. These taxes rise in 2015 and 2016. For more, see Obamacare Taxes. [11] Before we leave the vaccine component in this article, heres a chart that needs to be studied since it implicates the role of chemicals in disease, and seemingly with polio. Please study this chart. We note that there is no indication of paralytic polio epidemic(s) worldwide prior to the 1886 epidemic in Sweden. Polio starts to escalate during the World War I years when mustard gas and phosgene [13] were used in combat. Then polio intensifies into pandemic proportions with the introduction of many DDT-like chemicals. Note that DDT was discovered to cause nerve damage, paralysis and death by respiratory failure in calves, via milk. 1953, confirmed by Swiss. So, lets see where the USA stands on the production of chemicals. Again, the USA is Numero Uno in chemical shipments per Wikipedias Chemical Industry. [14] According to the United Nations Survey Report [15], the United States is Number One in total number of crimes! Numero Uno, again, according to the map showing the top ten countries with the highest reported crime rates. The Washington Post in June of 2005 reported, Study: U.S. Leads in Mental Illness, Lags in Treatment. [16] We lead the world in a lot of good things, but were also leaders in this one particular domain that wed rather not be, according to Ronald Kessler, the Harvard professor of health care policy who led the study. What about pharmaceutical drugs? How does the USA stack up with them? Well, according to bls.gov, Total value of U.S. consumption of pharmaceutical drugs in 2009 was $300 billion, or about 40 percent of the worldwide market share, and reflected a 37-percent increase since 2003. [17] With close to 306 million people in the USA in January of 2009 and an estimated 6 billion 8 hundred thousand plus people world-wide in March of 2009, we realize just how disproportionate a use40% of the worldwide pharmaceutical drug market sharethere is in the USA. Why? Are pharmaceuticals over-prescribed in the U.S., or are we just sicker than the rest of the world? With that amount of pharmaceutical consumption, we undoubtedly have to be Number One. After reviewing these statistics, U.S. healthcare consumers, taxpayers, voters, and those who regulate and govern in the United States need to take a long, hard, conscientious look at how the U.S. excels where it should not. Everyone ought to realize that being Number One in so many areas where we would rather not beand should not be considering capital outlay in healthcare, especiallyis cause for major concern, plus definite confirmation of the desperate need for fundamental reform and the change we were promised, not the same old lip service with higher taxes, especially those coming in the name of healthcare insurance.

"Four southern Mexican states were drenched by the remnants of Tropical Storm Matthew on Monday, the National Water Commision (CONAGUA) said. State Chiapas was worst hit with 257 mm of rain, followed by neighboring Oaxaca with 191 mm, and Gulf of Mexico state Veracruz with 182 mm. Tabasco was comparatively less hit with 101 mm of rain, the agency said in a statement. CONAGUA also published a photo of Matthew changing into multiple small storms mainly over Tabasco and Chiapas on its website, and it suggested people living along riverside on the boundary between the two states move to higher ground as the water 'will rise very rapidly.' The storm, which is already weakened, passed through Central American country Nicaragua on Friday and made landfalls there. Then it crossed into Honduras and toppled utility poles, causing a power outage lasting for hours. ",1
"Bilderberg Group Quietly Meets in ItalyBrandon Turbeville Yet, although much of the European press is dark on the issue, which is unfortunately characteristic of the mainstream media in any nation, some Italian newspapers are reporting the information regarding the meeting. According to 21stCenturyWire, the agenda apparently centered around the fate of EU countries such as Italy, Spain, and Greece, three nations that have been hit hard with the worldwide derivatives crisis and the subsequent imposition of austerity. Various newspapers from all across Italy are reporting that around 80 members of the Bilderberg Group, particularly the Bilderberg Steering Committee, have been called to Rome for a semi-secret meeting to discuss the unfolding events of the engineered crisis. In contradiction to the traditional methods of secrecy used by the Bilderberg Group such as renting entire hotels for days on end and dispensing with the guests and even some of the workers during the conference, this Italian Bilderberg meeting is taking place at the same time as another popular event, the Rome Film Festival. Thus, instead of meeting in total secret, it appears the Bilderberg Group is attempting to hide its treachery in plain sight while blending in with the rest of the crowd of actors, actresses, directors, and general celebrities. In a cruel twist of irony and outright disdain for the little people, and as J.G. Vibes of the Intel Hub writes, Italian newspapers estimate the cost of the Rome meeting to be around 100,000 euros for 80 people in attendance. According to Italian website, DagoSpia.com, the attendees list appears as follows: Enrico Letta, Enrico Bondi, Mario Monti, Marlieke de Vogel, Corradino Passera, Education Minister Francesco Profumo, Paola Severino, Elsa Fornero, Guiliano Amato, Governor of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, Lilli Gruber, Chicco Mentana, Bebe Bernabe, Flebuccio de Bortoli, Vendeline von Bredow, Mauro Moretti of CGIL, Alberto Nagel the CEO of Mediobanca, Angelo Gimbals the Chairman of Agcom, Federico Ghizzoni of Unicredito, Enrico Teaspoons of Intesa, Fulvio Conti of Enel, Anna Marion Tarantola who is the President of Rai, Rodolfo De Benedetti the President of the CIR, and Ignazio Vis the Governor of the Bank of Italy.

"Michelle Obamas Dark Past Reveals Itself Once Again Well it turns out that Michelle Obama might be to blame for her daughter Malias rebellious behavior. Turns out, Michelle was a bit of a problem child herself, and the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. According to recent interviews, Michelles difficult streak began when she was only a decade old. I was going through my cursing stage, the First Lady admitted in her biography. I didnt realize until my camp counselor at the end came up and said, You know, you would have been the best camper in your age group, but you curse so much. Although most would point the finger at Malia, Michelles mother Marion Robinson claims that Sasha is more like her difficult mother. This isnt the first time weve heard about Michelles tumultuous past. Before she was the first lady, Michelle once dated Patti LaBelles son. Her own freshman year roommate at Princeton had to move because she didnt want to put up with her. What do you think? Are you ready for the Obamas to be out of the White House for good? ",0
"Seven men have been indicted on sex trafficking charges in what federal officials said on Tuesday was an international organization that exploited adult and underage women for more than a decade in Mexico and the United States.Four of the men â€” identified as Efrain Granados-Corona, 41; Alan Romero-Granados, 24; and the brothers Pedro Rojas-Romero, 37, and Emilio Rojas-Romero, 34 â€” were arrested in Mexico by the authorities there last week. Raul Romero-Granados, 32, and Isaac Lomeli-Rivera, 34, were arrested in the United States, the United States attorneyâ€™s office in Manhattan said. The seventh man, Juan Romero-Granados, brother of Alan, remained a fugitive.All seven could face life sentences in federal court in New York on charges of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.In a statement announcing the arrests, federal authorities enumerated the often brutal methods of the organization, which they described as a family business that has been operating since at least 2000.The operation would start in Mexico, where traffickers worked to isolate victims from their families and subjected them to physical and sexual abuse. Often kept in locked apartments, their communication monitored, the women would be forced into prostitution to help traffickers repay a debt, the authorities said. They typically worked in the Mexico City neighborhood La Merced, forced to see as many as 20 to 40 customers a day.Eventually, the victims would be smuggled to the United States, where they were housed in shared apartments but were forbidden to talk to one another. Under continual threats of violence and other forms of coercion, the women would typically work for brothels or prostitution delivery services, in which they were driven to customers in New York and other states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia.â€œThe indictment outlines alleged conduct of these defendants that is brutal and predatory,â€ Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in the statement. â€œThe defendants allegedly raped, beat, tortured and enslaved their victims, often minors who were coercively separated from their families.â€The victims had to give their earnings to the traffickers or the traffickersâ€™ families, prosecutors said.Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the arrest was the result of a successful collaboration with Mexican law enforcement agencies. â€œWe thank them for their cooperation in this important action and for their ongoing collaboration in our shared efforts to end human trafficking in our nations,â€ Ms. Lynch said in the statement.Angel M. Melendez, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called the trafficking â€œa modern form of slavery.â€An estimated 14,500 to 17,500 people are trafficked to the United States every year, according to statistics cited by the Department of Health and Human Services.",1
"The death toll from the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Chile early Saturday has reached 723, and at least 19 people are unaccounted for, the Chilean government said on Monday According to the National Emergency Office (Onemi), most of the deaths were reported in Maule region, where there were 544 deaths. There were 64 deaths and 38 deaths in Bio Bio region and the capital city of Santiago, respectively, it added. Both Maule and Bio Bio regions have been declared catastrophe zones and are under the administration of civilian and military authorities. A powerful tsunami triggered by quake devastated coastal towns of the affected regions, leaving an undetermined number of missing people. The Onemi also said that in the most affected southern regions, authorities began to deliver food and equipment for power generation. In the hard-hit towns of Curcio, Talca and Concepcion, temporary hospitals have been set up to replace those damaged by the earthquake, it added. The Chilean Health Ministry has launched a blood-donation campaign for quake victims, while urging people to stay home and not to go to aid supply distribution places except in case of need. ",1
"To the Editor:Re â€œNorth Korea Threatens Nuclear Test, Defying U.N.â€ (news article, March 15):As North Korea keeps escalating its nuclear threats, our leaders must continue bolstering our defenses.The linchpin of these defenses is the ground-based midcourse defense, or G.M.D., system. This vital insurance policy can detect an enemy missile when it is launched and destroy it midflight with interceptors based in Fort Greely in Alaska or Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.The defense has been successful in 10 live-fire tests and has proved that it can stop an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile, but it must be fully funded and improved to keep up with the changing threat. New funding will ensure that we can add interceptors at our bases, deploy the newest radar systems and update the â€œkill vehicleâ€ that actually collides with the target missile.Costing less than one-half of 1 percent of the defense budget,G.M.D. is extremely cost-effective and reliable, protecting us against one of the worldâ€™s gravest threats.North Koreaâ€™s nuclear threats may be empty rhetoric, but there is no way to be sure; it would be irresponsible to ignore them and simply â€œhope for the best.â€ADOLPHUS JOHNSONBirmingham, Ala.The writer, a retired Army staff sergeant, served in Iraq and Afghanistan.",1
"Opponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner donâ€™t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law.Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in todayâ€™s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.Politicians were piling on this week to criticize the deal, including Donald J. Trump; Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president; and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota. Still to be heard from is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a prominent foe of corporate consolidation.A younger generation of antitrust scholars who are rethinking the nationâ€™s fundamental approach to antitrust law may prove even more influential.â€œOver the last 40 to 50 years, antitrust law has evolved to be almost completely indifferent to vertical mergers,â€ said Tim Wu, an antitrust and internet expert at Columbia Law School who coined the phrase â€œnet neutralityâ€ and recently wrote â€œThe Attention Merchantsâ€ on the advertising business.In vertical mergers, a company buys a supplier; in horizontal mergers, direct competitors combine.But the new generation harks back to the original trustbusters of the early 20th century, who were most concerned about preventing corporations from gaining too much power.â€œThe antitrust system as it stands is focused on prices to consumers, innovation and efficiencies,â€ Mr. Wu said. â€œThat reflects the triumph of the University of Chicago school of economics. But thereâ€™s an older tradition, embodied by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, that says a concentration of too much power in too few hands is bad for democracy and bad for consumers.â€Scott Hemphill, an antitrust and intellectual property professor at New York University School of Law, agreed. â€œVertical deals rarely get prohibited outright,â€ he said. â€œModern antitrust case law has pretty much kept politics out of the analysis.â€â€œBut is antitrust law only about economics, or does enhanced political power play a role?â€ Mr. Hemphill asked. â€œWould a combined AT&T and Time Warner put too much power in one company? Thatâ€™s the big question.â€Itâ€™s a question AT&T says it is prepared to answer. â€œIf someone is looking for a test case to overturn the time-honored judicial precedents of vertical mergers, this is not the case,â€ David R. McAtee II, AT&Tâ€™s general counsel, told me this week. â€œWhat we have here is a classic vertical merger that will benefit consumers in an environment thatâ€™s begging for innovation.â€Given antitrust precedents, itâ€™s no wonder AT&T and Time Warner would expect regulatory approval, even if they have to accept some conditions imposed by the government. Time Warner is so confident the deal will be approved that it negotiated a paltry breakup fee (by megamerger standards) in the event itâ€™s blocked: just $500 million.At nearly every opportunity, Randall L. Stephenson, AT&Tâ€™s chief executive, and other architects of the deal have repeated the â€œverticalâ€ mantra. As Mr. Stephenson told me this weekend, â€œThis is strictly a vertical merger. Weâ€™re combining with one of our big suppliers. Youâ€™d be hard pressed to find a vertical merger denied by the regulators. They wonâ€™t give us a free pass, but we expect that if they have concerns, theyâ€™ll impose conditions to address them.â€Mr. Stephenson is right about that. Time Warner is just one of many content suppliers to AT&T, albeit an important one. Time Warner competes vigorously with other film and television studios, cable networks, and producers of news and entertainment.AT&T competes in cable delivery systems, satellite and wireless. While more concentrated than news and entertainment (there are just four major wireless carriers), they are still competitive markets.This isnâ€™t a â€œhorizontalâ€ American Airlines-US Airways merger (which inexplicably passed antitrust review) or even the earlier 21st Century Fox bid, which Time Warner rebuffed in part because of antitrust concerns.Since neither firm competes with the other one, merging the two would have little or no effect on market concentration. And the dealâ€™s architects are promising a bevy of virtues for consumers, from more wireless video access to lower prices.Case closed?Thanks in large part to groundbreaking books in the 1970s by the Supreme Court nominee and Yale Law School antitrust scholar Robert Bork (â€œThe Antitrust Paradoxâ€) and Richard Posner (now an influential judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals) at the University of Chicago Law School (â€œAntitrust Lawâ€), vertical mergers came to be viewed as usually promoting competition and, by extension, consumer welfare.The view was embraced by the Supreme Court and embedded in the Justice Departmentâ€™s vertical merger guidelines during the Reagan administration.Vertical merger challenges arenâ€™t unheard-of, but few have been blocked entirely. A Georgetown University Law Center study found 46 vertical enforcement actions in the 20-year period from 1994 to 2013, including a 1994 suit to block AT&Tâ€™s acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications, a groundbreaking deal that paved the way for AT&Tâ€™s entry into wireless communication. (AT&T completed the merger after reaching a consent decree with the Justice Department.)The proposed Comcast-NBC Universal deal set off an avalanche of criticism from rival media companies and consumer advocates who argued that it consolidated too much power in one company. In 2011 the Justice Department sued to block the deal on grounds it had the potential to disadvantage competitors that delivered video services, such as satellite broadcasters and telecom companies, and emerging online video providers like Netflix.In an opinion that has no doubt been closely scrutinized by AT&Tâ€™s antitrust lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a federal judge ruled that the conditions Comcast accepted to ease the regulatorâ€™s concerns â€œwill provide a prompt, certain and effective remedy for consumers by diminishing Comcastâ€™s abilityâ€ to â€œharm competition.â€Whether that has indeed been the case will no doubt be the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators. â€œItâ€™s important to assess how well the NBC consent decree has done,â€ Mr. Hemphill said. â€œOn the face of things, online video seems to be thriving. But has Comcast engaged in troubling behavior as a result of owning NBCUniversal? Thatâ€™s an important question for thinking about this deal.â€Susan P. Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School and author of â€œCaptive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,â€ was an influential voice in encouraging regulators to oppose the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. She predicted the same fate for AT&T-Time Warner.â€œI think this is unlikely to be approved,â€ she said. â€œThere were very few public benefits to the Comcast/NBCU deal, which should not have gone through. Itâ€™s difficult even to identify a public benefit for this one.â€Mr. McAtee of AT&T said it would â€œbe fundamentally inconsistent and unfairâ€ for the government to reject AT&Tâ€™s deal for Time Warner after it approved the Comcast NBC Universal merger.â€œWe feel we have an even stronger case,â€ he added. â€œComcast was a dominant, entrenched cable and broadband provider, and NBC Universal had big broadcast licenses in an ecosystem where over-the-top video was still in its infancy. Yet the government approved the deal with conditions. On all counts, we have a stronger case for approval.â€AT&T and Time Warner executives will have many months to make their argument to consumers, Congress, regulators and the White House. But thereâ€™s a risk they will find themselves in the midst of a revolution in antitrust thinking that transcends any one case.â€œItâ€™s interesting that both presidential candidates have said theyâ€™d take a close look at this,â€ Mr. Wu said. â€œSo one of the first tests for the new president will be where they come down on this: Will it be Louis Brandeis or the University of Chicago?â€",1
"The deceased daughter of James and Martha Hagerty would have wanted her parents to relentlessly pursue a $220 million liability settlement against the manufacturer of the allegedly defective merchandise that caused her death, the family announced Wednesday. 'While Kaylee is no longer with us, we know she'd be absolutely heartbroken if we agreed to a payout that didn't reach well into the nine figures,' read a statement from the Hagertys, who have fought tooth and nail to secure a multimillion-dollar penalty from Nordic Window Fashions, the company they contend sold faulty pull-cord venetian blinds and thus bears responsibility for Kaylee's fatal 2009 strangulation. 'Wherever my baby girl is now, she's looking down on us and smiling as we initiate proceedings toward a multipart civil settlement that includes lump-sum compensatory and punitive damages, along with attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.' The Hagertys' lead attorney, Bryson Tuttle of Tuttle-Wembert P.C., echoed his clients' sentiment, adding that Kaylee would never have settled for Nordic's latest offer of $150 million and would in fact have considered it 'a complete insult.'

"Let the backlash begin. Like some of the most polarizing best picture winners -- 'Shakespeare in Love,' 'Crash,' 'No Country for Old Men' -- Wednesday's Academy Award rules change to its top category is splitting Oscar voters. The chorus of dissenters says the new inclusion of 10 best picture nominees will diminish the award's value, encourage bloc voting for obscure titles and possibly yield a best picture winner that earns less than 11 percent of the total votes cast. 'I think it undermines the integrity of the Academy Awards,' said marketing consultant Dennis Rice, a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' public relations branch. 'I have trouble most years finding five movies to nominate.' Said Robert Solo, an academy member for more than 35 years and the producer of 1978's 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers': 'It just eviscerates the whole value of the award. They did this because they're not getting the television ratings. Is this what the academy is about? They're worried the program would be canceled, but that's not why the academy was created. This is merchandising. This is not award giving.' The organization Wednesday said that it was doubling the number of best picture nominees from five to 10 starting with next year's awards (the ceremony is scheduled for March 7). Ratings for the annual Oscar broadcast have been plummeting, and even though this year's broadcast attracted more viewers -- 36.3 million -- than recent shows, the academy has been looking for ways to give the ceremony a more populist appeal. 'There will still only be one winner, but we have to change with the times,' said producer Hawk Koch, an academy vice president and member of its board of governors who supports the rule change. 'We are not only an organization of small independent films.' Koch did say, however, that because there will be 10 finalists for the top trophy, the academy at its next board meeting will discuss whether to amend its voting procedures, where the film with the most votes -- no matter the total -- takes the statuette. All of the roughly 5,800 members of the academy are eligible to vote for the best picture nominees and winner. 'We want to make sure 11 percent doesn't get best picture,' said Koch, the producer of 'Untraceable.' In increasing the number of best picture finalists, the awards group hopes it might be able to recognize box-office blockbusters that typically do not make the short list for Hollywood's highest honor. But several academy members, some of whom said they were blindsided by the announcement, and Oscar campaign strategists said it wasn't clear if the additional best picture spots would go to box-office hits such as 'Star Trek' and 'Up' or substantially less popular (but critically acclaimed) art movies. Under the academy's voting rules, the tabulations of which films narrowly missed being nominated for best picture are known only to the accountants, so no one involved in the rules change knows if last year's runners-up were 'Doubt' and 'The Wrestler' or 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man.' Judd Bernard, an academy member and producer of 'The Marseille Contract,' said he was surprised by Wednesday's news and felt the rank and film should have been asked about the rules change before it was announced. He was concerned that by trying to include blockbuster titles the academy will overvalue box-office returns. 'I do hope that this does not mean that just because a picture makes 9 zillion dollars, it will automatically be an academy picture,' Bernard said. 'Next year's winner will be `Transformers.' A picture makes a lot of money, but it doesn't mean it's a great movie. If excellence in achievement just meant money, then Bernie Madoff would get an academy award.' The rules change no doubt will boost the income of Oscar consultants, who can charge $15,000 a month for coordinating a movie's awards campaign, and then receive bonuses of as much as $20,000 for a nomination in a top category and another $20,000 for a win. Several consultants, who declined to be identified, said they were concerned that small but cohesive blocs of Oscar voters -- there are 400 academy members in the United Kingdom, for example, who might band together for one movie -- might be able to push a little movie into the big category. Under the ranked system used by the Academy to select nominees (which is a different from the procedure to pick winners), the voting members will list their top 10 best picture selections in order of preference. According to Douglas Amy, a professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College who is an expert on voting systems, it will now take as few as 525 people putting a movie as one of their top choices for that film to land among the 10 potential best picture winners (assuming most of the members vote). When there were five nominees, the minimum requirement was around 930, Amy said. (Optional add end) 'The good part about this is it means a wider variety of movies that a significant minority like should be chosen,' he said. With an extra five slots available, in other words, ranked voting will allow films that provoke strongly divergent opinions but have a passionate voting bloc to land a nomination. Movies that do not receive any first-place votes are eliminated from best picture consideration. Therefore, it is conceivable that films that are many voters' fifth or eighth picks won't get a nomination. David Foster, a veteran producer ('The Mask of Zorro,' 'The River Wild') and academy member, said he welcomed the changes. 'Clearly something was wrong the last bunch of years. If something is wrong with something, you have to figure out a way to correct it,' Foster said. 'I think it's good we expand. Some of the old rules are too old. This is the 21st century, for God's sake.' ",1
"After several months of diligent effort, staff members working on Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign confirmed Wednesday they have made significant progress in conditioning her to convincingly recreate and convey a limited spectrum of emotions. According to aides who drill the Democratic frontrunner for several hours each day on her emotional responses to a variety of stimuli, Clinton can now effectively exhibit concern, mild excitement, and incredulity. Intensive training is reportedly still underway on some of the more challenging-to-produce emotions, such as polite interest and personal warmth. The headway Hillary has made is really encouraging, especially when you consider what we started with, said staffer Cheryl Dums, who later added that when she began working with Clinton, the candidate was only able to fluctuate between stony neutrality and terrifying anger. Were very proud that she can now display a virtually indistinguishable facsimile of empathy. Its the result of a behavioral modification technique in which we rigorously reinforce any approximations of compassion that happen to flash across her face while she listens to the concerns of voters. Were hopeful that shell have a functional range of 11 or even 12 emotions by the time the early primaries roll around, Dums added. In her current program of operant conditioning, Clinton is reportedly shown a series of imagessuch as a widow crying at her spouses funeral, a family opening presents on Christmas morning, and former House speaker Newt Gingrichdesigned to induce specific emotional responses, and depending on the appropriateness of her subsequent facial expressions and other body language, she is either rewarded or punished. Staffers said they began the process by slowly and painstakingly pairing a correct reaction with a correct stimulus. They reportedly first trained the former secretary of state to reproduce a happy emotion by repeatedly showing her a photo of a small child playing with a kitten and then rubbing a soft cloth on her face while physically holding her mouth in the shape of a smile until, eventually, she could display a passable simulacrum of joy. There are definitely some crossed wires, like how she nods and applauds after hearing the story of a family that lost their home to foreclosure, campaign consultant Allison Stevens said. But its just a matter of time and patience. When she gets a response wrong, we spritz her in the face with cold water from a spray bottle, and when she gets one right, we let her work on her memoirs for a little bit or call her Madam President in soothing tonesshe loves that. She also really likes Luna Bars, Stevens continued. Shell do just about anything for a Luna Bar! Staff members acknowledged that Clinton would be subject to extremely rapid regression if she were not conditioned with absolute consistency. They told reporters they didnt want her to go back to the days when people she met on the campaign trail would voice their deepest worries and she would respond to each by loudly stating, I am feeling empathy toward you. There have definitely been some setbacks, senior aide Tim Balducci said. Yesterday, when a reporter asked for her thoughts on the surge in refugees crossing the Mediterranean, she panicked and rapidly cycled through the eight or so responses wed equipped her with thus far before making a painfully stilted reply. We really hope to get that ironed out before the first debate next month. Other campaigns have taken note of Clintons progress and implemented similar programs, with Chris Christies staffers reporting this week that they have already had some limited success in training the New Jersey governor not to bite people or defecate on the floor.

" Eighteen months ago, I discovered someone who changed my life forever. His name is Teodor Currentzis. Heâ€™s a conductor who has recorded three operas for Sony music that are the single greatest albums that I have ever heard. And I donâ€™t say that lightly. The problem is, theyâ€™re opera. I know. The art form thatâ€™s apparently been dying for decades and that has a reputation for snobbishness, inaccessibility and general wankiness. Truth be told, I have always loathed it â€“ but stay with me. These three are by Mozart, which helps. Operaâ€™s biggest deterrent for me is Wagner. Chubby women shrieking at you in German for six hours simply cannot be described as entertainment â€“ unless you like being bound, gagged and whipped in basement flats in Mayfair. But Mozart is a different kettle of musical fish altogether. The guy, dead at 35, composed music that came straight from Godâ€™s mouth. And his three greatest operas are The Marriage of Figaro (Le Nozze di Figaro), CosÃ¬ fan Tutte and Don Giovanni. Operas with ridiculous plots and even more intricate and ludicrous subplots. But underneath the farcical stories are important, powerful messages about the nature of love, humanity and our capacity for forgiveness. And Mozart sets these stories to the most profound music imaginable.    The problem with classical music is that it is only ever as good as the performance you are hearing or witnessing, which is why interpreters such as Gould, Karajan, Horowitz and Callas are so immortal. They were capable of reimagining what was set down on paper hundreds of years earlier and offering it to audiences in the present day in a way that shook, and still shakes, the foundations of our reality. So along comes a young Greek conductor called Teodor Currentzis. He is the conducting equivalent of Glenn Gould morphed with Kurt Cobain. Gould said there is no point performing something thatâ€™s been performed a thousand times before unless you do it differently. And Currentzis, who has a work ethic and attention to detail that would have made Steve Jobs look like an unemployed bum, goes way, way beyond that.   Itâ€™s as if Currentzis has found a wormhole and tunnelled back in time into Mozartâ€™s mind      He formed his own orchestra, Musica Aeterna, hand-picking the very best musicians he could find â€“ largely from Russia, where they have quite the selection. He somehow convinced Sony to inject an obscene amount of money, and he set to work producing and recreating definitive performances of Mozartâ€™s three greatest operas. He records in Perm, a city in the middle of Russia whose temperature redefines cold. He, his orchestra and singers, along with producers, sound engineers and technicians, spend weeks in what can only be described as a classical music lock-in â€“ they live, eat and breathe there, and the majority of their waking moments are spent creating music. Hundreds of hours of takes are recorded, with Currentzis pushing everyone involved beyond the limits of what most would consider possible. He chooses speeds that are, to many, unplayable. Vocal techniques that are not taught in any schools. Interpretations that make most music critics and regular opera audiences question everything they thought they knew. His conception of these works is so grand, so life-affirming and life-changing, so far beyond anything that has come before it that it has, for me, redefined music itself. This is classical music breaking the four-minute mile.    â€˜Itâ€™s about love, itâ€™s about being human.â€™ The Marriage of Figaro with Iain Paterson as Figaro and Sarah Tynan as Susanna in a 2007 English National Opera production. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian   I found his albums by dumb luck and have spent hundreds of hours listening to them. They accompany me everywhere. There are no other recordings where I know, just absolutely know, that this is how the composer himself would have heard it while he was writing it down. Itâ€™s as if Currentzis has found a wormhole and tunnelled back in time into Mozartâ€™s mind. Everything about his approach is groundbreaking. The attack of the strings, the unbelievable presence of the sound â€“ you feel as if youâ€™re sitting right in the middle of the orchestra as melody after melody sweeps through your ears, the quality of the singing, the sheer, visceral, driving energy, the humour, pathos, romance, verve, face-punching force of it all is overwhelming.  I donâ€™t think opera really deserves its rep. One of my favourite stories about CosÃ¬ is that the librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte, had a mistress for whom he wrote one of the main roles. Mozart loathed her. And he noticed that when she sang high notes she would lift her face to the sky and when she sang low notes she would drop her chin to her chest. And so while he was writing her famous, showcase aria, Come Scoglio (Like a Rock â€“ sheâ€™s declaring that sheâ€™s going to be completely faithful to her fiance; a blatant lie as it turns out), he fills the whole thing with jumps from high to low and low to high, in order, to quote Mozart, â€œto make her head bob up and down like a chickenâ€. I think of Mozart conducting this, watching the soprano nodding her head up and down and giggling to himself. Most amazing is the fact that Mozart wrote one of the greatest and most beautiful operatic arias ever, while simultaneously taking the piss out of a woman he detested.   These albums offer me a deeper understanding of myself, an unimaginable beauty and a window into another, better, world      The Marriage of Figaro story, with its infidelity, mistaken identity, cross-dressing â€“ the whole shebangâ€“ is as idiotic as CosÃ¬â€™s. But in both there is a deeper reality about love, and being human. Figaroâ€™s ending (in Currentzisâ€™s hands) makes me sob every time. In fact many times I just canâ€™t listen to the last few tracks because I genuinely think Iâ€™ll throw myself under a train. The cheating Count, who really doesnâ€™t deserve the â€œoâ€ in his title, has really, really screwed up with his wife. And heâ€™s been caught red-handed. He drops to his knees and sings the most beautiful, pleading, desperate aria, Contessa perdono! â€“ â€œCountess, forgive me!â€. And the Countess, more kind than he (PiÃ¹ docile io sono â€“ â€œI am more mildâ€), forgives her husband. Just like that. In one musical phrase comes a hammer-blow definition of true love that just about cleaves your heart in two. Love does indeed conquer all. I donâ€™t trust anyone or anything. Iâ€™m the anti-trust guy. But Currentzis, I trust. His albums have become one of my best friends. They offer me everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted â€“ a deeper understanding of myself, an unimaginable beauty and a window into another world that is better, safer, more profound and filled with more meaning than the one I currently inhabit. He keeps me company while on planes, on trains, in hotels, backstage, while I make dinner and during the lonely post-divorce nights.    I managed to wrangle a pre-release copy of Don Giovanni. It was meant to come out a year ago, but having recorded the whole thing and with it ready to go, Currentzis felt he could do better. And somehow he managed to convinced Sony to finance rerecording the entire opera. In Currentzisâ€™s hands, the orchestra makes sounds that Iâ€™ve never heard before and his singers are transported into world-class stars to rival Callas and Carreras. Thereâ€™s a moment early on in the opera â€“ Giovanniâ€™s Viva la libertÃ  â€“ that is in many ways the most important moment in all of art. Itâ€™s the fault line between classicism and romanticism, and Currentzis is one of the only musicians capable of fully understanding and transmitting the meaning of â€œlibertÃ â€.    â€˜By the end, we are almost in Hitchcock territory.â€™ Duncan Rock as Don Giovanni and Andrii Goniukov as the Commendatore in Glyndebourneâ€™s 2016 production of Don Giovanni. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian   Mozartâ€™s opera is about a young, arrogant, nobleman who shags his way around town, abuses and pisses off everyone else until he encounters something he cannot kill, beat up, dodge, or outwit â€“ a giant statue called the Commendatore, the murdered father of a woman Don Giovanni tried to rape. Giovanni killed him in a duel following the attack. He then makes a move on another woman he passes in the street after the attack, and goes on to try to seduce a young bride on her wedding day. His servant sings with glee that heâ€™s notched up 1,003 lovers which, pre-Tinder, is quite something. By the end, we are almost in Hitchcock territory. Mozart uses trombones to depict the statue, which wouldâ€™ve made his audience shit themselves because in his day no one used trombones other than in church. Itâ€™s terrifying. Itâ€™s full of dissonant sevenths and insane tension as the Don refuses to repent for his appalling life, despite the Commendatoreâ€™s ghost urging him to and giving him one last chance. But itâ€™s too late. The Don is dragged down to hell. Da Ponte, who wrote the lyrics, gives the simple stage direction: â€œFire on all sides; earthquake.â€ Which is kind of the master of understatement, and also perhaps a pretty decent description of how I feel about my life the majority of the time. Unwilling to end it there, where perhaps it would be most natural, Mozart, with his giant heart, allows us to end the opera with a sense of joy, wonder and transformation as the remaining cast rejoice at Don Giovanniâ€™s disappearance and the music moves into the major key with melody after melody pouring into us. Perhaps this reads like a sycophantic love letter to Currentzis. And although in many ways it is that, itâ€™s more an open thank you letter. Because within his recordings (and if opera really is not doable for you, listen to his version of Mozartâ€™s Requiem or Tchaikovskyâ€™s Violin Concerto or this Rameau track), there is an absolute meaning to life that has long eluded me. The other night I met a brilliant young theatre director and asked him if heâ€™d been approached about doing opera. He told me he had just recently been asked but that he wouldnâ€™t do it â€œbecause I really think opera is a dying art formâ€. Iâ€™m going to send him these box sets because I know heâ€™ll change his mind.  â€¢CosÃ¬ fan Tutte and Le Nozze di Figaro are available on Sony Classical. Don Giovanni is released on 4 November.",1
"The Israeli government has set itself on a collision course with international opinion â€“ and its own legal system â€“ after a ministerial committee voted unilaterally in favour of a bill to â€œlegaliseâ€ outposts Israel previously regarded as illegal. Critics say that if the proposed bill passes into law it will allow the â€œtheftâ€ of any Palestinian-owned land, while others, including those on the right, say it endangers Israelâ€™s international standing.  The vote by the ministerial committee for legislation on Sunday evening came despite the bill being opposed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, who described it as indefensible. While all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem are regarded as illegal by most of the international community, outposts built by hardline settlers without Israeli government approval have also been treated as illegal by Israel. The opposition leader, Isaac Herzog, said the proposed legislation was a â€œserious stain on Israel law books, because it authorises theft and robbery. There is no precedent, nothing like it, in which the Israeli government authorised a law that allows taking land from private people.â€ The Israeli anti-occupation group Yesh Din said in a statement: â€œThe regulation (outpost) bill approved today â€¦ is a legal stunt designed to legally sanction takeover of Palestinian land in the West Bank. â€œThis bill is discriminatory and authorises exploitation â€“ confiscation of Palestinian landownersâ€™ ability to make use of their land, denying them the right to appeal.â€ The proposed law must still pass the Knesset but Sundayâ€™s vote means it will have coalition support as it proceeds. It could still be challenged in court. The bill was one of two controversial pieces of legislation to be approved by the committee on Sunday. A second seeks to ban loudspeakers for the Muslim call to prayer.   Related: Trump has 'every intention' of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital   Both votes were condemned by the office of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, which said the leadership would go to the UN security council and â€œall international organisationsâ€ in order to stop them becoming law. The settlement vote â€“ which had already been postponed once â€“ was forced through by the justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, who is a member of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party led by Naftali Bennett, who has also been a prime mover behind the proposed law. Bennett welcomed the â€œhistoric process of authorising the settlements in Judea and Samariaâ€, using the Israeli terms for the occupied territories. However, Avigdor Lieberman, the defence minister who lives in a settlement himself, said the move was counter-productive following the election of Donald Trump in the US, who seems more settlement-friendly than his predecessor.  â€œAnyone who is fearful for the future of the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria understands that, at this moment, the most important thing is to coordinate our positions with the new American administration,â€ Lieberman said in a statement. â€œThis is the first time that a rightwing government in Israel has a Republican president, and a Republican majority in the Senate and Congress. Therefore we cannot create facts on the ground and embarrass the incoming administration. Everything must be agreed and coordinated.â€ The law has been pushed by Bennettâ€™s party to prevent the demolition and relocation of the controversial Amona outpost, which is built on seized private Palestinian land, and which a court had ordered to be knocked down just before Christmas. Founded in 1995, Amona is the largest of about 100 illegal outposts in the West Bank. When a partial removal of settlers was attempted a decade ago, it sparked violent clashes between settlers and Israeli security forces. The case of Amona has become a cause celebre for political backers of Israeli settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories, who have been given renewed vigour by the election of Trump last week. However, a legal opinion provided by Mandelblit found the proposed legislation would make it possible to confiscate private property, contrary to Israeli and international law. The vote pushes the long-running saga of Amona â€“ home to about 40 settler families â€“ back into the public eye. It has already been the subject of several court cases and various political machinations, and this move now appears to scotch a proposal to relocate the settlers. The ruling would apply to thousands of other housing units built on private Palestinian land. It also, said Mandelblit, threatened to create a constitutional crisis by attempting to overturn court rulings. Israeli media reports said some judicial officials had warned that the move would make Israel more vulnerable to action in international courts. Behind the votersâ€™ defiance of Netanyahu â€“ who is reported to believe the move will damage Israel â€“ is a tussle between his and Bennettâ€™s party to win over rightwing voters. In a separate development on Monday, Israelâ€™s supreme court rejected a government petition to postpone the court ordered demolition of Amona, further increasing the potential for tension over the issue, not least between ministers and the judiciary. Israelâ€™s continued expansion of settlement building has infuriated Palestinians and created friction with the Obama administration, which regards all settlement building as an obstacle to peace.

"A spokesman for Argentinaâ€™s president has denied that Donald Trump asked for a business favour when Mauricio Macri called the US president-elect to congratulate him on his victory. Local media reports have alleged that Trump asked Macri for help over a stalled construction permit for a 35-storey project called Trump Office in downtown Buenos Aires. A source told the Guardian that the information came from Macriâ€™s staff. â€œTrump asked him to authorize a building heâ€™s constructing in Buenos Aires â€“ it wasnâ€™t just geopolitical chat,â€ said journalist Jorge Lanata on his Sunday night news programme, Periodismo Para Todos. According the programme, the Buenos Aires building project became bogged down in bureaucratic red tape earlier this year, and was raised by Trump during the telephone call last Monday. â€œMacri told Trump that Argentina is welcoming foreign investment now, and Trump replied that he has a $150m investment in Argentina stalled because of a building permit in Buenos Aires,â€ journalist Romina Manguel, who described the alleged conversation on the programme, told the Guardian. Macriâ€™s spokesman, IvÃ¡n Pavlovsky, denied the report. â€œMacri did not speak to Donald Trump about the building of the tower,â€ he said. â€œThey only talked about continuing the relationship between the two countries and recalled their personal relationship from years ago.â€ Trump has insisted that he will not use the White House for personal profits, saying that after inauguration, he will let three of his children â€“Ivanka, Donald Jr and Eric â€“ run his business interests while he attends to the duties of commander in chief.   Related: Trump Towers Pune: project in sleepy Indian city faces investigation   But the Trump children are on his transition team and concerns have been raised that the president-elect is already mixing business interests and official duties.  The Economic Times reported that he met last week with business partners who are building Trump-branded apartments in India, while dozens of foreign diplomats reportedly attended a sales pitch last week at Trumpâ€™s new hotel in downtown Washington DC. Like Trump, Macri was born into a wealthy immigrant family, and the two leaders have had a long personal and business acquaintance. They first met in the 1980s when Macriâ€™s father, Francisco Macri, sold his stake in the Lincoln West housing and office development in New York to Trump. â€œThe Macri team had plenty of brainpower,â€ Trump wrote in his book The Art of the Deal, which dedicates a long section to his dealings with the father-and-son business tandem. â€œWhat they lacked was practical experience, especially in New York City, where it is so difficult to do any sort of real estate development.â€ In his own memoirs, Francisco Macri also described his business relationship with Trump, recalling how the real estate tycoon broke his golf clubs in frustration after Mauricio beat him in a golf game during a complicated business negotiation in the 1980s in New York. But despite such setbacks, the relationship remains close enough that President Macri spoke with Ivanka Trump during last Mondayâ€™s phone conversation. â€œIn the call, I also talked with his daughter,â€ Macri told the Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun. â€œI have known her since her infant days.â€ Macriâ€™s spokesman said that the Argentinian president did not discuss Trump Office with Ivanka Trump either.  â€œHe spoke with Ivanka only briefly to say hello because he met her when shewas just a kid,â€ the spokesman said. â€œThey did not speak about it. The president doesnâ€™t speak about city building permits.â€ Trump Office is slated to be built near the cityâ€™s landmark 235ft Obelisk, on 9 de Julio avenue, the widest avenue in the world. The project is in the hands of YY Development Group, an Argentinian real estate firm headed by lawyer and businessman Felipe Yaryura, who met Trump in 2011. The firm is also currently building Trump Tower Punta del Este, a luxury 157-apartment block in the Uruguayan beach resort of Punta del Este, playground for the rich and famous of both Argentina and Brazil. Although Yaryura was not available for comment, he has in several recent interviews said that he is especially close with Trumpâ€™s son Eric, who has visited Argentina a number of times. Yaryura believes Trumpâ€™s election will be good for Argentina because of the personal relationship between the two leaders. â€œThe personal relationship with Macri will have an influence, Trump has affection for Macri,â€ Yaryura told the daily ClarÃ­n earlier this month. â€œHeâ€™s always made complimentary comments about Macri.â€ Macri has worked hard to re-establish cordial relations with the US after they soured during the previous administration of populist president Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner.",1

"History offers strange consolation: No matter how alarming current events (or a presidential election) may be, historians can usually point to analogous episodes we survived in the past.So who better to consult about our imminent election than the Pulitzer-winning presidential historian and biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin and the MSNBC host and political commentator Rachel Maddow?Ms. Goodwin, 73, has written five critically acclaimed and best-selling presidential biographies, including â€œTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,â€ the basis, in part, for Steven Spielbergâ€™s film â€œLincolnâ€; â€œNo Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War IIâ€; and â€œLyndon Johnson and the American Dream,â€ which grew out of Ms. Goodwinâ€™s tenure as a White House fellow at age 24. She worked directly with President Johnson in his last year in office and later assisted him with his memoirs. Ms. Goodwin received her Ph.D. in government from Harvard.Ms. Maddow, 43, has hosted â€œThe Rachel Maddow Showâ€ weeknights on MSNBC since 2008. It is currently the networkâ€™s highest-rated program. Like other shows on MSNBC, it leans liberal. But Ms. Maddow has been praised by many for the civility with which she treats all guests, prioritizing information and context over the hysteria so often evident on cable news.She is the author of the best-selling book â€œDrift: The Unmooring of American Military Power.â€ Ms. Maddow earned a doctorate in politics from Oxford University, where she was a Rhodes scholar.Over an early lunch of eggs and toast at the Gotham Lounge in the Peninsula Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, a few days before the final presidential debate this month, the pair discussed the coming election in historical terms: the temperamental forebears of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump among our presidential ranks, the ambitions of candidates and their skills for the job.Philip Galanes: So, in terms of crazy, does this election have an historical peer?Rachel Maddow: For sure. Itâ€™s not like weâ€™ve never had a figure like Donald Trump in public life before.PG: Really?RM: Thereâ€™s some Huey Long there, and some P. T. Barnum. Some George Wallace.Doris Kearns Goodwin: Weâ€™ve had plenty of populist figures in our past, but they had a different degree of substance than Mr. Trump. William Jennings Bryan [the Democratic nominee for president in 1896, 1900 and 1908] came out of a period like today. The industrial revolution was like our tech revolution and globalization. The pace of life had sped up and made people anxious. Telegrams and telephones were fast. Immigration was huge. And Bryanâ€™s supporters, like Trumpâ€™s, were fearful about the way the country was changing.RM: Iâ€™m more interested in whether there are parallels for political parties falling apart. As Doris wrote in â€œThe Bully Pulpit,â€ our democracy unofficially depends on two major parties that can carry their own weight.DKG: This is where history can give us solace. When parties split up, as the Whigs did in the 1850s, over slavery, we got the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln, our greatest leader.PG: I feel better already.DKG: But then you have 1912, when Teddy Roosevelt decided to run against Taft. He knew that Taft had the Republican delegates, so he created the primary system: â€œLet the people rule!â€ It was democratic, no doubt about it. But the race was so vitriolic, it sounds like today. Taft calls Teddy a dictator; Teddy calls Taft a pinhead. And The New York Times says, â€œIf this is the first attempt at the primary system, we sincerely hope itâ€™s the last.â€PG: Has the temperament of a candidate ever been so center stage before?RM: In 1964, for sure. The bead on [Barry] Goldwater was that he was a nut. L.B.J. successfully characterized him as someone who couldnâ€™t be trusted with the nuclear codes.DKG: But itâ€™s come to the surface more today.RM: Maybe because we get more access to the president as a human being than we used to. With the White House photographer posting all those moments on Instagram. And so much attention on his family.DKG: Good point. Before, the candidates were leaders of one party or the other. The parties had platforms, and you were voting on what they promised you. You didnâ€™t really know them as human beings.PG: And is temperament just code for hotheaded?DKG: No, temperament is your basic orientation toward life. The Elizabethans boiled it down to four types: You were choleric or sanguine or melancholy or aggressive. You can be a good leader from any of them. Lincoln was melancholy, but what a president! Itâ€™s more to do with how you grow, how you learn from your mistakes.PG: How do you feel about Hillaryâ€™s guarded temperament?RM: I think itâ€™s a form of emotional maturity. It takes intellectual stamina to stay open, as a leader and a mind, to absorb information and adversity.DKG: And criticism. Thatâ€™s what Eleanor Roosevelt decided. When people were against her, it meant they were against her ideas, not against her personally. True or not, it gave her enormous leeway not to take criticism personally.RM: Thatâ€™s a form of strength.DKG: Where Trump goes wrong is when he says, â€œI have the best temperament of anyone whoâ€™s ever run for president â€” a winning temperament.â€ Thatâ€™s completely a-historical. Our best presidents have all gone through adversity. Whether itâ€™s Lincolnâ€™s suicidal depression, or Teddy Roosevelt losing his wife and his mother on the same day in the same house, or F.D.R. getting polio, they all went through trials by fire and emerged stronger for it. Nobody wins all the time.RM: Itâ€™s also too on the nose. You can never say, â€œI am humble.â€ You have disproved the assertion by saying it. Same with â€œbest temperament ever.â€PG: Which president does Hillary most remind you of?RM: Fascinating! Itâ€™s so hard not to factor gender. Which dude is she most like?DKG: It would have to be someone who had a lot of experience in different forms. Teddy Roosevelt probably came to the presidency with most experience: police commissioner, Civil Service commissioner, state legislator, governor, vice president, president. Bush Sr. also had a lot of title positions and brought an array of experiences.RM: But thereâ€™s often an alienation factor when people â€” like Hillary or Bush Sr. â€” come to you with all those experiences. Theyâ€™re no longer seen as a person to have a beer with. It makes it harder for people to empathize with them. I think George H. W. Bush suffered from that enormously.DKG: They become personages rather than people.PG: Have you met the candidates?RM: I met Hillary in a professional capacity. I interviewed her. But what happened off-camera was almost more interesting. I donâ€™t think of her as an extrovert, but when we were done, she met every single person on set, my entire staff, the whole floor, including the cleaning crew. Shook hands, took pictures. She was being kind to people who had an interest in her. But to see her do that, willingly, at the end of her 11th event of the day, that surprised me.PG: And Trump?RM: Iâ€™ve only spoken to Trump on the phone. He was warm and charming. I enjoyed talking to him. But a funny thing happened when I was negotiating with his staff. They insisted that the conversation was off the record. I could never even refer to the fact that it had happened. But at the end of it, Mr. Trump said: â€œWell, this has been a good conversation. You can run it.â€ I said: â€œIâ€™m not taping it. Your people said I couldnâ€™t even refer to it.â€ And he said, â€œThis wasnâ€™t on TV?â€PG: I bet youâ€™re a go-to person for candidates, Doris, with your presidential patina?DKG: I was on the radio when my Roosevelt book came out, talking about how most of the action takes place on the second floor of the White House. Roosevelt invited all these people to live with them during World War II: His foreign policy adviser moved in and never left; Lorena Hickok, who had a crush on Eleanor; Princess Martha from Norway. Winston Churchill would stay for weeks at a time. So, I said, â€œIâ€™m obsessed with all the great conversations they must have had in their bathrobes.â€It turned out that Hillary was listening. She was in the White House then. And she called me up at the radio station and said: â€œCome stay overnight at the White House, and we can figure out where everyone slept.â€ And she followed up on her promise. So, the president and Mrs. Clinton and my husband and I go through every room on the second floor with my map, and we figure it out. Bill and Hillary were sleeping where F.D.R. was. And my husband and I are in Winston Churchillâ€™s room. No way could I sleep â€” with Churchill in the corner, drinking his brandy and smoking his cigar.RM: Have you stayed in touch with Hillary over the years?DKG: Not for a while. I went to see her after they won the race in 1996. Chelsea was going off to school, and my kids had gone to college. We talked about missing them. And she told a funny story about Jackie Kennedy telling her which designers to wear. Hillary said, â€œClearly, Iâ€™m never figuring that out.â€ She was very open.RM: Does she seem different to you now?DKG: Oh, I donâ€™t know. Maybe a little more defensive. But my guess is that if sheâ€™s able to win, knowing: â€œIâ€™m the first female president of this country,â€ that is such a huge thing. Itâ€™s been totally overshadowed in this election. That would give her the confidence to say, â€œIâ€™m going to be like F.D.R. and meet the press twice a week.â€ She could get out of that insular world.PG: Letâ€™s stick with that: ambition and evolution. Most of us can track our ambitions in life to some childhood hurt: chilly parents, poverty. We work to overcome it. But when I talked with Jimmy Carter for this series, he spoke about a transformational moment â€” a political defeat and deep depression â€” that galvanized his desire to help all Americans. Does that happen with the great presidents?RM: You mean, they stop thinking about themselves and start thinking of the world?DKG: Without question. Lincoln was rare. He had it from the beginning. When heâ€™s 23 years old, heâ€™s already talking about leaving the world a better place for having lived in it. Franklin Roosevelt may have been president without polio. But once polio happened, he identified more with people whom fate had dealt an unkind hand. He was more empathetic than he would have been. Even L.B.J., who always had this strain of caring about ordinary people. He went for power after he lost the first senate race. Then he has an almost fatal heart attack in â€™55 and comes all the way back to his New Deal ambitions. He was more ready than we knew to be the liberal president.PG: How about your ambitions?DKG: My parents died when I was young â€” my mother of a heart attack when I was 15, my father when I was in my 20s. I think it made me want to tell stories of people who were dead to somehow bring them back to life. I didnâ€™t think about it at the time. But it is stories that keep people alive. Thatâ€™s where my ambition for history came from.RM: My ambitions were scattershot. Iâ€™ve never been a planner. I find myself with an opportunity and decide if I want to take it. Then I dig in. I just want to be good at it. And Iâ€™m more motivated by fear of failure than ambition to succeed.PG: But that makes sense for someone who started as an AIDS activist.RM: I grew up in the Bay Area, which was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic. And when I came out, it was a community that was fighting for survival. People my age and immediately older were dying. There arenâ€™t many circumstances in life, unless youâ€™re in the military, when you know a lot of people in your marching order who die before youâ€™re 25. Thatâ€™s humbling in terms of ambition.DKG: It does what Teddy Roosevelt did: It makes you want to do well whatever youâ€™re doing at that moment.RM: Because you donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s going to be another.PG: Itâ€™s the empathic crisis that Jimmy Carter talked about. Do you see that in Hillary or Trump?DKG: I see it in her. Thereâ€™s a doubleness of purpose there. Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re looking for in a good politician. Of course they want power. But you also hope that they want to do something with it. Thatâ€™s what L.B.J. said when he first got in: â€œIâ€™m not just going to strut to â€˜Hail to the Chief.â€™ I want to do something for poor people, for black people.â€ And when you look at what Hillaryâ€™s done through her career, itâ€™s been there, too. She needs to communicate that: not just what she did for children, but what she wants to do for all of us.PG: For a long time, I put irrational hatred of Hillary down to sexism.RM: Thereâ€™s some of that.PG: But hasnâ€™t it gotten worse? â€œLock her up! Lock her up!â€DKG: Hatred of â€œthe otherâ€ has grown exponentially. It started with the Clinton impeachment, then the hatred of Bush, then the hatred of Obama. I agree, itâ€™s of a different level when you say, â€œPut her in jail.â€ But once I was on â€œMeet the Press,â€ and they put up this demographic map that showed that people donâ€™t even want to live near people who think differently than they do.RM: Thatâ€™s a profound way to look at it. But thereâ€™s a simpler way: We saw the partisan hatred directed towards Bill and also Hillary Clinton when he was president. Now sheâ€™s getting Round 2. Nobody else gets Round 2.PG: At the beginning of the Trump phenomenon, I thought he was going to play it very â€œMorning in Americaâ€: â€œIâ€™ve got a zillion dollars and a million friends with a thousand ideas to make things better.â€ But it didnâ€™t go that way.DKG: Because heâ€™s so vulnerable underneath.RM: And itâ€™s turned very dark now that heâ€™s talking about Hillary Clinton and the cabal of global elites. I heard that speech before. It was translated.PG: And now the election rigging â€”â€”RM: But letâ€™s imagine Trump wins. Anything can happen. Is there anything about him that could be a good building block for a leader?DKG: You just have to hope. The worrisome thing is that we keep imagining that heâ€™s going to become presidential at some point, that heâ€™ll put behind him all the things he says about people, that he wonâ€™t react so personally. Then he keeps doing it.RM: One thing thatâ€™s underappreciated about Trump is his sense of humor.DKG: Where do you see this?RM: When he talks about how great he is, sometimes I think heâ€™s doing it in a self-deprecating way. And that makes me worry less about what seem to be his toxic insecurities.DKG: Well, he has been a master at breaking news.RM: Which is a kind of political genius, orchestrating coverage the way he has, if you donâ€™t care about seeming offensive or hurting your party.PG: Really?RM: Look, Iâ€™m not persuading you. Iâ€™m just trying to imagine him as president and prepare for it as a country.DKG: Thereâ€™s something about the office. In 2000, there was a fear that George W. Bush would never be a legitimate president. But he was, despite that incredible election and how it looked like it would shadow him. Something happens when they get in the presidency.RM: And the worry with George W. was not just legitimacy. It was whether he was mature enough and intelligent enough to do the job. Then he got in there and did it.DKG: He was a fuller person, we now know. Whether or not we agree with the decisions he made, he did fill the presidency. I guess thatâ€™s what you have to hope if Trump wins.PG: But look at how everyone is gripping the table.",1
"A day after the bank's record-breaking $42 billion merger with First Federal of Virginia, spokespersons for Midlantic Trust held a press conference Monday to assure Midlantic customers that they can still expect the same atrocious service they have always received in the past. 'Just because we've merged with First Federal doesn't mean we've changed,' Midlantic president Harlan Shore said. 'In the future, you can expect the same long lines, stand-offish tellers, and exorbitantly high loan rates you've come to count on here at Midlantic.' ",0
"On a recent evening, Craig Robinson, the actor and stand-up comedian known from the TV show â€œThe Officeâ€ and the movies â€œHot Tub Time Machineâ€ and â€œKnocked Up,â€ sat in Zum Schneider, a Bavarian beer garden in the East Village, practicing his German.â€œIch war verheiratet,â€ Mr. Robinson, 44, said to a young waitress who had grown up in Germany. â€œMeine frau ist gestorben.â€The waitressâ€™s eyes widened and her face softened in sympathy.The translation of Mr. Robinsonâ€™s howâ€™s-your-day small talk? â€œI was married. My wife passed away.â€Mr. Robinsonâ€™s German, it turns out, is limited to the dialogue he learned for his new movie, â€œMorris From America.â€ In the drama, which comes out Aug. 19 in select theaters (itâ€™s now available on DirecTV), he plays a single father who moves to Germany with his hip-hop-loving teenage son for a job. Stranded in the land of EDM and bratwurst, they learn to lean on each other in what becomes an affecting father-son story.The actor delivered his lines without cracking a smile. â€œI love the deadpan,â€ Mr. Robinson said of his trademark style. â€œItâ€™s such a strong go-to. It lets the audience make their own decisions about what youâ€™re thinking.â€After gaining fame as a comedic straight man, including as one of Judd Apatowâ€™s ensemble players, Mr. Robinson was drawn to the dramatic role in â€œMorris,â€ he said, because he loved the way the father relates to his son, in a hereâ€™s-the-straight-dope vernacular.But he almost didnâ€™t get the part because in a meeting with the director, his low-key manner was mistaken for uninterest.â€œHe said he didnâ€™t get the vibe that I wanted to be part of it,â€ Mr. Robinson said. â€œBut he couldnâ€™t have been more wrong.â€Working with funny, improvisational actors like Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, he said, teaches you to be a patient comedy opportunist. â€œYou have to hop in like a sniper,â€ Mr. Robinson said.He is a skilled comedic slayer at this point. He began his career as a stand-up in the mid-â€™90s, in his native Chicago. He worked as a schoolteacher and as a bouncer until his career got going. â€œAnd when I say I was a bouncer, Iâ€™d go get the bigger guys and say, â€˜Hey, theyâ€™re fighting,â€™â€ Mr. Robinson said.He won some comedy competitions, moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for movies, losing out on a role in â€œThe 40-Year-Old Virginâ€ but landing â€œKnocked Upâ€ and then â€œThe Office.â€At the beer garden, Mr. Robinson, dressed in a black Reebok T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, was low energy, though not strategically. He was simply tired after winding up a New York press tour for the new film, which included appearances on the â€œTodayâ€ show and â€œLate Night With Seth Meyers.â€ And he had just experienced the actorâ€™s version of a marathon: all-day back-to-back interviews with entertainment journalists.â€œNot one of them was a woman,â€ Mr. Robinson said with lament.Unlike his â€œMorrisâ€ character and Darryl Philbin, the divorced, unamused warehouse foreman he played in â€œThe Office,â€ Mr. Robinson has no children and has never been married.â€œIn L.A., I was dating this girl, and she moved in for a while,â€ he said. â€œThat ended bad. And now Iâ€™m just kind of fine.â€He does go home to two pet turtles, however.â€œTheyâ€™re just awaiting my presence,â€ he said, adding that when heâ€™s away for long periods, the turtles, Haag (there used to be a Dazs) and Priscilla, let their displeasure be known. â€œThey have a little attitude when I come home. They wonâ€™t eat the food I sit out right away.â€Mr. Robinson was flying home to Los Angeles the next morning. After relaxing at the beer garden, he planned to attend the premiere of â€œWar Dogs,â€ whose stars include his friend Mr. Hill.At the bar, he enjoyed his pilsner and the waves and smiles from strangers who recognized him, including a city bus driver who stopped, opened the bus door to yell, â€œHey, man!â€ and then closed the door and continued down Avenue C.After talking about doner kebab, a kind of street food he grew to like in Germany, he became nostalgic.â€œBerlin is where itâ€™s at, bro,â€ Mr. Robinson said. â€œI donâ€™t even party here, really. Something happens when I get out of the country. Berlin was all night long.â€Soon a black S.U.V. pulled up to take him to the film premiere. When he arrived at the theater, where photographers stood outside, Mr. Robinson instructed a reporter and photographer, â€œYou guys get out first.â€Seconds later, the car door opened and Mr. Robinson stepped out, luxuriating in the flashing cameras. Though it wasnâ€™t his movie, he looked, for a moment, like a dramatic leading man.",1
"Black Lives Matters Protestors Attack Clint Eastwood After He Does THIS [VIDEO] Last nights Oscars were fueled by racial tension. Host Chris Rock was quick to make jokes about the debate at any opportunity he got. We decided to look back at what a multiple Academy Award winner had to say about the controversy. Actor and director Clint Eastwood is no stranger to controversy, so it is no surprise that when he was asked about the all-white Oscar nomination debate, he gave a common sense answer without censoring in him. All I know is there are thousands of people in the Academy and a lot of themthe majority of themhavent won Oscars, Eastwood told interviewers at TMZ. Eastwood went on to confess that he did not follow the drama, but commented that a lot of people are crying, I guess. The controversy of the Oscars was first sparked when notorious race-baiter Al Sharpton noted that for the second year in the row, the Academy did not nominate a single African-American actor for an award. Ever since that comment was made, people in the industry have taken sides, with the most opinionated liberals boycotting the awards ceremony altogether. The Academy has responded to criticisms by announcing that it intends to work toward becoming less male and less white. What do you think of the debate and Eastwoods comments? Chris Rocks performance? ",0
"3D Printed and Homemade Ghost Guns Must Now Be Registered in CaliforniaBy Everett Numbers Governor Jerry Brown (D) signed Assembly Bill 857 into law on Friday, much to the chagrin of gun rights groups. Brown had vetoed similar legislation in 2014, according to the Sacramento Bee. I appreciate the authors concerns about gun violence, but I cant see how adding a serial number to a homemade gun would significantly advance public safety, Brown wrote two years ago, the Beereported. Enough has apparently changed in that time; while California Senate President pro-TemporeKevin de Lens (D-Los Angeles) 2014 bill failed, the 2016 version pushed by Assemblyman Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove) succeeded. In addition to requiring a background check through the states Department of Justice in order to obtain an official serial number, the builder of the homemade gun is prohibited from selling or transferring the weapon under the new law. It goes into full effect in 2019,according to the Associated Press. Proponents of the ghost gun regulations claimed that without the law, Californians would be endangered by felons or others barred from owning guns simply 3D printing or building their own. Gun rights advocates, however, see the law as only hurting non-criminals. In addition to many other terminal issues presented in the bill, AB 857 fails to conform its exemptions to federal law, thereby placing potentially hundreds of thousands of good, law-abiding people at the mercy of an unconstitutionally vague criminal statute, the Firearms Policy coalition argued in June before the bill was passed. The group issued another statement following the California legislatures approval of the bill. California gun owners will have to carefully weigh the risks of compliance before submitting to an openly tyrannical government that puts them and their Constitutionally-protected property in the crosshairs of a growing police state,the Firearms Policy Coalition said in a statement Friday. Before the new law was passed, unfinished lower receivers were made and sold to construct guns that would be legally untraceable. These parts usually consist of a trigger, firing pin, and an ammunition feeding mechanism.

"More and More States Deny Sharia Law In Court System Over the past few years, weve seen a dramatic increase in the number of the states taking action to protect their legal system from the implementation of Sharia Law. Of course, liberals argue that the move is an unnecessary one, designed to perpetuate discrimination against the Muslim population. Its hard to ignore the facts here. There is a reason why states like South Carolina are passing measures like H 3521, which excludes foreign law form being used in the state. The General Assembly finds that it shall be the public policy of this State to protect its citizens from the application of foreign lawswhen the application of foreign law will result in the violation of a right guaranteed by the Constitution of this State or of the United States, the bill reads. The measure was initially introduced by Rep. Chip Limehouse, who argues that it is necessary because Islamic law has, in fact, been used as a defense in South Carolinas courtrooms in the past. This goes to demonstrate that the South Carolina House of Representatives is committed to preserving and protecting the American way of life here in South Carolina, Limehouse told Breitbart. Sharia law cannot and will not be used as a legal defense in the state of South Carolina. What do you think? Do you support actions being taken to protect our Constitution?

"Star Wars, ancient Tibet, and Jedi trainingBy Jon Rappoport Yes, a director could take those pre-conditions and distort and strangle them in the making of a film, but without those elements the Star Wars movies wouldnt exist at all. Drilling down furtherThe Jedi, in whom the Force is naturally strong, undergo training. This factor pulses in the audiences subconscious, because it makes a kind of sense. If an individual can perform paranormal feats and control themhe needs to learn how. He needs to go to school. He needs to practice, as an athlete does. Perhaps the paranormal isnt just a childs fantasy. Maybe its more than that. Suppose it is. Suppose these societies we live in, these civilizations, are built to exclude such possibilities. Suppose, in the glorification of technology, an omission has occurredan intentional omission. Suppose a deadening realism is the arbitrary substitute for paranormal ability. Suppose this is a long con of immense obfuscation. Read Dean Radins classic, The Conscious Universe: Radin presents a compelling case via a far-reaching analysis of paranormal laboratory experiments and their results. When I first read his breakthrough book, I was floored. Far from merely recounting anecdotes of paranormal phenomena, Radin was proving that decades of well-formed and well-conducted published laboratory studies, in the areas of telepathy and psychokinesis, revealed that these human capabilities exist. He had performed a staggering feat. He had shown the science was valid. It remains for other branches of the scientific community to catch up, to admit their consensus about reality is provincial, distorted, and pathetically behind the times. They are now the Roman Church of old, denying Galileo and Bruno. Two years ago, Radin spoke at a conference, Electric Universe, in New Mexico. He described his recent pilot study on time and precognition. A small group of advanced meditators who use the non-dual technique, were tested. While meditating, they were subjected to random interruptions: a flash of light and a beeping sound. Measuring their brain activity, Radin found that significant brain changes occurred BEFORE the light flashes or the beeps. A control group of non-meditators were tested in exactly the same way, but their brain measurements revealed NO such changes. In other words, the brains of the meditators anticipated the timing of the unpredictable interruptions. The future was registering now. This, of course, opens up another way of thinking about time. Serial time, the idea that, in this continuum, we experience a smooth progression of moments, with the present becoming, so to speak, the future, is the conventional view. But suppose that is a grossly limiting and sketchy premise? Suppose that, for those who can be aware of it, the future is bleeding into the present? It is making an impact before it happens. If time is deeply rooted in perception, Dean Radins study indicates that this perception extends to the future. If people can register the impact of the future now, then our notions of time are up for grabs. So are conventional concepts of cause and effect, which rely on chains of events moving like trains from the past to the present. We need to consider that causes can sit in the future and produce their effects in the present. In which case, what is the future? It certainly is an expanded territory that extends beyond our normal notions of it. In correspondence with me, Dean Radin offered further information about his study: All participants knew that they would receive a light flash, an audio tone [beep], both, or none. In one condition they didnt know when these would occur or what type of stimulus. In another condition they knew when it would occur but not what. In all cases no one, including [the scientist] experiment[ers], knew what the next stimulus would be because we used a true random number generator to select it on the fly. The conclusion of the study was that the reported subjective experience of exceptional spaciousness, or timelessness, reported by some advanced meditators, appears to be objectively correct. That is, their subjective sense of now appears to expand substantially, and our experiment indicates that this was not an illusion. I then asked Dr. Radin how closely correlated the light flashes and audio tones were to the brain changes in the meditators. His answer was stunning. The brain changes occurred 1.5 seconds before these interruptions. And the changes obviously occurred even though some of the meditators didnt know when the interruptions were coming. Radins remarks offer us a major point: these meditators were expanding their consciousness of the present moment, so that it included the future. Such a framework of understanding travels far beyond modern ideas about the makeup and laws of the physical universe. It implies more than merely a holographic or pixel-based cosmos. It speaks to titanic capabilities on our part. Of course, having sunk to a state in which we navigate in an amnesia about ourselves, we look at these ideas with skepticism. We pretend we are trapped in a container-continuum of space and time, as Einstein and others have fleshed it out. Consider what could be the most astonishing extension of Dean Radins work: suppose that for those elements of the future that arent yet planned or on the drawing boards at all, people can still register their presence in advance. Then we would be talking about the human capacity to reach out into a vacuum, a nothing, and still bring back what is going to happen. Back to Star Wars. Jedi undergo training to improve their ability to see into the immediate future, to know, in advance, what is about to happen seconds before it doesfor example, in battle against an opponent. In this sense, that process mirrors what Radin has been researching and confirming. Is it any surprise that the movie audience feels a resonance with Jedi abilities? We are talking about more than just fantasy wish-fulfillment. Another kind of training existed in early Tibet. Those Jedi utilized a method of visualization that, in its concept, challenges virtually all systems of spiritual practice. (Read John Blofelds wonderful book, The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet.) Im talking about deity visualization. The student is given a task: create in his mind, in every detail, the image of a specific deity. I believe these students were given a painting to study in this regard. This was no brush-off exercise. The student, in isolation, had to create, all at once, with no missing parts, and sustain the entire (fully and extensively decorated) image. If he could accomplish this at all, it might take months, or even years. If he achieved the goal, the deity would then naturally take on the persona of a counselor, guide, and friend. For the student, this would be a marvelous ongoing experience. The teacher, watching the student closely, would determine when he was relying too closely on the guide. At that point, he would tell the student: Get rid of the deity. This, it was said, was more difficult than creating it in the first place. But if the student could achieve both the creation and destruction of the deity, he would then see, as John Blofeld puts it, that the universe is a product of mind. This insight, not merely an intellectual conclusion, but an immediate knowing and experience, would enable the student to change, rearrange, and recreate physical space, time, and energy. The early Tibetan school of the paranormal was undoubtedly the most original in the history of the planet. It also speaks to the idea that, through training, through the development of the faculty of imagination, the individual can regain and restore what was originally his, before socialization, indoctrination, and realism submerged his own power. The Star Wars films reinstate the concept of the advanced academy, where students actually train to enhance their inherent capacities. Therefore, the movies are more than spectacles. They firmly suggest that training, if it existed, would be the key to outdistancing the programmed and illusory dimensions of the world people believe they live in. The films reawaken the idea of individual powernot as some bedraggled tag-end appendage going extinct as a result of higher social evolution, but as a primary alive and electric core that has been stepped on and rejected by engineers of a mass future, in which individuals are supposed to be numbers and units and ciphers in a dimmed-out gray utopia, for the sake of some misbegotten counterfeit of universal justice and equalityneither of which, when the veneer is peeled away, is just or equal. There, for those who can see, is the illusion. The reality is the individual, alive and awake with his amnesia stripped away, and his power intact. Again.

"Taiwan share prices closed down 0.45 percent Thursday as the high-tech sector continued to see profit taking, while select old economy stocks remained resilient, preventing the broader market from falling further, dealers said. The weighted index fell 34.95 points to 7,666.34, after moving between 7,665.78 and 7,718.92, on turnover of NT$87.54 billion (US$2.72 billion). The market opened little changed, down 1.93 points, and rotational buying in old economy stocks led the index to the day's high before profit taking in select electronics emerged to reverse the early gains after U.S. electronics stocks fell overnight. A total of 1,731 stocks closed down and 1,378 finished higher, while 354 remained unchanged. The biggest drop was in the construction sector which fell 0.7 percent. The financial, and machinery and electronics sectors closed each closed 0.6 percent lower, while the plastics and chemical sector fell 0.5 percent and the textile sector lost 0.2 percent. The paper and pulp sector rose 1.1 percent, the foodstuff sector gained 0.7 percent and cement sector added 0.6 percent. Wall Street moved lower overnight after Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economic outlook remained 'unusually uncertain.' 'Despite the fall, the selling in the local bourse was not intolerable,' Concord Securities analyst Allen Lin said. 'Bernanke's comments did have some impact on the market here. But, the impact was limited as many investors expect the moderate growth rate of the global economy in the second half of this year,' Lin said. Lin said Thursday's selling focused on large cap high tech stocks amid earnings uncertainty before they report next week on their second quarter results. 'While that uncertainty remains, the high tech sector and even the broader market is expected to continue in a consolidation mode,' Lin said. Integrated circuit designer MediaTek dropped 1.95 percent to NT$453.00, flat panel AU Optronics fell 1.35 percent to NT$29.30 and smartphone maker HTC lost 0.89 percent, falling to NT$555.00. United Microelectronics Corp. fell 1.01 percent to NT$14.65, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed 0.32 percent higher at NT$62.00. While some old economy stocks were boosted by rotational interest to lend some support to the broader market, Lin said their strength failed to help the index emerge from the current narrow range. Oceanic Beverages rose 6.95 percent to NT$25.40 and Taiwan Cement gained 2.74 percent to reach NT$28.10. ",1
"While revelations about  Russian involvement in the American presidential election rock the United States, there are ominous signs that Russia is spreading propaganda and engaging in cyberattacks in Europe in advance of several national elections next year.In 2017, Germany, France and the Netherlands will hold elections. It is also possible that Italy will move elections scheduled for 2018 forward in the wake of the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi after voters rejected a referendum on constitutional reforms this month. Candidates who are right-wing populists and friendly toward Russia are gaining ground across Europe, thanks, in part, to Russian interference along the lines of what Moscow was accused of doing in the United States. Russiaâ€™s goals in Europe appear to be to elect foreign leaders who are sympathetic to Russian expansionism, to weaken NATO and to fan anti-European Union forces.In France, Marine Le Penâ€™s National Front party benefited in 2014 from an $11.7 million Kremlin loan to help finance its campaigns. And the winner of the center-right Les RÃ©publicains partyâ€™s recent primary elections, FranÃ§ois Fillon, has called for lifting sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and its war in Ukraine, and for working  with Russia to curb immigration and prevent terrorism.In the Netherlands, Geert Wildersâ€™s populist Party for Freedom has surged, with   a Donald Trump look-alike â€œMake the Netherlands Great Againâ€ campaign, which is anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim. Mr. Wilders is calling for an exit from the European Union. Matteo Salvini of Italyâ€™s anti-immigrant Northern League opposes sanctions on Russia and boasts of his trips to Moscow.Germany is a prime target of interference: Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is running for re-election, has stood strong on defending liberal values, the unity of Europe and sanctions against Russia. Germanyâ€™s intelligence agency has concluded that Russia was very likely behind the hacking of the Parliamentâ€™s computer network in 2015, and suspicion is high that it is also behind an attack last month that cut internet and telephone service for 900,000 Germans.There is strong evidence that Russia played a role in the defeat of the Italian referendum, as well as in the Brexit vote in June and a Dutch referendum in April in which voters rejected a treaty to strengthen ties between the European Union and Ukraine. The best way to ensure that Russia doesnâ€™t replicate these successes in elections next year is to expose its tactics before voters head to the polls. As Chancellor Merkel put it: â€œCyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point.â€The future of Western democracies may depend on the success of Ms. Merkelâ€™s approach, and on how vigorously other liberal European leaders follow her lead.",1

"One of the biggest insurance companies in Britain is to use social media to analyse the personalities of car owners and set the price of their insurance. The unprecedented move highlights the start of a new era for how companies use online personal data and will start a debate about privacy.  Admiral Insurance will analyse the Facebook accounts of first-time car owners to look for personality traits that are linked to safe driving. For example, individuals who are identified as conscientious and well-organised will score well.    Related: Facebook forces Admiral to pull plan to price car insurance based on posts   The insurer will examine posts and likes by the Facebook user, although not photos, looking for habits that research shows are linked to these traits. These include writing in short concrete sentences, using lists, and arranging to meet friends at a set time and place, rather than just â€œtonightâ€. In contrast, evidence that the Facebook user might be overconfident â€“ such as the use of exclamation marks and the frequent use of â€œalwaysâ€ or â€œneverâ€ rather than â€œmaybeâ€ â€“ will count against them. The initiative is called firstcarquote and was officially meant to launch this week but that was delayed at the last minute on Tuesday night. It is aimed at first-time drivers or owners â€“ although anyone with a licence can apply. The scheme is voluntary, and will only offer discounts rather than price increases, which could be worth up to Â£350 a year. However, Admiral has not ruled out expanding firstcarquote. The rapid growth of social media and personal technology has given insurance companies and employers swaths of data they can access to analyse customers or employees. As well as Admiralâ€™s car insurance scheme, insurers are looking at how they can use the rise of smartwatches and fitness trackers to monitor peopleâ€™s health. For example, Vitality is currently selling the Apple Watch to health and life insurance customers, with the final price dependent on how much exercise customers do while owning the watch. Admiral says that firstcarquote offers a way for young drivers to identify themselves as safe rather than having to wait years while they build up a track record and a no claims bonus.   Related: Alarmed by Admiral's data grab? Wait until insurers can see the contents of your fridge   Dan Mines, who led the firstcarquote project at Admiral, denied that it was invasive of personal data. â€œIt is incredibly transparent. If you donâ€™t want to use it in a quote then you donâ€™t have to,â€ he said. â€œWe are doing our best to build a product that allows young people to identify themselves as safe drivers.â€ Mines said Admiral could eventually develop the scheme further, meaning it could include other social media sites and increase the price of insurance for some drivers. â€œThis is very much a test product for us. This is innovative, it is the first time anyone has done this,â€ he said. â€œIt is a test, this is early days. The data will only ever provide a discount. We will work through that and learn more. â€œI think the future is unknown. We donâ€™t know if people are prepared to share their data. If we find people arenâ€™t sharing their data, then we wonâ€™t ever get to consider that [expanding firstcarquote].â€ The scheme is based around algorithms that have been developed by Admiral. The technology uses social data to make a personality assessment and then, judging against real claims data, analyse the risk of insuring the driver. Yossi Borenstein, the principal data scientist on firstcarquote, said its algorithm looked for correlations between social media data and actual claims data. The technology will evolve as firstcarquote attracts customers and gathers more evidence about the correlations, meaning the importance of items identified on social media could change. Borenstein said: â€œJust like conscientiousness there are other traits which can be indicative of safe driving. Our algorithm for calculating what â€˜safeâ€™ looks like is constantly learning, as we match social data to actual claims data.  â€œOur analysis is not based on any one specific model, but rather on thousands of different combinations of likes, words and phrases and is constantly changing with new evidence that we obtain from the data. As such our calculations reflect how drivers generally behave on social media, and how predictive that is, as opposed to fixed assumptions about what a safe driver may look like.â€ Borenstein insisted that Admiral would not have access to information about what its customers look at on Facebook or what their friends do. The company would only have access to the information gathered during the quote process and would have no ongoing access. â€œIf this is successful, it could be revolutionary,â€ he said. â€œIt could be truly transformational.â€ An Admiral spokesman said: â€œThe launch of our firstcarquote trial has had to be delayed. Weâ€™ve been working closely with Facebook in Europe to get the service ready, and are now addressing a few outstanding issues. We hope that very soon we will be able to offer first-time drivers better deals on their car insurance.â€",1
"To the Editor:Re â€œBus Passengers Deserve a Safe Rideâ€ (editorial, March 14):While I completely agree that bus passengers, like passengers of any mode of transportation, deserve a safe ride, that is already happening today. The Department of Transportation, the National Transportation Safety Board and others have consistently noted that intercity bus transportation is extremely safe compared with other modes of travel.It has been well documented that when there are accidents that lead to fatalities, in at least half of those situations, an illegal or marginally safe company was responsible.The misleading perception that The Times seems to regularly advance is that there is a correlation between offering a discount or conducting a marketing strategy highlighting lower fares to attract riders and unsafe operations. There is absolutely no such correlation.Many safety enhancements, as recommended by the N.T.S.B., are supported by the industry and have been included in modern motor coaches. However, the first priority should be to ensure that all companies operating motor coaches make safety their top priority.It is unsafe bus operators that directly equate to unsafe travel. It is the role of the federal government and state enforcement officials to weed out these few â€œbad actorsâ€ so that the public can be assured that the coaches they ride will get them safely to their destination.In recent years, the Department of Transportation has conducted targeted enforcement of many illegal companies operating in and around New York City and has improved scrutiny of new companies coming into the business. We support those efforts. Nonetheless, the department still seems to be more interested in examining the good companies over and over rather than doing the more difficult investigative work needed to weed out the bad apples in the industry.PETER J.

"Noting that there was definitely a chill in the air, law enforcement officials confirmed Thursday that conditions were too nippy to continue search and rescue operations for Kyle Higgins, a 27-year-old hiker who has been missing for two days. While we remain committed to finding this young man, the breeze is currently too crisp to carry out further rescue efforts, and our EMT units face the very real risk of getting the shivers, said Eagle County sheriff Jeff Hagedorn, who confirmed reports that you could see your breath outside, prompting him to suspend the search for the next 24 hours. Unfortunately, even with the precautions of bundling up in pullovers and wool mittens, we dont have the layering necessary to keep sufficiently toasty right now. Its just too darn brisk out there. The sheriff added that he hoped the fatigued, hungry, and possibly injured hiker could find a cozy little spot in the 400-square-mile expanse of wilderness and stay nice and snug until help arrived.

"Black Friday: Shocking Brexit Vote Result Causes The 9th Largest Stock Market Crash In U.S. HistoryBy Michael Snyder The shocking outcome of the Brexit vote caught financial markets completely off guard, and the carnage that we witnessed on Friday was absolutely staggering Stocks of some British-based banks suffered double-digit lossesin heavyU.S. trading. Barclays (BCS) shares plunged 20.48% to close at $8.89.HSBC (HSBC)shares closed down 9.04% at $30.68.Andshares of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) plummeted 27.5%to a $5.43 close. Top U.S. banks also suffered from the Brexit fallout, although not as badly as their British counterparts. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) closeddown6.95% at$59.60.Bank of America (BAC) shares fell 7.41% to a $13 close. Citigroup (C) shares dropped 9.36%to close at $40.30. And Wells Fargo (WFC) closed4.59% lower at$45.71. But please dont think that Black Friday was just a one-day thing. As I warned before, the Brexit vote could be the trigger that changes everything. And if you dont believe me on this, perhaps you will listen to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. This is what hetold CNBC on Friday This is the worst period, I recall since Ive been in public service, Greenspan said on Squawk on the Street. Theres nothing like it, including the crisis remember October 19th, 1987, when the Dow went down by a record amount 23 percent? That I thought was the bottom of all potential problems. This has a corrosive effect that will not go away. I completely agree with Greenspan on this point. This corrosive effect on global markets is not going to go away any time soon. Sure there will be days when the markets are green just like there were after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but overall the trend will be down. Now that the United Kingdom has decided to leave the EU, financial markets have been gripped by fear and uncertainty, and there is a great deal of concern that this Brexitcould harm the economies of everyone involved Important British trading partners including India and China indicated they were worried that an exit would create regulatory and political volatility that could harm the economies of everyone involved. The U.K.s Treasury itself reported that its analysis showed the nation would be permanently poorer if it left the EU and adopted any of a number of likely alternatives. Productivity and GDP per person would be lower in all these alternative scenarios, as the costs would substantially outweigh any potential benefit of leaving the EU, a summary of the report said. This threat even extends to the United States.CNN just published an article that lists four ways the U.S. could be significantly affected by all of this Fortunately we are now heading into the weekend, and that might have a calming effect on the markets. Or it might just cause financial tension to build up to an extremely high level which will subsequently be released on Monday morning. We shall see. RCBs Charlie McElligott is warning that Black Friday was just the beginning and that today is the appetizer for Monday. And UBS derivatives strategist Rebecca Cheong says that we could see more than a hundred billion dollars of selling over the next two to three trading days Strategies designed to mitigate risk will actually add to downward pressure in the SP 500 over the next week as computerized selling ramps up to keep pace with falling prices. It reminds Cheong of the rapid stock selling that roiled markets in August, when the SP 500 fell 11 percent to a 10-month low while facing similar behavior from algorithmic traders. The bigger the down move today, the more they have to sell, which would basically create a vicious cycle, Cheong, head of Americas equity derivatives strategy at UBS, said in a phone interview. Well see front-loaded selling in the range of $100 billion to $150 billion over the next two to three days. It could be very similar to August in terms of model-based selling. Personally, I am hoping for calm when the markets open on Monday. But without a doubt, something has now shifted as a result of this Brexit vote, and things have suddenly become a whole lot more serious. So what do you believe we will see happen next week? Please feel free to tell us what you think by posting a comment below *About the author: Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog. Michaels controversial new book about Bible prophecy entitled The Rapture Verdict is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.* The more they emphasize the crash and the shock, the more this sounds phony to me. They are always prepared for an opposite outcome!! That is how to eliminate what the people wanted. You can see headlines Brexit illegal and non binding! My crystal ball says oh, its foggy. Ah, you worthless POS. Youre going back to Amazon. Anyway, my optimystic side thinks there may be a rough period which includes more countries leaving the EU which will eventually result in the total collapse of the EU followed by a new beginning. My pessimistic side says it was planned this way all along to bring in the end times. This is my take on the whole thing. Firstly the German and French markets took the biggest hits on Friday not the British. German and France had a approx. 9% down turn each. The market turmoil will prevail for a month or two then stabilize. The pound has dropped but that might help with their exports. Some banks might fail like the Deutsche Bank. As more countries leave the EU then the market turmoil will become more of a worry. Already we see France and Germany calling for referendums to exit and also we may expect minor EU members like Greece, Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary want to exit too over time. Like Tuaca I think this is a See I told you this would happen moment played out by TPTB to try and prove a point that the leave campaign would create turmoil. And like Bleak I think this is all set up to bring in a new world currency system mentioned back in 1988 in the Economist magazine titled Get Ready For A World Currency by 2018. It is now up to us activists to make the sheeple aware of this and to try and circumvent this from happening. Stopped at I completely agree with Greenspan. Snyder has always been a staunch Gloom and Doomer, all precious metal pushers are, but now I know hes also a cabal mouthpiece. Tsk tsk AP. Great Britain! I hope the entire banking system collapses and the bankers find a long walk off of a short peir. I wonder what happened in Iceland? They bit the bullet for a couple years after they arrested the banksters and decided not to join the EU. I think theyre doing pretty good now. Friday I almost made back my loses from 2008. I wonder how my friends did that kept saying I was crazy? LOL Theyll have to call there brokers. I Knew as soon as I got home sat. morning. The globalists are loosing control! Now the payback begins, and then the jail time for them thieving rats! ",0
"The Association of Football Agents has said that â€œthe global move to deregulation has not workedâ€ and has â€œallowed the system to be more open to manipulation and abuseâ€ amid the fallout from Sam Allardyceâ€™s resignation. In a statement issued on Wednesday it also stressed the need for tighter regulation of its industry, featuring input from Uefa and Fifa.   Related: Sam Allardyce sting: agent Mark Curtis has history of controversy   The board of the body that represents more than 300 agents gathered in London and expressed a willingness to bring greater light to bear on financial transactions in football. The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday cited undercover interviews with agents in which they claimed to have given bungs to Premier League and Championship managers to help seal transfer deals. In a statement, the AFA said: â€œWe recognise that while recent reports involving possible misconduct in relation to player transfers remain unproven, they do raise important questions and serve to highlight the need for greater transparency and a new regulatory framework in this area of the football industry. â€œWe are totally committed to helping any investigation in the various allegations,â€ the AFA continued, â€œand to continue to work with the relevant football authorities, led by the FA, to further explore what steps can be taken in English football to put in place an effective system of licensing and code of conduct for agents.â€ The AFA called for a system that is â€œenforceable globallyâ€ and criticised the deregulation of agent licensing and conduct by Fifa in April of last year. It gathered ostensibly to welcome a new chairman, the former chief executive of the International Rugby Board Mike Miller, to replace Mel Stein. It is understood that Miller sees it as part of his responsibilities to lift some of the shadows that have hung over football agents and to aim not only for greater accountability for the industry but transparency too. Quite how far such transparency will go remains to be seen however, with commercial sensitivities making it unlikley that full disclosure of the fees involved in transfer deals will occur.

"Anarchy Along The Jersey Shore And On Long Island In The Aftermath Of Hurricane SandyMichael Snyder, Contributor At the moment, there are still approximately 4.7 million homes and businesses that do not have power. Officials say that some of those homes and businesses may not have their power restored until the weekend of November 10th and 11th. Meanwhile, it is getting very cold at night. This weekend the low temperatures on Long Island are supposed to dip into the upper thirties. There have been reports of people diving into dumpsters behind supermarkets in a desperate search for food, and there have been other reports of roaming gangs of criminals posing as officials from FEMA or Con Edison and then robbing families at gunpoint once they have gained entrance into their homes. If people will behave like this during a temporary emergency that lasts only a few days, what would they do during a total economic collapse? That is a frightening thing to think about. Most gas stations along the Jersey shore and on Long Island are either totally out of gasoline or they dont have any power to operate the gas pumps. It is estimated that more than half of all gas stations in New York City are closed at the moment, and officials say that more than 80 percent of all gas stations in New Jersey are not able to sell gas right now. So needless to say, the lines at the gas stations that remain open are horrific. The following is how one New Jersey mayor described the situation There have even been reports of people literally fighting each other over gasoline According to Breitbart, there have been continuous reports of fistfights and people bringing guns to gas stations on Twitter. The following are a couple of examples Unfortunately, authorities are projecting that the gas shortage may last for another week at least. How angry and frustrated will people get by that time? There are vast stretches of the Jersey Shore and the coast of Long Island that will never be the same again. The following is an excerpt from a comment that a reader of mine from Long Island left on one of my recent articles This was not just another storm. It was a life-altering event for millions of people. Unfortunately, just as we have seen after every other major storm in recent years, looters are taking advantage of the chaos caused by Hurricane Sandy. According to the New York Post, a number of arrests for looting have already been made on Long Island Over on Coney Island, looting appeared to be out of control during the immediate aftermath of the storm Amazingly, a number of not-so-smart looters have actually been displaying their looted goods on Twitter. Just check out the shocking photos in this article. But most people living in the areas that were most affected by Hurricane Sandy are decent people that just want some assistance. One resident of Hoboken, New Jersey became so frustrated that he inflated an air mattress and used it to float down to city hall in an attempt to get some answers Just like we saw after Hurricane Katrina, the response by the federal government and by big aid agencies such as the Red Cross has been very slow. In fact, Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro has gone so far as to call the Red Cross an absolute disgrace and is urging people that live in his area to quit giving money to them If this is how angry and frustrated that people become over a temporary disaster, how angry and frustrated would they get if there was a total economic meltdown that was permanent? Sadly, the truth is that what we are seeing during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is just a very small preview of what is coming on a national level. Our economy is a complete and total mess right now, and things are going to get a whole lot worse. And as we are seeing along the Jersey Shore and on Long Island right now, desperate people do desperate things. Hopefully Hurricane Sandy will serve as a wake-up call for millions of American families. Time is definitely running out, and we all need to get prepared while we still can.

"Obamas Grandmother Admits That He Was Born In Kenya A clip of audio footage has surfaced lately, showing Barack Obamas own grandmother admitting that the President of the United States was actually born in Kenya. During the telephone interview, Sarah Obama clearly articulates that she was present at Baracks birth. She also admits that it took place in Kenya. Keep in mind that the interview was conducted in 2008, before Obama had won his Presidency. It is possible that Sarah had not yet been told to cover up the presidents true country of origin. In fact, in later interviews, Sarah is seen promising that Barack was born in the United States. What do you think of the clip? Listen below and share your thoughts. ",0

"Is the CDCs Mandated Vaccine Schedule a Health-Disguised Compulsory Sterilization Program?William Davies But surgery is not necessary to sterilize. During WWII, the Nazis experimented on people at Auschwitz to develop vaccines that sterilize at routine doctors appointments under the guise of medical treatment. In July 1942 Lieutenant General Rudolf Brandt, Himmlers personal advisor (Strzelecka 1996), contacted Clauberg, asking on behalf of Himmler, [how long it would take] to sterilize 1000 Jewesses. The Jewesses themselves should not know anything about it. As the SS Reich Leader [Himmler] understands it, you could give the appropriate injection during a general examination. This use of vaccines to sterilize continued beyond WWII, including under the aegis of WHO, where the intent was hidden. since the 1920s the Rockefeller Foundation had funded the eugenics research in Germany through the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institutes in Berlin and Munich, including well into the Third Reich. They praised the forced sterilization of people by Hitler Germany, and the Nazi ideas on race purity. It was John D. Rockefeller III, a life-long advocate of eugenics, who used his tax free foundation money to initiate the population reduction neo-Malthusian movement through his private Population Council in New York beginningin the 1950s. From Eugenics and the Nazis the California Connection by Edwin Black California led the nation, performing nearly all sterilization procedures with little or no due process. In its first 25 years of eugenics legislation, California sterilized 9,782 individuals, mostly women. Many were classified as bad girls, diagnosed as passionate, oversexed or sexually wayward. At the Sonoma State Home, some women were sterilized because of what was deemed an abnormally large clitoris or labia. In 1933 alone, at least 1,278 coercive sterilizations were performed, 700 on women. The states two leading sterilization mills in 1933 were Sonoma State Home with 388 operations and Patton State Hospital with 363 operations. Other sterilization centers included Agnews, Mendocino, Napa, Norwalk, Stockton and Pacific Colony state hospitals. Even the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed aspects of eugenics. In its infamous 1927 decision, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote, It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind . . . Three generations of imbeciles are enough. This decision opened the floodgates for thousands to be coercively sterilized or otherwise persecuted as subhuman. In 1967 the American Public Health Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists conducted a study and found that 54 percent of the teaching hospitals nation-wide made sterilization a requirement for winning approval for an abortion (Weisbord, 1975: 155). A Look at the Indian Health Service Policy of Sterilization, 1972-1976 by Charles R. England In 1970, George H W Bush authored the Family Planning Act which funded the sterilization of Native American women. Engdahl continues about Bill Gates and the WHO and sterilization by vaccine: The idea of using vaccines to covertly reduce births in the Third World is also not new. Bill Gates good friend, David Rockefeller and his Rockefeller Foundation were involved as early as 1972 in a major project together with WHO and others to perfect another new vaccine. The results of the WHO-Rockefeller project were put into mass application on human guinea pigs in the early 1990s. The WHO oversaw massive vaccination campaigns against tetanus in Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines. Comite Pro Vida de Mexico, a Roman Catholic lay organization, became suspicious of the motives behind the WHO program and decided to test numerous vials of the vaccine and found them to contain human Chorionic Gonadotrophin, or hCG. That was a curious component for a vaccine designed to protect people against lock-jaw arising from infection with rusty nail wounds or other contact with certain bacteria found in soil. The tetanus disease was indeed, also rather rare. It was also curious because hCG was a natural hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy. However, when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier, it stimulated formation of antibodies against hCG, rendering a woman incapable of maintaining a pregnancy, a form of concealed abortion. Similar reports of vaccines laced with hCG hormones came from the Philippines and Nicaragua. In 1974, Henry Kissinger wrote National Security Council Document 20506: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests This 1974 memorandum drafted by Henry Kissinger led directly to the unleashing of experimental vaccines on the unsuspecting public. It sighted countries as targets for initial population reduction experimentation to be implemented around the year 2000. They identified India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia Columbia for study. 3 million Filipinos ages 12-48 were given a test vaccine that ruined their health. North American Black Native American Women were each given the same vaccine resulting in sterility rates of 25% 35% respectively. The directive came from the WHO and was directly tied to Kissingers report. [Emphasis added.] http://www.scribd.com/doc/6474391/Henry-Kissinger-Population-Control Documenthttp://www.danielestulin.com/ver.php?id=160 http://www.danielestulin.com/ver.php?id=161 George Bush between 2000 and 2008 politicized and undermined the US science agencies, including the CDC which is closely tied to the vaccine manufacturers. Robert Kennedy Jr. wrote about the Junk Science created because of Bush. As a favor to utility and coal industries, Americas largest mercury dischargers, the EPA sat for nine months on a report exposing the catastrophic impact on childrens health of mercury, finally releasing it in February 2003. Among the findings of the report: The bloodstream of one in twelve US women is saturated with enough mercury to cause neurological damage, permanent IQ loss and a grim inventory of other diseases in their unborn children. The CDC has been lying since 2001 about the relation between mercury and autism, reporting that mercury in vaccines has no impact on children. There is mercury in the flu vaccines and some of the mandated vaccines for American children (who get 2-3 times more vaccines than any other children in the world). The CDC has known for over a decade that there was a connection between mercury and autism and FOIAs show that the CDC colluded in covering up the link between autism and mercury. The Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs (CoMeD) exposes communications between Centers for Disease Control (CDC) personnel and vaccine researchers revealing U.S. officials apparently colluded in covering-up the decline in Denmarks autism rates following the removal of mercury from vaccines. . In the final draft version of the publication submitted to Pediatrics, the data from 2001 showing a decline in autism was not mentioned. Ignoring this omission, the CDC continued to endorse the article and, in a December 10, 2002 recommendation letter to the editor of Pediatrics, encouraged expedited review and publication of the article. The misleading Danish article was published by Pediatrics in 2003. Dr. Poul Thorsen, one of the co-authors and scientist in residence at the CDC 2000-2002, subsequently was terminated by Aarhus University and indicted in Atlanta for embezzlement this year in relation to his $11 million grant from the CDC. Though it must legally respond to within 20 days to FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests, the CDC after almost 7 years of not responding requests concerning vaccines from a doctor with an autistic son was ordered on September 30, 2011 by federal judge to release FOIA documents concerning vaccines. Within less than a month, the Obama administration was criticized by theDenver Post wrote an editorial not realizing the order the CDC had just gotten. Its profoundly disappointing to see the Obama administration proposing changes to FOIA that would allow federal agencies to lie about the very existence of information being sought. Thats not progress, and its certainly not transparency, a principle the president has repeatedly and publicly pledged allegiance to. The worst among [the proposed changes], in our estimation, is the proposed change that would allow the government to tell those requesting information under FOIA that the material does not exist when, in fact, it does. () Moving from a Glomar denial to outright deceit would have even broader ramifications if the person denied information were to decide to take the matter to court. In that case, would the government be in a position of lying to the court about the existence of information? () If agencies are exercising legally allowable exceptions to the law and withholding certain records, they can just continue to do as they do today: neither confirm nor deny the informations existence. This is all the more relevant since FOIAs in the UK, released in March of this year, reveal a 30-year cover-up of the governments knowledge that vaccines dont work, cause the diseases they are claimed to prevent, and that the government had done all possible to block safety studies and colluded in lying to the public about vaccines safety and efficacy.

"In your memoir, â€˜â€˜Love, Loss and What We Ate,â€™â€™ you write that foods are like men: â€˜â€˜Some are good, some are bad and some are O.K. only in small doses. But most should be tried at least once.â€™â€™ Which of the two prompts more regret when youâ€™ve made a bad choice? I donâ€™t have any regrets, thankfully. I donâ€™t even regret trying tripe. But I think human beings do way more damage to each other than anything you can cook in a pot.The book is about food, but what surprised me is that itâ€™s also about feminism. Do you consider yourself a feminist? Absolutely. I would say that I come from a long line of feminists. Maybe my grandmother wouldnâ€™t call herself one â€” just because she didnâ€™t know to â€” but if she started describing her philosophies, they would be in line with the notion that men and women are equal. I donâ€™t think I would date somebody who didnâ€™t consider himself a feminist, frankly.But you had a very lovely relationship with a Republican, Teddy Forstmann. Youâ€™re assuming that a Republican is not a feminist.So you think he was? I think more people are feminists than they let on.You write a lot about your struggles with endometriosis â€” a painful disorder where the uterine lining grows outside the uterus â€” and I found that had an explicitly feminist tone to it, too. Absolutely. I mean, if I had prostate cancer, I would have many more options at my disposal. If I couldnâ€™t get an erection, Iâ€™d have a lot more options at my disposal.You were told by your mother, who was told by her mother: â€˜â€˜This is just something you have to deal with. The pain is just part of being who you are.â€™â€™ Yes, part of being a woman.Do you think that itâ€™s a metaphor for being a woman â€” you have this pain, and you just have to deal with it? I find it interesting â€” interesting being a euphemism â€” that women are often discriminated against for their gynecology. We suffer the consequences of our reproductive place in the world, but we donâ€™t even get enough paid maternity leave.You also write about consuming your daughterâ€™s placenta in dried, powdered form. You characterize that as a difficult decision to make. Was there some cultural taboo that was holding you back? No! I was just grossed out. I mean, look, youâ€™re talking to a girl who grew up as a Brahmin Hindu and was a vegetarian for her formative years, so the idea of eating any meat, let alone your own, took some time for me to get used to. I think making that final leap to eating my own flesh, in whatever form, was a little difficult. I wanted to write about it because I never had the chance to talk about that sort of thing on â€˜â€˜Top Chef.â€™â€™When Bravo first approached you for that show, you said you were skeptical because you tended to watch PBS and the History Channel. Is that still the case? I still watch programming that probably nobody else watches. If Ken Burns filmed his kids, Iâ€™d watch that. I had no idea what â€˜â€˜Top Chefâ€™â€™ would become. I have 13-year-olds who come up to me, telling me that they had an amuse-bouche party at their sleepover.Is it true that the writer Mary Karr introduced you to boxing? Yes. For my 30th birthday, she bought me a boxing lesson. She said, â€˜â€˜This will change your life.â€™â€™ And she was right.Thatâ€™s a strange gift. She boxes! I got hooked because of what it did for me mentally. When someoneâ€™s swinging at you, itâ€™s hard to be daydreaming. Any martial artist will tell you that the person they are most afraid of fighting, out of all the disciplines, is a boxer.Why is that? Because a boxer is trained to sustain pain, to absorb it, to let it happen and let it go. And thatâ€™s a very important skill to have in life. Because you will get hit.",1
"Record numbers of care home residents are being deprived of their liberty by being put in straps, locked in or given behaviour-controlling drugs, fuelling fears that some are being mistreated. Campaigners have voiced concern that some residents, including dementia patients, are being wrongly denied their freedom and treated as â€œsecond-class citizensâ€ â€“ for example, by being locked in their rooms.  In 2015-16, care homes in England asked local councils to approve 195,840 applications to deprive a resident of their liberty â€“ most of them older people â€“ under the deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) legal framework. The figure was the highest since the system began in 2009 and a big jump on the 137,540 applications in the previous year.  Hospitals occasionally seek permission to keep a patient locked up, but care homes make by far the most DoLS applications and have been entering requests much more regularly since a supreme court ruling in March 2014. That judgment, which clarified the form of an â€œacid testâ€ for what constitutes a deprivation of liberty, sparked an immediate and sustained increase in the number of applications.  DoLS requests are usually made to avoid someone harming themselves. Councils have to assess if applications have fulfilled six criteria and respond within 21 days, or within seven days if it is an urgent case. The system is meant to ensure independent assessment of decisions to deny the liberty of people deemed to lack the mental capacity to consent to the care they receive. Of last yearâ€™s 195,840 applications, councils processed 105,055. They approved 76,530 (73%) of those and rejected the rest as inappropriate â€“ a big rise on the 10,520 rejected in the previous year. However, applications are usually considered only after someone has been denied their freedom, which means that last year about 28,500 people were restrained, locked in or given medication before the move was deemed inappropriate.    Related: Care home company fined Â£1.6m for letting woman freeze to death   Martina Kane, senior policy officer at the Alzheimerâ€™s Society, said: â€œThe safeguards granted by deprivation of liberty safeguards are an essential part of protecting the right to liberty of people with dementia. It is disgraceful that nearly 30,000 people were wrongfully deprived of their liberty, and in over a quarter of cases practitioners are still locking people in, sedating them, restraining them or otherwise treating them as second-class citizens.  â€œDepriving someone of their liberty should always be a last resort and only ever done in someoneâ€™s best interests. It is crucial that the quality of care provided to people with dementia is improved to ensure that.â€  Understaffing in care homes could lead to every door in an entire premises being locked overnight, Kane added.  The latest annual DoLS figures collated by NHS Digital show that applications are more likely to be made for older age groups; 44% are for people aged 85 or over. Many of these older people suffer from dementia.  The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the figures were of great concern. â€œThese alarming figures are further evidence of the significant added pressure facing local government as a result of increased DoLS assessments, which is estimated to be costing councils more than Â£170m a year,â€ a spokeswoman said.  â€œThe government needs to fulfil its promise to overhaul the system as a matter of urgency and provide adequate funding so that councils have the time and money to do this properly.â€ ",1
"To many, Gilmore Girls â€“ the cult TV series about a fast-talking, coffee-swilling, pop culture-spieling mother and daughter â€“ is a very precious thing. Fans have been waiting breathlessly for this weekend, when the four 90-minute reunion specials, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, become available on Netflix. Theyâ€™ve been queuing at local cafes pretending to be the diner from the show. There has been endless speculation as to â€œthose final four wordsâ€ â€“ the ending the showâ€™s creator Amy Sherman-Palladino intended for her beloved show but never got the chance to use, having not been at the helm for its final series in 2007. And there have been public service announcements by the cast attempting to deter over-zealous types from revealing spoilers. I too am excited, for I am one of those who holds this show close to their heart. For me, watching the specials feels like coming home.  It is nine years since we last saw Lorelai (Lauren Graham) bid goodbye to her then 23-year-old daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), a budding journalist setting off to join Barack Obamaâ€™s campaign trail. More friends than mother and daughter, facilitated by the 16-year age gap, the girlsâ€™ reunion on the steps of a snow-covered gazebo that opens the first episode is all things Gilmore, albeit with an overt 2016 flavour. Ushered in with the showâ€™s signature â€˜la la laâ€™s and some ear-muffed extras snapping a selfie, the leads barely pause for breath as they talk diphtheria, hummus dip and defending accusations of being Gooped. â€œWow, winded,â€ Rory concedes. â€œHavenâ€™t done that for a while,â€ Lorelai says, and fans everywhere cheer.    A love letter â€¦ fans have been waiting nearly a decade to see this thing done right. Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix   There are new aspects that take some adjustment. Some light swearing and Rory swigging martinis and scotch is a little arresting for those who first met her at 16 years old, but easily overcome when you remember she is now 32 and a thorough-bred WASP. The biggest difference is the feature-length format: naturally, there is more room here. At one point, Rory and Lorelai say nothing to one another for a full five seconds â€“ and these characters rarely do silences. But it soon becomes clear that the show has the chance to exhale every now and then, while still maintaining its hopped-up pace. After a while, the newness starts to feel special.  From the get-go, it is evident that these episodes are a love letter written by Sherman-Palladino and her husband and co-creator, Dan Palladino, to those who have been waiting nearly a decade to see this thing done right. While the script contains enough explanatory dialogue to prop up a new viewer, there are too many in-jokes and oddities for them to really get it. Newbies would surely find fault with some improbable aspects â€“ from Roryâ€™s ludicrously long commute that seems to defy income and time zones, to the inability of either lead to hold a supposedly full coffee cup convincingly.     There is angst and there is pain, but there is also a pet pig â€¦ all three Gilmore women must cope with the loss of Richard. Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix   But joy is found in the abundance of Gilmorisms as we return to Stars Hollow, the town as weird as it is charming: Taylorâ€™s campaigning, Kirkâ€™s hustling, town troubadours squabbling and extras dressed as snowflakes. But there is more meat on these bones than is immediately obvious. The death of the inimitable Edward Herrmann two years ago, who played Richard Gilmore, Lorelaiâ€™s father, has driven the engine of the drama this time around. His characterâ€™s passing looms large â€“ quite literally in the shape of the wall-sized portrait Lorelaiâ€™s mother Emily, played by the tremendous Kelly Bishop, accidentally commissions. All three Gilmore women â€“ for the beauty of this show was that there were three smart, meaty female characters â€“ are forced to confront their lives through the prism of this loss. There is angst and there is pain ... but there is also a pet pig. In short, for fans this is a beautifully wrapped gift. For those who have never seen the show and think it too schmaltzy, that is fine. Do your own thing â€“ or maybe donâ€™t. Itâ€™s cold outside and the world has gone to pot. Do yourself a favour and start watching from the beginning. â€¢ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is on Netflix now. ",1
"According to a disturbing report released Thursday by the Species Survival Network, Chinese poachers have slaughtered more than 280 endangered Yao Mings this year, pushing the majestic creatures to the brink of extinction. The 385-page report revealed that despite international efforts to protect the native Asian species, Yao Mings have recently faced an increased threat from the illegal wildlife trade, as poachers prize the massive yet serene land mammals for their valuable body parts, skin, and glands. 'During June and July alone, Chinese poachers butchered 116 Yao Mings in the mountainous Zhejiang province,' said William Travers, chair of the Species Survival Network board. 'What's even more alarming is that September marks the beginning of the Yao Ming rutting season, and the sweet-tempered primates will be less cautious and at even greater risk of falling prey to hunters.' 'Poachers could potentially massacre thousands of Yao Mings traveling to their ancient breeding grounds searching for mates,' Travers added. 'It's tragic that anyone would hurt a gentle, intelligent, and beautiful Yao Ming that wants nothing more than to peacefully eat leaves from the trees.' A full-grown adult male Yao Ming, which can stand up to 7-feet-6-inches tall and possesses an enormous wingspan of nearly 2-and-a-half meters, can fetch up to $50,000 on the black market. Although the Chinese government banned the trade of Yao Mings in 2002, the SSN report confirmed that demand has risen dramatically, largely because the skin of a Yao Ming is a popular material for jackets, shoes, and purses. 'They're so long and tall that the skin from a single Yao Ming can yield up to 45 designer handbags,' Travers said. 'Sadly, this situation has arisen because Chinese poachers can make more money from killing one Yao Ming than they could by working in a factory for 10 years.' According to the Global Yao Ming Conservation Authority, today there are fewer than 17,000 Yao Mings in China, down from 1.8 million in 2005. Hunters reportedly wiped out much of the population by needlessly taking the lumbering herbivores as trophies, oftentimes mounting their heads as decorations or using their enormous feet for wastebaskets. 'Yao Mings are trusting, social, and playful, so hunters often lure them into a trap by tempting their curiosity with a bouncing basketball,' SSN treasurer Adam Roberts said. 'And when the trap is set, they hack at them with machetes. Sometimes poachers cruelly wrench out all the teeth while the badly injured Yao Ming is still alive. Though the Chinese government has set aside a 250,000-acre wilderness reserve for the species, poaching remains difficult to control, in part because many people believe that Yao Ming genitalia have therapeutic properties. 'It is quite common for Chinese men to use Yao Ming penises in traditional medicine, grinding them up into a fine powder and brewing a penis tea in hopes of increasing their virility,' said Roberts, who has helped rescue and nurse back to health 15 Yao Mings that had their penises removed by poachers. 'It's such a waste of precious life and money. People quickly learn that you can't improve your sex life by sipping on a hot beverage made from dried Yao Ming penis.' The SSN issued a statement this week urging consumers to boycott illegal products made from Yao Mings. 'The best way to help us stop the merciless killing of these tender creatures is by refusing to eat Yao Mings or wear apparel made from Yao Mings,' the statement read in part. 'And certainly do not try to keep a Yao Ming as a pet.' ",0
"Garrison Keillorâ€™s â€œA Prairie Home Companionâ€ signed off the air for good on Saturday evening, after 42 seasons, as millions of listeners, many in their cars on a holiday weekend, tuned in via public radio.With the exception of a telephone call from President Obama, the show, which was recorded Friday at the Hollywood Bowl in front of 18,000 people, ambled along the way it always has. There were pretty country-folk songs; an ad for Powdermilk Biscuits; a clippety-clop â€œLives of the Cowboysâ€ skit; a heartfelt version of â€œEvery Time We Say Goodbye.â€The phone call was telling. The self-effacing Mr. Keillor refused to allow the conversation to be about himself. He praised Mr. Obamaâ€™s â€œdignity and wit and humorâ€ and the fact heâ€™d â€œnever had an awkward moment in all these years.â€ When the president was finally allowed to speak about Mr. Keillor, he said, â€œOne of the reasons I miss driving is that you kept me company.â€ â€œA Prairie Home Companion,â€ he said, â€œmade me feel better and more human.â€ Mr. Keillor responded with awkward silence.The segment of the show that promised a bit of stronger emotional drama was Mr. Keillorâ€™s final monologue, his concluding â€œNews from Lake Wobegon.â€ And it delivered, in its way, by not trying too hard to deliver. It was, to borrow words the former New York Times critic Anatole Broyard once used to describe a middling Philip Roth novel, â€œreasonably funny, reasonably sad, reasonably interesting.â€If that sounds dismissive, itâ€™s not meant to be. Mr. Keillor has always worn his storytelling gifts casually. Here, he seemed to take a page from â€œPontoonâ€ (2007), one of his Lake Wobegon novels, in which he wrote, â€œYou get old and you realize there are no answers, just stories.â€Mr. Keillor liked to say that his fictional townâ€™s name, Wobegon, comes from an also fictional Indian word that means â€œthe place where we waited all day in the rain [for you].â€ His final monologue was 17 minutes long and opened with a hymn to rain. About sunny days, he asked, â€œHow many do we deserve?â€ As a boy, he said, sunny days meant ruined days. Heâ€™d have to go dig potatoes or play softball, for which he had no talent. How much more blissful to be indoors with an adventure novel.Mr. Keillor described a sun-filled day, even as the talk moved into the shadows. This monologue was a ghost tour, a rumination on impermanence. The narrator walked through his hometown and commented: â€œWhen youâ€™ve lived in one place for so long, you go back and you are in a museum. Everywhere you go, there are the dead.â€Mr. Keillorâ€™s fictional universe, in his radio shows and books, has often been compared to Sherwood Andersonâ€™s â€œWinesburg, Ohio.â€ The comparisons are apt. Like Anderson, Mr. Keillor has a feel for loneliness and isolation.In the final â€œNews From Lake Wobegon,â€ Mr. Keillorâ€™s narrator walks by the townâ€™s Chatterbox Cafe (â€œthe place to go thatâ€™s just like homeâ€) and recalls where various locals, now dead, used to sit. One of these is Jack, from Jackâ€™s Auto Repair, who made appearances in these monologues.In this monologue, Jack stood in for the listeners who dislike Mr. Keillorâ€™s show, whoâ€™ve found it to be more Mayberry than Winesburg, an overly sugared Midwestern hot dish. (I sometimes felt this way, and have dialed the show out for years at time. On many other Saturday evenings over the decades, Iâ€™ve been overjoyed to find it during a long drive. The show could indeed be good company.)â€œJack never cared for my radio show and he told me every time he saw me,â€ Mr. Keillor said. â€œHe was a jazz guy. He did not care for sentimental songs about home. Though I did point out to him that half the sentimental songs about home are about wanting to leave home.â€Mr. Keillor reported talking to Larry, the owner of the townâ€™s graveyard, who tells him heâ€™ll be buried next to Jack. Thereâ€™s no escaping oneâ€™s critics.As the monologue began to come to its close, Mr. Keillor, 73, spoke about how he might be remembered, if at all.â€œI am at that age now where people start to use the word â€˜legacy,â€™ although there is no such thing and we all know that,â€ he said. â€œRadio has the permanence of a sand castle. Even books that are printed on acid-free paper, they tend to migrate toward recycling rather quickly.â€Itâ€™s an interesting question, Mr. Keillorâ€™s legacy. He left a lot of uncomplicated pleasure in his wake, and some complicated pleasure, too. For his showâ€™s fans there are always reruns and downloads. For those of us whoâ€™ve gravitated more to his prose, which can be savvy and tough-minded, the best news is that heâ€™s said to be working on a memoir. Itâ€™s a book that, if he bears down, Iâ€™d wait in the rain for.",1
" Iâ€™m looking to purchase a tower PC for working from home, ideally for less than Â£500. It must have a processor fast enough to manage my work across multiple Excel spreadsheets, as well as running Microsoft Word and Google Chrome at the same time. At the moment, I am using an old laptop with two external monitors. When I try to process my spreadsheets, things slow down to the point of freezing, or it crashes. Diana  You are right in thinking that a tower PC will generally run faster than a similarly priced laptop. Towers provide plenty of space for chips to run hotter and therefore faster than they can in laptops, without throttling performance to avoid overheating problems. An Intel Core i5-6 should be more than adequate for your needs. A Core i7 would be better, but usually pushes the price up considerably. You can compare processor speeds and operating temperatures at NotebookCheck. Heavyweight tasks such as recalculating large spreadsheets also tend to require more memory. Itâ€™s usually easier to add RAM to a tower than a laptop. You can also add faster graphics cards and multiple hard drives, including Blu-ray drives for backups. At the moment, your Excel work is probably limited by a shortage of RAM. (A PC is more likely to crash if it runs out of memory than if it runs out of processing power.) If your laptop has 4GB of memory, you should start with at least 8GB and make sure you can upgrade to 16GB or more. You can check the upgrade options in the manufacturerâ€™s service or repair manual or, if you know the model number, Crucialâ€™s website. PC motherboards usually have either two or four memory slots, so ideally at least one should be free for an upgrade. For example, 8GB should be on one stick, not on two 4GB sticks. If you have 8GB and one free slot, you can upgrade to 16GB by buying one 8GB stick for less than Â£50. It would cost twice as much to replace two unwanted 4GB sticks with two new 8GB sticks. Ready built or DIY? There are still plenty of desktop towers available off-the-shelf from retailers such as John Lewis, Currys PC World and Argos. You can also buy them directly from small British companies, such as (in alphabetical order) Chillblast, PC Specialist and Scan, as well as from giant business suppliers such as Dell, HP and Lenovo. Zoostorm, another British company, sells through a range of outlets including Amazon, Argos and Tesco. Part of the appeal of direct suppliers is that you can often customise PCs to get what you want. Unfortunately, the number of configuration options has fallen dramatically over the past five years, especially on the cheaper ranges. It can also be a bit of a nightmare trying to find out which parts you can upgrade yourself. If Crucial doesnâ€™t know, you can always ask in the support forums for each PC. The ultimate form of customisation is to build your own PC from scratch. This takes more effort, but the PC Part Picker website provides plenty of sample builds. You can share your selection of parts to see if other users can suggest improvements. One drawback is that Windows costs a lot more if itâ€™s bought separately, rather than pre-installed on a PC, partly because it includes Microsoft support. Home or business PC? If you are buying a PC for business use, consider a business PC. These should not include the sort of third-party â€œcrapwareâ€ that most suppliers bundle with consumer PCs to reduce the cost of pre-installing Windows, sometimes to zero or less. However, most suppliers still bundle anti-virus software and some of their own â€œutilitiesâ€, which are not always useful. Business PCs usually run 64-bit Windows 10 Pro rather than the Home version. It probably doesnâ€™t matter for your purposes. The main advantages of the Pro version are the ability to attach to corporate networks, BitLocker drive encryption, built-in virtualisation, Group Policy controls and Windows Update for Business. Pro also supports 2TB of memory, compared with Homeâ€™s 128GB. The main attraction is business support. Itâ€™s painful to lug a desktop PC to your local store and RTB (return to base) repairs can take up to two weeks. By contrast, you can buy business PCs with business support. Dell offers from three to five years of pro support and â€œnext business dayâ€ on-site service for Â£70 to Â£200, depending on what the original PC starts with. HP offers four years of â€œnext coverage day call to repairâ€ on desktops for up to Â£208.80. Itâ€™s only Â£1 a week. Possible purchases The Lenovo IdeaCentre 510S is one of your cheapest off-the-shelf options with a Core i5-6400, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for Â£399.99 at PC World. (â€œWas Â£629.99â€, it says.) Itâ€™s also selling the same machine with a fast Core i7-6700 for Â£599.99. Zoostormâ€™s Origin desktop PC is another affordable option, with the Intel Core i5-6400/8GB version available on Amazon.co.uk for Â£419.99. HPâ€™s Pavilion range of desktops with Core i5-6400 processors at PC World start with the Pavilion 550-202na for Â£599.99. This has the usual 8GB of memory (maximum 16GB), an AMD Radeon R5-330 graphics card with 2GB, a 128GB SSD, a 3TB hard drive and a DVD writer. Buying direct from HP, you could get a Pavilion 550-252na tower in red, white or blue for Â£429. This model has a Core i5-6400 processor with 8GB of memory (2 x 4GB, sadly), a 1TB hard drive and a DVD burner, leaving one internal hard drive bay free. There is no professional service for this, but you could add three years of pickup and return service for Â£29. Alternatively, you could get much the same thing with a 2TB hard drive â€“ the Pavilion 550-254na â€“ from John Lewis for Â£479.95. In this case, the price includes a two-year guarantee. Buying direct from Dell, you could get an Inspiron 3650 with a Core i5-6400, 8GB of memory (one slot free), Nvidia GeForce 730 graphics card with 2GB of memory, 128GB SSD, 1TB hard drive, DVD writer and Windows 10 Home for Â£519 (Code CD65032). Sadly, you only get one year of collect and return support with no better options. Switching to the very similar Vostro 3650 would provide a Core i5-6400 with only 4GB, no graphics card and no second hard drive for Â£394.80, plus Â£30 delivery. The only advantage is that you could add four years of on-site service for Â£140. You could always stick 8GB of memory into the empty slot to bring the RAM up to 12GB. The most configurable affordable tower PC I can find is the Lenovo ThinkCenter M800. It offers a choice of six processors, nine memory configurations from 4GB to 32GB and nine first or second hard drives. Prices start at Â£379.99, but you can select an Intel Core i5-6400, 8GB of memory (leaving three slots free), and a 128GB SSD for Â£485.99: just under budget. To that, I would add a 1TB secondary hard drive for Â£58.80 and another 8GB of RAM for Â£52.80, bringing the grand total to Â£597.59. Of course, you could do these upgrades yourself later if you find you need them. Thereâ€™s not much to choose between these PCs. The Lenovo IdeaCentre 510S is cheapest, while the ThinkCenter M800 is the most configurable and possibly the best. Otherwise, the Dell Inspiron 3650 is good value at Â£519. If you shop around, you may well find some HP Pavilion 550 desktops with better specifications at better prices. Argos sometimes has deals, while Laptops Direct has deals and refurbished models.

"After settling for bronze in the Team Artistic Gymnastic event Tuesday, the U.S. men's team promised reporters that, for the remainder of the Olympics, they would weep wholeheartedly before events, mist up despite themselves while performing flairs, and sob uncontrollably in either victory or frustration following every routine.

"Voters in Equatorial Guinea converge in voting centers on Sunday to elect their president among the five candidates, including the current head of state, Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has declared that he does not expect anything less than 97 percent of the votes cast. Polling stations are scheduled to open at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). The candidate for the ruling Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE), Obiang, who has been in power for three decades, won the last election in December 2002 with 97.1 percent of the votes cast. The four other candidates are Placido Minko Abogo of the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), Carmelo Mba Bacale of the Popular Action for Equatorial Guinea, Achivaldo Montero of the People's Union and Bonaventura Monsuy Asumu of the Coalition of Social democrats Party. The elections are seen as a race mainly between Obiang and Minko Abogo, although the president is widely expected to win another landslide victory. Obiang led a coup in August 1979 which toppled the then leader Francisco Macias Nguema. In 1982, He was elected president for a seven-year term. Obiang was re-elected in 1989, 1996 and 2002, each time with more than 90 percent of vote. Mico Abogo is the only CPDS deputy in the Chamber of People's Representatives (parliament). His party won one out of the 100 seats in the parliamentary elections in 2008, while the PDGE and its allies took all the rest. This Central African country covers 28,051 square km with a population of one million. it is made up of two parts: the mainland part which borders Cameroon and Gabon, and islands where the capital Malabo is located.

"Stephen Daldryâ€™s 2000 film Billy Elliot was a Bafta-winning critical and commercial hit. His 2005 stage musical version of the story about a working-class boy who wants to be a ballet dancer has been seen by 11 million people. His production of An Inspector Calls, JB Priestleyâ€™s thriller of social conscience, has scooped armfuls of awards and is the National Theatreâ€™s longest-running show. Wondrously, both stage shows are still going strong today, with the touring production of Priestleyâ€™s 70-year-old drama about a mystery visitor who unravels a familyâ€™s secrets returning to the West End next month. It is now the longest-running revival in theatrical history. Yet any suggestion that Daldry has become a phenomenon akin to Andrew Lloyd Webber, an impresario who maintains a fleet of enduring stage hits in a variety of venues, is not welcome. Daldry wants to be more troublesome, less mainstream, than that. Next month he will have another go at rocking the cultural boat. Not content with an esteemed career in the world of film, making The Hours and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, or a recent theatrical triumph on both sides of the Atlantic with The Audience, the play with Helen Mirren as the Queen, the 56-year-old has now created the most expensive television drama of all time â€“ and possibly the most ambitious. The Crown, telling the story of Elizabeth II from 1947 to the present day, will launch on 4 November on Netflix and has already been hailed by critics as the television drama series that will blast through established viewing habits, drawing older audiences away from traditional channels. Awarded five stars by reviewers on the Times and the Telegraph, it is a forensic examination of the politics and personal dramas negotiated by the royal family and, at a rumoured cost of Â£100m, marks the American subscription serviceâ€™s big push into new audiences. â€œThey are expanding, both in the number of people who are subscribing, and into territories like Australia and India. I assume that is why they responded to our request,â€ said Daldry. One of the â€œgreat joysâ€, he adds, of working for Netflix is the creative freedom. â€œThere were no anxieties in the area of editorial control, not that we set out to do a hatchet job on the royal family by any stretch of the imagination.â€ The atmosphere at the productionâ€™s Elstree base has been close to a backstage theatrical experience, he says, puffing cigarette smoke enthusiastically over the roof of the Young Vic theatre in London, where he is advising on Isango Ensembleâ€™s new show, A Man of Good Hope. â€œNetflix have been a fantastic company to work for. I have never been in a more convivial and happy production team. There are no commercial breaks for viewers and they donâ€™t tell us how long to make the thing either.â€    Stephen Daldry. Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer   Whether The Crown is the show that changes the game or not, Daldry believes subscription television is the likely future of entertainment: â€œWho wants to got to the cinema on a Friday night now? You might get certain break-out movies, but online streaming of drama has altered the whole thing. You can subscribe and see 40 TV shows, or go out to the cinema for a night for the same money.â€ Daldry might seem like a creative nomad, moving on from one medium and from one theme to another, but it is possible to spot the social concerns that crop up in his work. Both Priestleyâ€™s morality puzzle and The Crown are rooted in postwar Britain. Although the play is set before the first world war, it was first performed in London at the New Theatre, now the NoÃ«l Coward, at the moment the young Princess Elizabeth was preparing for marriage. It is an era the director says he finds hard to view as a â€œperiodâ€ setting. Instead, he says that both the venerable stage play and his new television series, written by Peter Morgan, strive to represent the real world we live in, rather than a past where â€œthey do things differentlyâ€. â€œNeither of them are really like costume dramas,â€ Daldry says. â€œWith The Crown we are attentive to detail, but it is not one of those dramas where you look at the dresses. I hope it doesnâ€™t feel like one of those.â€ As with An Inspector Calls, the issues in The Crown feel contemporary, to say nothing of the bad language (the King swears at full throttle in the first five minutes) or of the focus on gritty subjects such as Anthony Edenâ€™s drug addiction. Daldry says he does not watch costume drama. â€œI donâ€™t know why. I am not knocking it. I havenâ€™t seen ITVâ€™s Victoria yet. I did try to watch Downton on an aeroplane, but it is not really my thing.â€ What he does find interesting, he says, is the anthropology of class, of royalty and of the church. â€œPriestley wrote An Inspector Calls as part of that huge shift in postwar consensus, the wakening of a social conscience. He wrote it as political agitation, so people would not go back to Edwardian values, and when we first did it Margaret Thatcher was talking about returning to prewar values. Whenever you watch the play it seems to be politically relevant. It feels urgent in different ways. I first intended the chorus who come on carrying bundles to be the people of 1945, but when we did it in Dartford at the beginning of the year they suddenly looked like dispossessed refugees.â€ It is odd revisiting a show he directed 24 years ago, Daldry says. â€œI am now in my late 50s and am wondering whether I would do the audacious risk-taking now.â€ He wonders if he might have been harder on the royals then: â€œI have more respect because I know so much more now. Who knew Prince Philip (played by Matt Smith ) was a radical reformer who really did want to modernise them?â€ Morgan and Daldryâ€™s original idea, born of their work on The Audience, was to â€œcontinue the study of a family that werenâ€™t born to be the royal family of England and look at all the tensions and trials they go throughâ€. Daldry found it extraordinary just how much of their lives were discussed in cabinet sessions. â€œOur rule was that the TV show would be about everything that became a constitutional crisis, not just the aborted engagement of Princess Margaret, but it broadened out a bit. We have fantastic researchers on the show, but we have deliberately had no contact with the palace. We always know when we are departing from the absolute truth, and of course no one knows the dialogue, so what you get of course is an imaginative interpretation. Peter describes it as The Sopranos meets The West Wing.â€   I haven't seen ITV's Victoria yet. I did try to watch Downton, but it is not really my thing  Stephen Daldry    Daldry, as may now be evident, is busy. With 10 episodes of the first season of The Crown made, he is working on season two in Hungary, where Budapest will stand in for Germany and viewers will meet Prince Philipâ€™s family (many married to Nazis). Aside from the Young Vic show, and the work with the three new cast members joining An Inspector Calls for the West End run, he is in New York frequently. Not only do his children go to school there, he is working on two high-profile arts building projects, Pier 55 and the new performance centre on the site of Ground Zero. He has also just returned from a UN assembly â€œglobal exchangeâ€ session, which he attended with fellow members of the board of the Good Chance theatre company, working with people in the Calais refugee camp. Rather than being overstretched, Daldry is, he claims, â€œthrilled by all the connectionsâ€ he sees in his varied projects. While the play at the Young Vic deals with the violent reaction to the Somali refugee crisis in South Africa, the director is also working in a climate heavily weighted with reaction to refugees who have flown in the other direction, north to Europe. â€œAt the moment Billy Elliot is getting an incredible response in Edinburgh when the show talks about the collapse of community or the attack on union rights. People yell out. I love it when An Inspector Calls feels radical too. Sometimes people applaud in unexpected places.â€ Finding quite such a radical resonance in his next film project, Wicked: The Movie, may be a bigger ask, but Daldry may well try. THE TOP FIVE An Inspector Calls 1992Daldryâ€™s production of Priestleyâ€™s play for the National Theatre is still going.

"Ever since his divorce from his wife of 22 years became final in June, Rep. Chuck Brunet (R-NC) sees 'Mary's face in every piece of legislation' that comes across his desk, the Oklahoma lawmaker told reporters Tuesday. 'I couldn't even bring myself to vote on the farm-subsidy bill last week,' said Brunet, who has reportedly missed more than half a dozen House votes on similar bills because they 'remind [him] of the times we went apple picking.' 'And every time that net neutrality motion comes up in subcommittee, I think of all those e-mails she used to send me. Oh God, Mary!' Capitol Hill sources say Brunet led a filibuster against increased funding for the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month because his ex-wife met her current boyfriend on a flight to Atlanta.

"A note from the desk of a newborn adult  Tomorrow I turn 20, and itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been able to think about for days. I walk around the city, up by the park and by the health food store and down into the subway, this new age hanging in front of my eyes like two of those Mylar balloons that never come down. Can people see it, I wonder, that Iâ€™m about to cross over? On the subway I stare at boys I want to kiss, and girls I want to hug. Do you see me? Iâ€™m eating raspberries sitting up in bed, thinking about watching The Crown, and I probably should have written something nicer ages ago but my head is so full of lyrics and drums these days that this is all I can manage. But it feels very important I write to you, for some reason.   Related: Lorde: 'The critics I care about are people the same age as me'   I was 16 when most of us met. Can you believe it? I laugh thinking about that me now â€“ that glossy idiot god, princess of her childhood streets, handmade and ugly and sure of herself. All my life Iâ€™ve been obsessed with adolescence, drunk on it. Even when I was little, I knew that teenagers sparkled. I knew they knew something children didnâ€™t know, and adults ended up forgetting. Since 13 Iâ€™ve spent my life building this giant teenage museum, mausoleum maybe, dutifully, wolfishly writing every moment down, and repeating it all back like folklore. And now there isnâ€™t any more of it. (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) (*insert that emoji that looks like itâ€™s eating its own face with worry, and also the one with sunglasses, and maybe also the poo*)    â€˜Sometime in the last year or so, part of me crossed over.â€™ Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Getty Images   And I know, I know! Thereâ€™s different stuff. Stuff thatâ€™s just as good, maybe better, just in a different way. If Iâ€™m being real with myself, in some ways I stopped feeling like a teenager a while ago. Sometime in the last year or so, part of me crossed over. For one thing, I made a very deliberate choice to withdraw for a little while from a public life. I havenâ€™t had my hair or makeup done in a year, the free handbags dried up LONG ago, and the paparazzi at the airport are almost always for someone else. And let me tell you, as much as I love being full noise album cycle girl, itâ€™s been a motherfucking joy. (Every once in a while I am recognised on the street â€“ one of you breathlessly clutches my hand, shaking and speaking quickly, and I feel this SHOCK of love.)   I just need to keep working a while longer to make it as good as it can be. Youâ€™ll have to hold on   I turned inwards to my friends, my family, towards this moment, so I could learn more about who I was, and so I could let this new project show itself to me. And oh my god, it was a colossal year! One for the ages. I maxed out every single emotion I have in the best possible way, the colours still aching behind my eyes like this weird blissful hangover. My heart broke. I moved out of home and into the city and I made new friends and started to realize that no one is just good or bad, that everyone is both. I started to discover in a profound, scary, blood-aching way who I was when I was alone, what I did when I did things only for myself. I was reckless and graceless and terrifying and tender. I threw sprawling parties and sat in restaurants until the early hours, learning what itâ€™s like to be an adult, even talking like one sometimes, until I caught myself. All I wanted to do was dance. I whispered into ears and let my eyes blaze on high and for the first time I felt this intimate, empire-sized inner power. And then I wrote a record about it, all of it, so much more than what Iâ€™ve written down here, and Iâ€™m in New York getting it done. And tomorrow, Iâ€™m not a kid any more, and more and more Iâ€™m realizing that the weirdness of those Mylar balloons is going to be okay.   Related: Lorde: Pure Heroine â€“ review   Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record â€“ well, this one is about what comes next.  I want nothing more than to spill my guts RIGHT NOW about the whole thing â€“ I want you to see the album cover, pore over the lyrics (the best Iâ€™ve written in my life), touch the merch, experience the live show. I can hardly stop myself from typing out the name. I just need to keep working a while longer to make it as good as it can be. Youâ€™ll have to hold on. The big day is not tomorrow, or even next month realistically, but soon. I know you understand. Oh my god, itâ€™s midnight now! Iâ€™m 20, fuck! And my perfect little brother Angelo is 15! Happy birthday kid. Sorry your sister is so weird and emotional in public all the time. What Iâ€™m trying to say is: this is a special birthday. The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world. ",1
"Citing an inability to adequately care for the aging all-powerful deity, members of the human race told reporters Monday that they were forced to put down God, the omniscient creator worshipped by billions of followers of various faiths for more than 6,000 years. This is something weve been putting off for a long time, but at the end of the day, its whats best for Him, said human Daniel Whiting of Appleton, WI, acknowledging that the difficult decision comes after years of dealing with The Divine Creators sapped energy, urinary tract infections, recurring blindness in His left eye, and noticeable lack of strength and enthusiasm. At some point, you just have to think about what will make God suffer less: letting Him live in pain for a thousand more years or just letting Him go peacefully in His sleep now? Sure, it was a difficult decision, but it was inevitable, concurred Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Vatican City. After all, He was already 13 billion years old. According to sources, at approximately 1:34 p.m. Monday afternoon the elderly Almighty Father was injected with a high dosage of pentobarbital, allowing Him to slowly drift to sleep before experiencing painless cardiac arrest followed immediately by death. In the hours since the passing of The Maker of Heaven and Earth, the human race told reporters that, while they certainly missed having Him around, they preferred to enjoy their fond memories of a younger and more energetic God. The excitability and joy for life He used to radiate was infectious, said Maria Castellanos of Guadalajara, Mexico, referring to the days when the Divine Being would friskily follow the human race wherever they went and get Himself into all kinds of trouble. But for the last millennia or so, He spent most of His time just moping aroundrarely ever using His omnipotence and barely even capable of rendering miracles and answering prayers. He hardly even acknowledged [humanity] as we went about our day, really. He was just sort of there, Castellanos added. And as much as we enjoyed having Him around, He just didnt have it in Him to do the things He used to love to do. The worlds 7.14 billion people went on to admit that there were numerous instances when they considered putting God to sleep but ultimately relented. There was a time around the third century B.C. when God was just so aggressive and uncontrollable we thought wed definitely have to put Him down, Harvard theologian Peter Gomes said this week. And there were some other close calls, like the time He was hit by a car in 1983. But He always bounced back. This time, though, we finally had to acknowledge that it was time to say goodbye. Despite reporting a distinct feeling of sadness and loss, the human race confirmed today that they were also reminiscing on many memories of the Supreme Lord and Saviors life, from His very first creation of the heavens and earth, to the time He rambunctiously flooded the earth for 150 days, to His allowance of the Holocaust from 1938 to 1945, to the sweet sunset he conjured on the evening of July 12, 1998. The thing that makes me feel better is knowing that He had a great life, even when things got a little rough at the very end, Beijing-area human Huai Cheng said. Itll be hard letting go, but when its the right time, well talk about getting another God. Maybe even two of them, Huai added. ",0
"U.N. finalizing Arms Trade Treaty, U.S. claims Second Amendment will be protectedBy Madison Ruppert As Brent Daggett rightly wrote in his fantastic summary of the ATT, the treaty was originally proposed all the way back in 2003. However, it was not actually addressed in the UN until December of 2006 when the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled, Towards an Arms Trade Treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. Since that time, support for the treaty along with what I believe are misguidedly optimistic interpretations of its implications has grown considerably. This is evidenced by rehashed claims such as that of Timothy Johnson, who writes for Media Matters for America (an incredibly biased and imbalanced George Soros-backed operation), U.S. gun owners have nothing to fear from a treaty that essentially seeks to apply the standard for importing and exporting firearms already in place in the United States on a worldwide scale. Unsurprisingly, Johnsons only sources are: the chair of the Preparatory Committee for the UN Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, Ambassador Roberto Garca Moritn of Argentina, a UN General Assembly resolution, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a senior policy advisor to Oxfam America. One of Johnsons main sources in claiming that concern over this treaty is nothing but a laughable conspiracy [which] has no place in reality is the UN General Assembly resolution passed on January 12, 2010. This resolution (which isnt actually cited by Johnson but instead the reader is provided with a broken link), coded as A/RES/64/48, states: Acknowledging also the right of States to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownership, exclusively within their territory. If you want to read the resolution yourself, which I recommend you do, click this link and then navigate to item number 29, The arms trade treaty : resolution / adopted by the General Assembly. It appears relatively clear that Johnson is taking this out of the context of the resolution, which contains the presupposition that arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security, which I do not think is necessarily a reasonable conclusion. Sure, disarmament and non-proliferation are, in and of themselves, wonderful ideas. However, when some states are disarmed while others are not or when private citizens are disarmed and governments are not, international peace and security is not the most likely outcome. Interestingly the resolution Johnson cited acknowledges only the right of all States to manufacture, import, export, transfer and retain conventional arms for self-defence and security needs and in order to participate in peace support operations, while still acknowledging the right of States to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownership, exclusively within their territory. Unfortunately, this resolution clearly isnt actually protecting the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, instead it is just acknowledging that sovereign nations have the right to follow their own laws. This does not, however, mean that anyone is actually protected by this resolution, it simply acknowledges that if states have national constitutional protections on private ownership, they are allowed to follow them. Personally, I see this as absurd as it is simply restating the obvious: the UN has absolutely no place meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. If they did, the UN would thereby undermine everything that sovereignty really is. Johnson also attempts to claim that the UN shouldnt actually be supporting the rights of people around the world to protect themselves with firearms if need be. Unsurprisingly, he is unable to cite anything but research from the United Nations. Unfortunately, the United States already professed support for the treaty all the way back in 2009, with some Key U.S. Redlines which they claim cannot be crossed by the treaty. These redlines are, according to the U.S. State Department: That all sounds quite wonderful, doesnt it? The only problem is that the promise is being made by none other than the Obama administration, which is just about the least trustworthy source it could possibly come from. After all, I bet a lot of people thought Obama was serious about stopping the warrantless wiretapping, when it turns out he is fighting to keep it by utilizing the tired state secret claim despite the testimony of former NSA employees. I bet a lot of people thought he was serious about stopping the medical marijuana raids, the countless wars (which show no signs of stopping), the overwhelming lobbyist influence in Washington and submitting his administration to a previously unknown level of transparency. Of course, all of this is patently untrue as you can see from the above links. If you believe that the Obama administration will suddenly become trustworthy, I believe that it is quite unlikely that any amount of factual evidence will get you to think otherwise. Yet, even if we accept the Obama administrations alleged redlines as truthful (which is a stretch), it must be noted that several American allies disagree with some of these positions. The governments of the UK, France, Germany and Sweden all released a joint position this week which states, We believe that an arms trade treaty should cover all types of conventional weapons, notably including small arms and light weapons, all types of munitions, and related technologies. Furthermore, CNS News notes: On the issue of consensus, the Control Arms coalition also wants the conference to follow usual U.N. practice, requiring wide agreement on a final text but not giving countries veto power. This means that the United States could easily have each and everyone one of those redlines crossed while still claiming something to the effect of, Well, at least we did the best we could! They also point out that a quite venerable coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including Oxfam (cited above by Johnson) and Amnesty International (AI), has stated that not only must the treaty be enforceable but include international reporting of sales and a mechanism with which to monitor compliance with the treaty. Is it just me or does that sound a lot like it would violate this redline, There will be no mandate for an international body to enforce an ATT, doesnt it? Our common goal is clear: a robust and legally-binding arms trade treaty that will have a real impact on the lives of those millions of people suffering from the consequences of armed conflict, repression and armed violence, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Of course, he does not believe that people suffering from the consequences of armed conflict, repression and armed violence, actually have the right to defend themselves, instead handing the sole power over to the UN. No surprise there. I just caution my readers to realize and tell others that trusting the Obama administration to stick to these redlines even if the Obama administration had veto power, which it doesnt is horribly misguided and nave.

"A plainclothes New York City police detective was shot on Tuesday, apparently in a crossfire with a sergeant, as they sought to make a drug arrest in Brooklyn and the suspects tried to flee in a car, the police said.The detective was struck in the left shoulder and was in stable condition.The suspects, whom the authorities said were dealing heroin, were in a car parked near Wilson Avenue and Troutman Street in the Bushwick neighborhood shortly after 6 p.m., when the detective and a sergeant approached them during an antidrug operation, officials said.The car swung into reverse, hitting the police car, and the detective, who was on the passenger side, reached inside the vehicle, the authorities said. The car accelerated, with the detective partially inside, and both officers opened fire.The police said the detective, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he was â€œconscious, alert and talking.â€â€œHe is in good spirits,â€ Benjamin B. Tucker, first deputy commissioner of the Police Department, said during a news conference at the hospital. â€œFor someone whoâ€™s been shot, he was awake, he was alert.â€One person taken into custody, a 45-year-old man who was behind the wheel, was hit in the wrist and the leg by gunfire, the police said; he was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, but his condition was not immediately available. Another man, 51, was also taken into custody. A search for a third person at the scene of the transaction, which included $80 worth of heroin, continued late on Tuesday. The police said the brand of heroin was called American Dream.Both of the men in custody, whose names were not released, have extensive criminal histories, the police said. The 45-year-old man had 58 prior arrests, many of which were related to drug trafficking, the authorities said.No gun was found at the scene.â€œToday, a detective put his life on the line as he bravely performed his duty to protect our city and its residents from harm,â€ Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. â€œWeâ€™re grateful the detective is doing well, and we wish him a safe and swift recovery.â€In Bushwick, in an area where streets are lined with apartment buildings, bodegas and bars, many residents were startled by the sounds of gunfire and crashing cars ringing out during the evening rush.Fadl Alhaj, a worker at a deli and grocery on the corner of Troutman and Wilson, said he heard three gunshots around 6:10 p.m. He quickly closed his door, he said, and did not see what was happening outside.â€œWe didnâ€™t know what was going on,â€ Mr. Alhaj said. â€œWe thought it was a street fight.â€Bri Brown was setting up the bar at Miles, a cocktail lounge on Wilson Avenue, when she saw people sprinting down the block and poked her head outside. Halfway down the block, she said, she saw a middle-aged plainclothes officer in the street.â€œHe was on the ground, he was screaming, â€˜Iâ€™ve been shot!â€™â€ she said. â€œHe was ducked between two cars, laying on his stomach.â€Ms. Brown said she ran inside and called 911, and not long after, she saw a man in handcuffs being taken away by two officers. She did not know if he was the gunman.â€œItâ€™s still Bushwick; shootings happen sometimes still,â€ she said of the area, which was busy around the time of the shooting with people coming home from work. â€œBut I would say itâ€™s pretty rare, especially since it was an officer.â€The episode was one of several instances so far this year in which officers have been shot and wounded in the city; none of the shootings have been fatal.In January, an officer was shot in the ankle as the police responded to a raucous party in the South Bronx. In February, two officers were shot in the stairwell of a housing complex in that neighborhood. Another pair of officers were shot in Brooklyn last month.Police officials noted the dangers of stopping suspects in vehicles, as happened on Tuesday. They said heroin had been a persisting problem, in New York and across the country.â€œWe go out there every day and talk to the residents,â€ Assistant Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, the Police Departmentâ€™s commander for Brooklyn North, said of narcotics work. â€œWe try to find out whatâ€™s going on in the community. We make proactive arrests. And we try to work with the community to clean it up.â€",1

"US President Barack Obama's winning of the Nobel Peace prize should encourage him to commit to an international treaty on global warming, the UN climate chief said Friday. As two weeks of UN climate talks concluded in Bangkok, there were fears of time running out for 192 countries to reach an agreement ahead of a December showdown in Copenhagen, the deadline for a deal to tackle global warming. The UN's top climate official, Yvo De Boer, said he hoped Obama's win would be 'an encouragement for him to bring a strong commitment to Copenhagen'. The looming question of how Washington will fit into any new agreement has dominated the talks in the Thai capital and there are now just six days of negotiations, in November, before the critical Denmark gathering. Hopes for a leading US role in the world's climate change efforts have been dampened by indications that its Congress will not pass major legislation on the issue by the end of the year. ",1

"In the years before Hillary Clinton announced she would run again for president, her top aides expressed profound concerns in internal emails about how foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clintonâ€™s own moneymaking ventures would affect Mrs. Clintonâ€™s political future.The emails, obtained by hackers and being gradually released by WikiLeaks this month, also are revealing how efforts to minimize potential conflicts at the foundation led to power struggles and infighting among aides and Mrs. Clintonâ€™s family.One top aide to Mr. Clinton, Douglas J. Band, noted in an email that the former president had received personal income from some foundation donors and â€œgets many expensive gifts from them.â€Chelsea Clinton accused her fatherâ€™s aides of taking â€œsignificant sums of money from my parents personally,â€ of â€œhustlingâ€ during foundation events to win clients for their own business, and of even installing spyware on her chief of staffâ€™s computer.Hillary Clinton, another email showed, had promised to attend a Clinton Foundation gathering in Morocco at the behest of its king, who had pledged $12 million to the charity. Her advisers worried that would look unseemly just as she was beginning her presidential campaign in earnest.â€œShe created this mess and she knows it,â€ a close aide, Huma Abedin, wrote of Mrs. Clinton in a January 2015 email.For months, the Clintons have defended their foundation, making public proclamations that it went above and beyond what the law required in terms of transparency while Mrs. Clinton was at the State Department.The emails, which came from the account of John D. Podesta, who had a leadership role at the foundation and is now Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, have not contained evidence to support Republican contentions that Mrs. Clinton performed any favors for foundation donors.But they do show pronounced worries among the Clintonsâ€™ closest advisers about the millions of dollars coming into the foundation, and to Mr. Clinton personally, and how they could inoculate Mrs. Clinton from criticism over it.â€œDo they plan to do big events next year?â€ her campaign manager, Robby Mook, asked about the foundation last year, shortly after Mrs. Clinton kicked off her presidential campaign. â€œPossible for those to be smaller and lower key in 16?â€Founded in 1997, when Mr. Clinton was still president, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion to fund projects around the world, helping African farmers improve their yields, Haitians recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake and millions of people gain access to cheaper H.I.V./AIDS medication, among other accomplishments.Some of the former presidentâ€™s staff members followed him from the White House to the foundation, and the emails provide an extraordinary look at the soap opera that unfolded years later as people close to the couple felt their power threatened.â€œThis is the 3rd time this week where she has gone to daddy to change a decision or interject herself,â€ Mr. Band, the longtime aide to Mr. Clinton, wrote about Chelsea Clinton in 2011.At the time, she was beginning to exert influence at the foundation, expressing concerns that Mr. Band and others were trying to use the charity to make money for themselves, and accusing another aide in her fatherâ€™s personal office of installing spyware.Emails released on Tuesday contained a memo from Mr. Band essentially defending his work for the foundation, and for Mr. Clinton personally, even as Mr. Band was building up his corporate consulting firm, Teneo. The memo noted that some foundation donors had indeed been clients of Teneo, but also that Mr. Band and Teneo had helped raise tens of millions of dollars for the foundation from individual, foreign and corporate donors, without taking a commission.Mr. Band also noted how some of those donors he had cultivated were paying Mr. Clinton privately to make speeches or to do other work. One such donor, Laureate International Universities, a for-profit education company based in Baltimore, was paying Mr. Clinton $3.5 million annually â€œto provide adviceâ€ and serve as its honorary chairman, Mr. Band wrote.In another email, Mr. Band wrote that Mr. Clinton had even received gifts from some donors.The tensions came to a head when Chelsea Clinton helped enlist an outside law firm to audit the Clinton Foundationâ€™s practices. Some interviewees told the audit team that the donors â€œmay have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gift.â€ The audit suggested the foundation â€œensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions.â€The advice proved prescient as Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny about whether donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special access to her State Department or other rewards. In August, the foundation said it would no longer accept foreign donations should Mrs. Clinton win the White House.Mrs. Clinton has dismissed criticism of the charity as politically motivated. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Glen Caplin, declined to verify the authenticity of the emails, but said the hack was part of the Russian governmentâ€™s efforts to use cyberattacks to influence the election in favor of the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump.Mr. Bandâ€™s firm released a statement saying: â€œTeneo worked to encourage clients, where appropriate, to support the Clinton Foundation because of the good work that it does around the world. It also clearly shows that Teneo never received any financial benefit or benefit of any kind from doing so.â€Behind the scenes, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s aides grappled with how to sever her from the problematic optics of some of the philanthropyâ€™s fund-raising practices.In an October 2014 email, Mr. Mook asked whether Mrs. Clintonâ€™s name would be used in connection with the foundation, which is formally known as the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. â€œIt will invite press scrutiny and sheâ€™ll be held accountable for what happens there,â€ he wrote.The next year, when Mrs. Clinton was on the verge of declaring her candidacy, Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and top aide, said she discussed with Mrs. Clinton various â€œstepsâ€ to take to adjust her relationship with the foundation, including her resignation from the foundationâ€™s board.By fall 2015, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s aides had fine-tuned her response to questions about foreign donors. â€œAs President, I wonâ€™t permit any conflicts between my work for the American people and the Foundationâ€™s good work,â€ aides advised Mrs. Clinton to say in a coming debate.The emails give insight into the periodic fires that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s advisers thought they had to put out. Mrs. Clinton ultimately did not attend the foundation event in Morocco that Ms. Abedin had complained about; her husband and daughter did go. It is unclear if the king had given the $12 million he was said to have pledged; he is not listed among the foundationâ€™s donors.In March 2015, Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian steel magnate who had given more than $10 million to the foundation, was â€œrelentlesslyâ€ requesting a meeting with Mr. Clinton, according to an aide, Amitabh Desai. If the former president declined, the relationship would be damaged, Mr. Desai wrote in an email.â€œNo is better. Is that viable?â€ wrote Mr. Podesta, who by then was the chairman of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign. It is unclear if the meeting took place.That same year, during a discussion over a potential meeting between Mr. Clinton and the Saudi king, Mr. Podesta replied, using the former presidentâ€™s initials, â€œNot something that would be on our top 10 list of WJC requests.â€Mr. Podesta took a leadership role at the charity when Bruce R. Lindsey, a former White House counsel and longtime friend of Mr. Clinton who had been chief executive of the foundation, had a stroke in 2011.His role at the foundation, coupled with his later capacity as the chairman of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign, put Mr. Podesta in the middle of internal workings of both operations and, by default, the delicate battles unfolding between Chelsea Clinton and her fatherâ€™s top aides.The day Mrs. Clintonâ€™s mother, Dorothy Rodham, died in 2011, Chelsea Clinton emailed Mr. Podesta. â€œDoug called and yelled and screamed at my Dad about how could he do this,â€ she said, a reference to the internal scrutiny going on at the foundation. â€œMy mother is exhausted, we are all heartbroken but we need a strategy and my father needs advice/counsel.â€Mr. Band has said the exchange described in the email never happened.Mr. Band, who helped Mr. Clinton build the foundation, clearly felt irritated by Chelsea Clintonâ€™s stream of implications that he had padded his own pockets from his work for her father.When Chelsea Clinton, using a pseudonym â€œDiane Reynolds,â€ that she also sometimes used to check into hotels, sent Mr. Band a complimentary email in January 2012, he forwarded it to Mr. Podesta and Ms. Mills.â€œAs they say, the apple doesnâ€™t fall far,â€ he wrote. â€œA kiss on the cheek while she is sticking the knife in the back, and front.â€",1

"Chemtrail Activist Patrick Roddie Testifies Before the EPABy Peter A. Kirby Here is a link to the entire hearing: Check out Patrick Roddies website http://stopsprayingus-sf.com Image Credit Peter Kirby is a San Rafael, CA researcher, writer and activist. Check out his ebook Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project. Follow Peter on Twitter @PeterAKirby Im all for this, but youre testifying in front of the EPA that more or less accidentally (hahahaha) spilled all the toxic waste into the Animas river. The same people who are more concerned about your charcoal grill than the massive radiation plume from Fukushima. They seem more interested in Superfund money than protecting anything for the citizenry We just do the best we can. If the people on the other end of the deal dont do what they are supposed to do, then that is on them. Not only that, but if the people on the other end of the deal (the EPA) dont do what they are supposed to, then they may be in trouble. I understand that the EPA says that they dont have jurisdiction over military aircraft, but that is putting the wagon before the horse. The EPA firstly needs to investigate THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF ALUMINUM AND BARIUM CONSISTENTLY SHOWING UP IN RAINWATER SAMPLES. After that investigation is complete, then we can talk about sources. Like Patrick said, the EPA needs to simply do their job. If they dont, they should be defunded. Has the EPA ever done 100% of their job? If they dont do their job, and are then defunded. does that solve anything? It would be a step in the right direction. I totally agree with you, Peter the EPA must simply do its job and if it doesnt, it must then be defunded NO EXCUSES Post proof of THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF ALUMINUM AND BARIUM CONSISTENTLY SHOWING UP IN RAINWATER SAMPLES. Since you apparently need me to hold your hand on this one, here you go: Rabid dog rums amuck, organization tasked with controlling the rabid dog, was created by the Rabid dog, gets its funding from the rabid dog. Now i want all who believe the EPA is going to ANYTHING about any of the things the Rabid Dog is up to, to hold their breath until it happens. I will cheer you on! Exactly! I knew in my heart of hearts the very moment I heard about this horrible toxic spill that the EPA had caused this intentionally, in order to declare a multizillion-dollar superfund site, where all the usual crony capitalists who sup at the public teat could get a nice payday out of cleaning up this accident. They are really fooling very few people these days. True the EPA is controlled and captured, however, this should be viewed as one of many strategies to get maximum exposure for the purpose of creating a tipping point of awareness. Some scientists within the EPA could become emboldened enough to speak out. Herndon has also blazed a trail. Wow, this thing is taking off like a rocket! Patrick, we have created a monster! Once again, please log in and up vote legitimate comments while down voting the droppings left by the hapless shills. The establishment backed trolls are falling in confusion. This issue is going mainstream. We can do this. Hapless shills: those with different opinions from your own. I wonder if youre a Democrat! LOL! Do you ever look up or just down because you are ashamed of yourself ? Its incredible how many shills have infiltrated the internet. 10 years ago it was nothing like this, we could speak openly about this sort of thing. Now the waters are muddied with thousands of liars who are paid to sit there and spew propaganda. Its really quite depressing. Take this Defiant clown above me as an good example. Always trying to shift the attention away to something else: I wonder if youre a Democrat!, always trying to make everything seem like a big joke: LOL!. Their tactics are blatantly obvious, and theyre everywhere. Pathetic low life scum. You really think everybody that disagrees with your lies is a paid shill? Paranoia has addled your brain. Patrick Roddie and the rest will be rightly ignored by the EPA. This was a hearing about real pollution, and they turned up and talked nonsense about chemtrails and geoengineering. Geoengineering is not and never has been carried out anywhere in the USA, so how can the EPA do anything about it? No, not just shills. I think there are a lot of morons out there too, like you for example. Group think has addled your brain. Learn to think for yourself, you might learn something for once in your naive and ignorant existence. Learn to think for yourself? Thats rich, coming from someone who unquestioningly parrots the chemtrail myth. Thinking for yourself does not mean letting YouTube videos do the thinking for you. It means using your brain. Try it some time. Dont worry, youll figure it out eventually. Youll figure it out when you grow up, and realise that nobody has been killed by contrails. Ever. Dont be angry, everything will be okay. Whether youre shill or not, how can you deny what you can see with your own eyes?? I dont deny what I see with my eyes. I live under a busy air traffic route and I see contrails. Lots and lots of them some days. I made the italian translation of your testifying in front of EPA and is now on many Italian facebook anti geoengineering pages and on my FB wall. TNX Patrick I posted the links to Patricks and the other anti chemtrail activists EPA Testimony in to this article that I just wrote http://ymlp.com/zikz74 where I also posted the link to the EPAs website encouraging everyone to file their own comments to the EPA to demand they take action to stop the spraying. I posted my own comments, and encouraged people to either echo mine, or post their own. I also provided a lot of info about detoxification so people can protect themselves from chemtrails. Please see my archived e-alerts at http://ymlp.com/archive_gjbeuhgjgu.php and if youd like to subscribe to my double opt in list, you can at http://www.iahf.com Flower seeds? GMO? Could you be more accurate and give examples? Patrick went on record about the hard evidence showing the mountains of metal raining down upon us and this Projects massive environmental fallout. That hard evidence doesnt actually show anything but that the metal is there. It does nothing to prove jets are spraying it into the sky. At all. another non-thinking sheep. Ever play follow the leader? I bet your an expert. For all you dumbfu#ks, like above, who failed math and science.please create a box model and determine the amount of chemicals that would have to be released in the air to create a harmful concentration to animals and humans. Since there is never any fallout recorded from supposed chemtrail spraying, the concentrations must be low (if youre talking particulates). You will see from a mass balance perspective, that millions of tons of chemicals would have to be released to create an airborne concentration in a hypothetical box (height x width x length) that is unhealthy to humans. Since demand for those chemicals would be extremely high, perhaps you can tell me what metal or chemicals have skyrocketed in price over the past 10 years. None! In fact, most commodities like metals are at all-time low prices. The idiot above is a perfect example of a troll or the typical uneducated ignorant american. I worked on behalf of industry (across the table from the USEPA) for 18 years as a toxicologist which entailed analyzing potential health risks to humans from exposure to chemicals in the environment. Once again, you have no clue nor will you ever. I suggest schooling and intense research into mathmatics, environmental science, atmospheric modeling, chemistry and toxicology. They are not indiscriminately dropping chemicals on you. If you turn your brain on you will realize that no one can be eliminated from this type of potential exposures, including the supposed culprits behind your myth. If your brain was turned on you would realize the bigger issue is those chemicals found in food and water including GMOs. You are easily distracted hitman which makes your kind the fools among us. The fools that believe myths and act on them. Fools that ruin it for those of us who understand. Thats why we will have a hard time winning against them.because of fools like you who believe whatever you are told and have no capacity for critical thinking. The best you can do for all of us is remove yourself from social discussion on matters you know nothing about. Have we totally lost our sense of humor here? Eunsah is joking about how oblivious weve become to the obviousi.e., arent those crazy lines in the sky beautiful? Theyre so artistically done, how could they possibly hurt us? He is either addressing deniers that they even exist, or those who refuse to see them, or to those who see them but adamantly insist they are contrails. Only the best of intentions can be attributed to whatever entity has commandeered our , skiesthey must be the good guys, just like the USA always wears a white hat. Therefore, expect a big crop of beautiful flowers full of resurrected disappearing bees and new trees sprouting up to replace all those that have died for no reason, the oceans returning to normal, the rivers cleansing themselvesall due to there being no spraying of the skies. What a wonderful world! Now, if hes NOT joking, hes a shill and we have a real problem here. The EPA is quite aware of whats been falling from the skies for years. They are, after all, a federal agency, and therefore in the know. Patrick Roddie has joined the other fraudsters by fleecing money from the gullible followers on Gofundme. Wake up chemtrail sheeple, these guys know exactly what they are doing. Ive been speaking out for years to my family about this and they are finally starting to wake up and realize that something is amiss about our skies while commuting/driving to work. You can even smell it in the air on some days. In that case, Paul, that agency sorely needs to change its name to something other than Environmental Protection Agency a good name for this entity would be Pollution Protection Agency Now that would definitely be the correct name for it, since it protects polluters such as geo-engineering entities. It boils down to this. Will the police and military turn on the elite? The answer is a few but not enough. We have to have the brute force might to physically stop this from happening and we dont have it. Were sitting ducks. Americans will do anything the elite ask them for enough money. The funny part is they just kill you after you do it so you never get a chance to spend the money anyway. Idiots. Any nation born through genocide and slavery deserves the same fate. And no it wasnt whites that did it. Jewish elites did and then lied about in history books, on TV and the internet. The worst part is we all believed the lies. Thats how we got here. YOU ARE IN THE MATRIX!!!! Its not just a movie. Wake up. Its take one day to reverse this if we are all on board. Think about it.all this damage and we cant stop it that soon but the global Jewish elite and their servants have to be arrested, tried and executed..If not executed then isolated forever. If not we are all going to die..soon. And why do you think a video of persistent contrails would be of interest to anybody? They have been common knowledge for 75 years now. Get with the 21st century. Patrick, when will you correct all of the multiple errors in your report? Water changing phase from vapour to ice does not equal shit. Moron. Hilarious. ",0
"Dear Diary:My husband and I, World War II survivors from Poland, arrived in New York on March 16, 1948, on a dilapidated transport ship. We were taken to the Latham Hotel at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue. The next morning, my husband, an avid photographer, woke me with a kiss. He was dressed and off to take pictures. â€œPresident Truman will be in New York,â€ he said, â€œand I must take photos.â€ Then he was quickly out the door.â€œIt is my first day in America,â€ I thought. â€œI must see President Truman in person.â€ Wanting to look elegant, I put on a dress, plus clothes I had picked out from the American Red Cross in Bremen, Germany: a fur-lined housecoat, high heels and a hat with a long pheasant feather.Knowing little English, I asked in the hotel lobby if anyone spoke French or German. A woman answered in German. She said President Truman would be reviewing the St. Patrickâ€™s Day parade, and told me to go to the library on 42nd Street. Negotiating my way through the crowds, I began to sweat. I became confused: The street was totally empty. So I went around the barriers and walked freely on Fifth Avenue. Suddenly I heard clop, clop, clop and a stern voice. â€œWhere do you think you are going?â€ It was a police officer on a horse.I held up my index finger. â€œFirst day in America,â€ I said. â€œSee President Truman.â€ In one motion, the policeman lifted me up and placed me in front of him on the horse. I was convinced he was taking me to jail. Soon, from a distance, I saw a huge building with stairs and many men in black hats. The officer pointed to a reviewing stand and said, â€œPresident Truman.â€ Then he deposited me back on the street. â€œWelcome to America.â€",1
"Richard (*not his real name) has seen the best and the worst of Airtasker, the popular job outsourcing platform.  At the best of times, it has allowed him to work for pay rates comparable to a permanent job and helped build a client base for his thriving business that employs eight staff. But, in a sign of what can go wrong, on a gardening job he nabbed on Airtasker Richard discovered asbestos, which he recognised from his own recent home renovation. Richard immediately stopped the job and came to no harm. But the prospect of someone less savvy coming across the deadly material raises concerns about the responsibility for workersâ€™ compensation insurance on a digital platform where â€œworkâ€ is not the same as a â€œjobâ€. It is issues such as workersâ€™ compensation, as well as minimum rates of pay and superannuation, that are behind the decision by Unions NSW, an Australian state union body, to consider a test case against Airtasker. The essence of the case is whether workers who find jobs on Airtasker are independent contractors, running their own businesses, or are really disguised employees.   Related: With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?   The unions say the extent of Airtaskerâ€™s control over work suggests it may be the employer. They point to Airtasker taking a 15% cut of earnings, regulating the behaviour of workers including by removing them from the platform, providing mediation of disputes and restricting workers from further outsourcing tasks.  Workers are â€œdependent on Airtasker to find tasksâ€, the unions say, like a labour hire company that hires workers and then assigns them jobs at other companies. Airtaskerâ€™s chief executive, Tim Fung, told Guardian Australia there were a â€œspectrum of platformsâ€ from Yellow Pages, which is a form of open marketplace that has â€œvery little control over what actually happens on the jobâ€, to labour hire agencies, which control every detail down to what workers wear and how much they charge.  â€œI would say Airtasker sits on the side of being like a marketplace,â€ he says. A labour law expert, Prof Andrew Stewart, sees a potential defence for Airtasker here.  â€œAirtasker will argue if [itâ€™s] like anyone [itâ€™s] like a recruitment broker ... it simply takes money to introduce a worker to an organisation that will hire their services,â€ he says. Before launching the case, Unions NSW is hoping to force Airtasker to negotiate better pay and conditions. Itâ€™s not the first case of its kind, as Maurice Blackburn will imminently launch a similar â€œsham contractingâ€ case against food bike courier services Deliveroo and Foodora.  A similar case in California found that Uber drivers were employees, showing the number of digital business models that can be challenged. Itâ€™s another front in a battle between unions and digital platforms that unions say â€“ far from creating the future of work â€“ are taking us back to poor conditions like no guarantee of work and flat pay rates. The secretary of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, says it picked Airtasker because of â€œthe breadth of the disruptionâ€ from its business model. â€œWhat we found most annoying is it was targeting jobs performed by those with limited or no skills in the current employment environment,â€ he says. â€œThe expectation with disruption is that itâ€™s about new and better jobs â€“ what this actually does is attack low-paid jobs and drives them into being further underpaid.â€ A look at the most common job listings on Airtasker lends weight to the concern â€“ the most common are for tradies, cleaners, removalists, deliveries, gardening and office administration. In a report on Airtaskerâ€™s business model, Unions NSW said that jobs such as cleaning should be paid a minimum rate of $23.64 an hour but the rate recommended by Airtasker, $20, would result in just $17 an hour pay after its 15% fee is taken out. Fung counters that many of the jobs are novel and could not be done on a permanent basis, such as assembling Ikea furniture, or â€œmicro jobsâ€ such as buying groceries for an elderly neighbour when you planned to go to the grocery store anyway. Minimum pay rates are less relevant because a skilful plumber or a whiz at assembling furniture with the right kind of drill can do the job quicker, he says. Responding to the claim of low pay, Fung says â€œthe price of tasks is going up because workers are taking control of the platform and setting their own priceâ€.  Thatâ€™s how the platform works â€“ job posters can ask you to clean their house for $50 but workers are not obliged to do the job at such a low price if they donâ€™t want to.    Related: The dark side of Uber: why the sharing economy needs tougher rules | Greg Jericho   Graphs provided by Airtasker show the average agreed task price rose from just under $75 to more than $110 between 2013 and 2016. It looks like a pay rise but itâ€™s hard to tell without knowing how long the jobs take workers to complete. Guardian Australia spoke to three workers who performed jobs on Airtasker and their experiences bore out both the hype and the concern with the platform. Annie Wylie, a former communications manager in between jobs, performed one job as a â€œmystery shopperâ€ to test a restaurant in Newtown, Sydney, and recorded a companyâ€™s voicemail message for $30. â€œI was super happy with it as a flat rate â€“ the voicemails I could do really quickly and wouldnâ€™t require much editing â€¦ and with the mystery shopping I had to go to dinner and got a discount on my meal,â€ she says. â€œIâ€™d do that anyway, plus I get some money.â€ But Wylie â€“ who joined Airtasker after leaving her last job â€“ finds work on the platform more aligned with her professional skills such as social media management and PR work harder to win. â€œIâ€™ve bid on a couple of them. I do tend to bid on the basis of an hourly rate. I havenâ€™t got any of those yet â€“ the rates are quite low and Iâ€™m not willing to do [the work] for that much.â€ Sergio Gianni works about 20 hours a week on Airtasker, mostly as a removalist but occasionally assembling Ikea furniture or making deliveries. Gianni used to run his own hospitality business and joined Airtasker because it was the quickest way to make money while in between jobs. â€œI wouldnâ€™t be able to do what I do today if I were looked at as an employee,â€ he says. â€œFor a contractor, maybe it would be better to be employees and get more benefits. But, from the consumer point of view, it will hurt the growth of this market. People will not pay the same price [for Airtasker jobs].â€ He says asking for higher rates is â€œup to the person ... up to meâ€ and â€œnothing to do with the unions or whoeverâ€. But one thing Gianni agrees with the unions on is that Airtasker should provide insurance that covers workers. Airtasker provides public liability insurance for third-party injury and property damage. â€œThe policy does not cover first-person personal injury or property damage for the Airtasker worker and should not be considered a replacement for workers compensation, salary protection or other similar types of insurance,â€ its website says. The insurance policy also excludes many job categories including building work, fitness training, event planners, plumbing, transport and taxi services. And then thereâ€™s Richard, who found asbestos on the gardening job. â€œI get a pathway to meet people who have great privilege â€“ I have met movie producers, people who own Rolls-Royces and get to work in remarkable places,â€ he says. â€œI donâ€™t do gardening shifts anymore after that.â€ All three workers mention that they are free to take or leave jobs, which will be central to Airtaskerâ€™s defence in any sham contracting case. Variations on that defence are offered by Foodora, Deliveroo and Uber when asked if theyâ€™re concerned about the application of a case to their business models. Stewart says cases against Airtasker and other digital platforms would rely on courts â€œlooking past the contractual arrangement to the actual situationâ€. A copy of the Uber driver contract published by Fairfax Media exhibits a high degree of control of working conditions, according to Stewart. For example, Uber reserves the right to deactivate its driversâ€™ account and restrict them from using the app. And because Uberâ€™s app sets the price of a fare, workers effectively have a cap on how much they earn. An Uber spokesman says that â€œdriver partners have full control over when, how often and for how long they drive, meaning they can log in and out of the app whenever they chooseâ€. He adds that drivers are free to work across multiple apps, another factor that may make a court less likely to find its drivers are employees. Although he declines to make a prediction on how any cases would turn, Stewart says it is â€œinherently more plausible that Airtasker is simply connecting people that want to provide work with those that want to use their servicesâ€ than Uber, which â€œis a brand associated with transportation servicesâ€. A Foodora spokeswoman says it is confident it is not exploiting any loopholes in the way it engages delivery drivers, while a Deliveroo spokeswoman says its drivers are independent contractors. â€œWe offer work in the form of deliveries. However, riders select where they wish to work and when they are available to accept orders and provide services for Deliveroo,â€ she says.   Related: Is this the future of work? Scientists predict which jobs will still be open to humans in 2035   The impact of the test cases against Airtasker and Foodora and Deliveroo could be much wider than on just their business models and their workers. Stewart says the countryâ€™s system of people funding their own retirement through superannuation relies on workers having employers to pay a compulsory contribution. â€œIf workers generate their income through being contractors rather than employees ... apart from anything else, itâ€™s going to hurt the superannuation system and put more of a burden on the federal budget.â€ Stewart says the issue needs to be studied further. Although about 1m Australians work as independent contractors in their main job, a stable 10% over the past 10 to 15 years, it remains to be seen whether the gig economy will drive an increase in that number. He says the government would need to consider legislative responses including changes to labour law, tax, superannuation, safety, injury compensation and even welfare, after the Productivity Commission said the rise of the gig economy and automation could require consideration of a universal basic income. For unions the task is clearer â€“ with the Airtasker case, they hope to exert some industrial pressure so that workers have more choice than merely to work or not to work. And there may be some middle ground. Fung says he is relaxed about increasing recommended pay rates because Airtasker would take a cut of a bigger pie if users responded positively. Itâ€™s the tug of war between what users will pay and workers will work for that is barely mediated by the Airtasker platform at all. If Unions NSW and the Maurice Blackburn cases donâ€™t succeed, it will be no business of employment law either. Then the future of work will have arrived.",1
"The secret CIA program to kill top al-Qaida leaders with assassination teams was outsourced in 2004 to Blackwater USA, the private security contractor whose operations in Iraq prompted intense scrutiny, according to two former intelligence officials familiar with the events. The North Carolina-based company was given operational responsibility for targeting terrorist commanders and was awarded millions of dollars for training and weaponry, but the program was canceled before any missions were conducted, the two officials said. The assassination program -- revealed to Congress in June by CIA Director Leon Panetta -- was initially launched in 2001 as a CIA-led effort to kill or capture top al-Qaida using the agency's paramilitary forces. But in 2004, after briefly terminating the program, agency officials decided to revive it under a different code name, using outside contractors, the officials said. 'Outsourcing gave the agency more protection in case something went wrong,' said a retired intelligence officer intimately familiar with the assassination program. The contract was awarded to Blackwater, now known as Xe Services LLC, in part because of its close ties to the CIA and because of its record for carrying out covert assignments overseas, the officials said. The security contractor's senior management has included high-ranking former CIA officials, including Cofer Black, the agency's former top counterterrorism official, who joined the company in early 2005, three months after leaving the CIA. The plan to kill top al-Qaida leaders was thrust into the spotlight in July, shortly after Panetta briefed members of two congressional panels about the program. Panetta told House and Senate leaders that he had only recently learned of the program and, upon doing so, had canceled it. Panetta also told lawmakers that he thought they had been inappropriately kept in the dark about the plan -- in part because former Vice President Diock Cheney had directed the CIA not to reveal the program to Congress. The CIA declined comment Wednesday about Blackwater's alleged involvement in the program, which was first reported Wednesday night on the Web site of the New York Times. Efforts to reach Blackwater for comment late Wednesday were unsuccessful. Agency officials again defended Panetta's decision to terminate the effort and notify congressional overseers. 'Director Panetta thought this effort should be briefed to Congress, and he did so,' CIA spokesman George Little said. 'He also knew it hadn't been successful, so he ended it. Neither decision was difficult. This was clear and straightforward.' The House intelligence committee has launched an investigation into whether the CIA broke the law by failing to notify Congress about the program for eight years. Current and former agency officials have disputed claims by some Democratic lawmakers that the withholding of key details of the program was illegal. 'Director Panetta did not tell the committees that the agency had misled the Congress or had broken the law,' Little said. 'He decided that the time had come to brief Congress on a counterterrorism effort that was, in fact, much more than a PowerPoint presentation.' ",1
"Brave New YearWe can, if we so desire, refuse to cooperate with the blind forces that are propelling us. Aldous Huxley So here we are, moving into 2014. And no doubt with that sense of expectancy and promise which comes with all New Years. But maybe also with that nagging sense which has its foundation in the fact that the previous year may not have quite lived up to expectations? For example all those events both cosmic and earthly that were supposed to have caused some grand disruption to the abysmal status quo and its dumbed down daily grind what happened to them? How is it that even the widely predicted great financial collapse has so far managed to stall and its proponents prophesies likewise put on hold? Even visiting comets seem to have been unable to pull-off a much hoped for mighty upheaval to the sterile patterns imposed upon the human race. Consequently, the relentless bankster/government top-down squeeze on both the economic viability and civil liberties of working men and women, continues unabated. So now might just be the right time to do a reality check on hopes and expectations for 2014. To help ground our aspirations and expectations, I would like to draw-on a lessen from history concerning the ever illusive ebb and flow in the tides of man. In endeavouring to do this, I am putting together a number of prescient quotes from Aldous Huxleys last major piece of writing Brave New World Revisited. This work was published in 1958 thats fifty six years ago and yet it remains as starkly resonant today as it must have appeared back then for anyone who had ears to hear. We will be reminded, at a glance, just how well laid are the foundations of the seemingly impenetrable oligarchy that still holds the majority of humanity under its spell to this day; just how deep is the quagmire that has sucked so many into its oozing grasp; just how steeped in delusion remains the greater part of the human population. Huxley: ..Many sociologists and psychologists have written at length and with deep concern, about the price that Western man has had to pay and will go on paying for technological progress. They point out, for example, that democracy can hardly be expected to flourish in societies where political and economic power is being progressively concentrated and centralized. But the progress of technology has lead, and is still leading, to just such concentration of power. As the machinery of mass-production is being made more efficient it tends to become more complex and more expensive and so less available to the enterpriser of limited means. Moreover, mass production cannot work without mass distribution; but mass distribution raises problems which only the largest producers can satisfactorily solve. In a World of mass production and mass consumption the Little Man, with his inadequate stock of working capitol, is at a grave disadvantage. In competition with the Big Man, he loses his money and finally his very existence as an independent producer; the Big Man has gobbled him up. As the Little Men disappear, more and more economic power comes to be wielded by fewer and fewer people. Well isnt that exactly what we witness today at the hands of the Walmarts, Unilevers and Monsantos of this world? Yet Huxley clearly recognizes that this trend was well under-way in the early 1950s and that the Little Man was already under the cosh of an increasingly centralised corporate cabal which threatened to crush him completely. What he did not add at least here was the equally crushing level of environmental pollution and destruction that was to accompany the progress of this vast corporate machine. We see then, that modern technology has led to the concentration of economic and political power, and to the development of a society controlled (ruthlessly in the totalitarian states, politely and inconspicuously in the democracies) by Big Business and Big Government. But societies are composed of individuals and are good only so far as they help individuals to realize their potentialities and to lead a happy and fruitful life. How have individuals been affected by the technological advances of recent years? The answer to this question is provided here by respected philosopher-psychiatrist, Dr Erich Fromm: Our contemporary Western Society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure . Let us beware of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symptoms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting. Huxley adds that the really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal and Fromm continues Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. In other words, continues Huxley They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish the illusion of individuality but in fact they have been to a great extent de-individualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. Fromm ends this passage by stating Uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed. Huxley then makes a particularly salient statement In the course of evolution nature has gone to endless trouble to see that every individual is unlike every other individual. We reproduce our kind by bringing the fathers genes into contact with the mothers. These hereditary factors may be combined in an almost infinite number of ways. Physically and mentally, each one of us is unique. Any culture which, in the interests of efficiency or in the name of some political or religious dogma, seeks to standardize the human individual, commits an outrage against mans biological nature. How similar this is to Krishnamurtis observation: It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. Fromm (with whom I had a short correspondence circa 1980) saw how the capacity for love was being strangled by the machine like advances of the age of consumerism, citing the frenetic drive for work as one of the classic escapist symptoms of those most unwilling to explore the true source of their problems. The searing truth which emerges from all this is inescapable it hits us like a ton of wet cement: we have been and continue to be, operating within an essentially insane set of norms. Norms that demand our constant adjustment; that is, if we choose not to become estranged from our workmates and ridiculed by those with whom we share our daily experiences, hopes and fears. RD Laing, the radical psychiatrist, opened his infamous rehabilitation centre in London based on this same insight. He helped unadapted, shcizoid outcasts find shelter and support while a regimented conformist society marched on ridiculing such initiatives as heresy. Turning to the wider social sphere Huxley states It is the social sphere, in the realm of politics and economics, that the Will of Order becomes really dangerous. Here the theoretical reduction of unmanageable multiplicity to comprehensible unity, becomes the practical reduction of human diversity to subhuman uniformity, of freedom to servitude. Ah yes, an unavoidable observation for anyone who has eyes to see today. Then on the urban dilemma But life in the large cities is not conducive to mental health nor does it foster the kind of responsible freedom within small self governing groups which is the first condition of a genuine democracy. Then somewhat later he adds We know that it is unsafe to allow power to be concentrated in the hands of a ruling oligarchy; nevertheless power is in fact being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. We know that, for most people, life in a huge modern city is anonymous, atomic, less than fully human; nevertheless the huge cities grow steadily huger and the pattern of urban industrial living remains unchanged. We know that in a very large complex society, democracy is almost meaningless except in relation to autonomous groups of manageable size; nevertheless more and more of every nations affairs are managed by the bureaucrats of Big Government and Big Business. Here the theme of autonomous groups of manageable size is returned to once again. It is undoubtedly the key for both survival and eventual emancipation for the rump of humanity. It is what I put forward in Quit the Matrix Build the Ark and other related essays as well as increasingly in practice at our Polish workshops and as much as possible in daily life. Huxley recognises that a countryside setting is needed for this form of community to take root. However, he does not completely rule-out the possibility of an urban revival, but only in circumstance in which many village like caring and sharing communities are formed within the greater urban area. I would add that a radical greening of the concrete jungle would be another indispensable corollary. The author of Brave New World Revisited goes on That we are being propelled in the direction of Brave New World is obvious. But no less obvious is the fact that we can, if we so desire, refuse to cooperate with the blind forces that are propelling us. For the moment, however, the wish to resist does seem to be very strong or very widespread. Yes, and remember that was more than fifty years ago any more strong or widespread today? On broadly the same theme he states To give organisations precedence over persons is to subordinate ends to means In the more efficient dictatorships of the future there will probably be much less violence than under Hitler and Stalin. The future dictators subjects will be painlessly regimented by a corps of highly trained Social Engineers. There can be little doubt that social engineering is permanently at work in 21st century society. Painless it may not be, but effective it certainly is. Huxleys famous treatise on the power of government and corporate propaganda in Brave New World is reviewed in his return to its contents thus: They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account mans almost infinite appetite for distractions. This almost limitless appetite for distractions was to reach epidemic proportions after Huxleys death and remains at the heart of millions of listless, restless, fear-driven lifestyles to this day; spurred on by a mass media in the servile employ of the ever watchful controlling government/corporate cabal. It was in June 1926 that Huxley made his first trip to the USA, and it was reportedly this experience that made him so pessimistic about the future of Europe. In Jesting Pilate he writes The thing which is happening in America is a revaluation of values a radical alteration for the worse of established standards. Brave New World is modelled on this insight, and he never made peace with Hollywood Syndrome or the fascination of the superficial facade of modernity that still grips the US Continent to this day. Huxley also harboured a nagging preoccupation with overpopulation, leading him to state that, should it continue unabated, most of humanity would face a choice between anarchy and totalitarian control. But, as we saw earlier, he also recognized that technological progress presented an equally daunting threat to humanity, stating: Technological progress has merely provided us with a more efficient means of going backwards. He longed for a resolution to the seemingly endless calamitous state of humanity and in Brave New World Revisited he writes: Almost all of us long for peace and freedom, but very few of us have much enthusiasm for the thoughts, feelings and actions that make for peace and freedom. Conversely, almost nobody wants war or tyranny; but a great many people find intense pleasure in the thoughts, feelings and actions that make for war and tyranny. On the penultimate page of Brave New World Revisited he touches the raw nerve of democratic failings in post industrial society: That so many of the well-fed young television-watchers of the Worlds most powerful democracy should be so indifferent to the idea of self-government; so blankly uninterested in freedom of thought and the right to dissent, is distressing, but not too surprising. Then at at the end he strikes a more optimistic note saying The young people who now think so poorly of democracy may grow up to become fighters for freedom. The cry Give me television and hamburgers may give place, under altered circumstances, to the cry Give me liberty or give me death. I have put all this before us because I believe we need reminding. Reminding of the fragility of human freedoms and the fact that if we dont fight for them we will lose them. We can now see, that back in 1958, all the symptoms and indeed manifestations of an oligarchical hierarchy were already strongly in evidence. This fact should serve to prompt us into realising that it has been inaction by a broad swathe of the populous since that time (and before) that is responsible for allowing the unguarded door of freedom to be pushed further and further open. Pushed open to the point where the Centralised Superstate is being offered the almost unopposed opportunity of riding roughshod over the last line of our civil liberties and imposing a potentially irrevocable dictatorship over the entire populous. In 2014, we may well be faced with just such a prospect. Yet, with propitious use of our gathering spiritual energies poured into the most appropriate, purposeful actions, we can still fend-off and ultimately dismantle the heinous military industrial complex and its power obsessed puppet rulers. We can, must and will push back the vampiric power-mongers and lay the ground for the self-governing community based cantons that Huxley so clearly foresaw as the most propitious antidote of the police state that is now at our door. Let 2014 be the year we take back control of our destinies!

"JERUSALEM â€” Israel and Turkey agreed on Sunday to resume full diplomatic relations, ending a bitter, six-year rift between the once-close regional allies, according to Israeli and Turkish officials.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was scheduled to announce the deal in Rome on Monday, according to the Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity from Rome because the accord had not yet been formally made public. The Turkish government planned to make a parallel announcement in Ankara.The two countries fell out after a deadly confrontation in 2010 between Israeli commandos and Turkish activists on a passenger vessel that tried to breach Israelâ€™s naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal territory that is under the control of Hamas, the Islamic militant group.The ship, the Mavi Marmara, was part of a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza when Israeli naval commandos rappelled onto the shipâ€™s deck and killed nine activists after being met with violent resistance. A 10th activist later died of his wounds.Negotiating teams for the two countries met in Rome over the weekend.Mr. Netanyahu left for Rome on Sunday, and was also scheduled to meet there with Secretary of State John Kerry and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. Mr. Netanyahu said those meetings would focus on regional matters, including relations with the Palestinians, as well as security and other concerns.Reconciliation between Israel and Turkey, two important allies of the United States, has long been an American interest as Washington confronts civil war in Syria and broader instability in the region.Turkey was once Israelâ€™s closest friend in the Muslim world, and the two countries still share many strategic interests, including containing Iran.Before leaving for Rome, Mr. Netanyahu responded to criticism from the families of two Israeli soldiers whose remains are being held by Hamas in Gaza, as well as relatives of one of two Israeli civilians being held captive by Hamas.Turkey maintains close political ties with Hamas, and over the weekend President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Khaled Meshal, the exiled political chief of Hamas, in Istanbul, according to the official Anadolu Agency, which quoted presidential sources.The families have demanded that any agreement with Turkey include the return of the captives as well as the remains of the soldiers.Speaking at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday morning, Mr. Netanyahu said, â€œWe are continuing our constant efforts, both open and in secret, to bring back to Israel Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, may their memories be blessed, and also the two Israelis being held in Gaza.â€He was referring to two soldiers who were killed in the 2014 war in Gaza by name, and to Avera Mengistu, an Israeli Jew of Ethiopian descent, and another Israeli citizen from a Bedouin town in the Negev desert, who has not been officially named. Both civilians crossed into Gaza of their own accord, without authorization.The Israeli official in Rome said Mr. Erdogan had agreed to a document separate from the main accord that would instruct the relevant Turkish agencies to help resolve the issue of the Israelis missing in Gaza.Many of the terms of the deal between Israel and Turkey are similar to those announced in December, when officials said a preliminary understanding had been reached. Israel is to pay about $20 million into a compensation fund for the families of those killed on the Mavi Marmara. Turkey, in turn, is to drop criminal charges it had filed against Israeli officers.Israel also expects the Turkish authorities to prevent Hamas operatives in Turkey from orchestrating attacks against Israel. According to the Turkish official, Turkey will be allowed to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and invest in infrastructure projects in Gaza and the West Bank.Israel and Turkey will return ambassadors to each otherâ€™s capitals and will discuss building a pipeline to bring natural gas from Israel to Turkey.Yuval Steinitz, Israelâ€™s minister of national infrastructure, energy and water, said that Israel and Turkey had â€œan interest in preventing Syria from turning into an Iranian military baseâ€ and that Israel was not easing up on Hamas by reaching an agreement with Turkey.â€œCertainly we are not conceding anything that is vital to our defense or security,â€ Mr. Steinitz told Israel Radio.It has been more than three years since President Obama pressed Mr. Netanyahu to call Mr. Erdogan, then the prime minister of Turkey, to apologize for the Marmara episode. That telephone call, at the end of a 2013 visit by Mr. Obama to Israel, was supposed to clear the way for reconciliation, but there were many false starts as Israel and Turkey failed to agree on terms.",1
"Why are AR-15s Personal Defense Weapons for the DHS but Assault Rifles for Citizens?We are fast approaching the stage of ultimate inversion: the stage where government is free to do as it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission. Ayn Rand Why are fully-automatic AR-15s with 30-round magazines and hollow-point bullets called personal defense weapons when the Department of Homeland Security purchases them, but semi-auto AR-15s are assault rifles in the hands of citizens? Increasingly the government is giving itself privileges that they are taking away from citizens. This is becoming most obvious in regards to gun rights, but its becoming a widespread abuse of power across all aspects of society. The government is supposed to derive its authority from the people not the other way around. If we are to be a nation of, by and for the people where the government has no rights that arent afforded to citizens, then this assumption may be the check on government overreach thats so desperately needed.

"US House approves new Benghazi inquiryChris Carrington Four Americans including US Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed. The 11 September 2012 attack, in which gunmen stormed the US compound and set it on fire, has become a political lightning rod. The Republicans have accused the Obama administration of covering up the involvement of militant groups in the days after the attack in order to protect President Barack Obamas 2012 re-election campaign. The White House initially said the attack was sparked by protests about an anti-Islam video produced in the US. Ahead of the vote on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner promised an eminently fair investigation to answer questions stemming from the attack. Republicans have been very critical of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is now weighing a 2016 presidential run. Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the panel will be too partisan in nature and have accused conservatives of using it to energise Republican voters prior to midterm elections in November.

"Obama and Netanyahu Use Propaganda to Cover Their Plan to Attack IranSusanne Posel, Contributor A clear red line must be set forth for Iran not to cross, suggestsNetanyahu. This is a brutal regime that is racing ahead with its nuclear program, because it doesnt see a clear red line from the international community. The greater the resolve and the clearer the red line, the less likely well have conflict. Netanyahu claims that anti-Semitic remarks were made by Iran at a recent UN meeting. Allegedly, Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saidIsrael is an insult to humankind. Last month, more verbal bashingresulted from General Amir Ali Hajizadeh of the Revolutionary Guards supposedly saying that if Israel strikes Iran, they will be blown into the dustbin of history. Hajizadeh continued: Irans response to any practical threat to or aggression against the Islamic Republic will be very fast, categorical, destructive, and overarching. General Martin Dempsey, member of the US Joint Cheifs of Staff has come out to explicitly saythat he is not in accord with the US military being used for Israeli agendas. Gilad Erdan, Israeli Environment Protection Minister explains: Dempseys comments dont compute with statements made by the White House spokesman with regards to the strength of the relationship between Israel and the US. Israel needs to maintain its right to defend itself, it is the right thing to do and Israel will not place its security in the hands of others. The mainstream media arereportingthat Obama is trying to talk Israel out of an offensive military show of force against Iran; however Obama is cryptic when it comes to his promises of support to Netanyahu. More propaganda set to frameIran is being touted in a threat relayed by Hezbollah (the state-funded terrorist group) that Iran will attack US bases if Israel follows through with their strike against nuclear power facilities. Iran is taking Netanyahus threat seriously with US plannednaval exercises with antimissile systems in the Persian Gulf and stricter sanctions on Iranian oil. Yet, this all plays into the scripted agreement between Obama and Netanyahu for plans against Iran. In New York, at the UN General Assembly, Netanyahu and Obama discussedtheir plans to use military and propaganda to justify and cover their agenda against Iran. In their scenario,Obama will inform Congress in writing that he will use military force against Iran in response to their alleged nuclear weapons program. In asking for their approval, Obama could be enabled to circumvent their decision. It is decided that Obama will speak in Israel just weeks before the US elections wherein he will devote the US military to Israels plan to attack sovereign Islamic nations. Paralleling this strategy, the federal intelligence and surveillance agencies in the US will be upgraded so that regardless of who is elected this November, the US government will be equipped with the necessary resources to attack Iran. This is slated for the spring of 2013. linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0
"Taiwan emerged as the biggest winner at the British Invention Show 2010 (BIS) that ended Saturday, capturing 12 gold and two silvers, as well as special awards of diamond, platinum and double-gold medals. Taiwan submitted 19 entries to the UK's largest invention and technology exhibition and garnered its best score in the four years since it first participated in the event. Sixteen countries took part this year. Katharine Chang, Taiwan's representative to the U.K., and Chen Tsung-chieh, head of the the economic division of Taiwan's representative office in London, both extended congratulations to the winners. Chen Tsung-tai, president of the Taiwan Invention Association and leader of the Taiwanese team, said that pieces invented by Taiwan's youth amazed the judges with their creativity and innovative ideas, adding that these young people represented the hopes of the future and the keys to improving Taiwan's competitiveness. Kane Kramer, president of the assembly and founder of the British Inventors Society, said at the award presentation ceremony that he was attracted by the top award entry, a multi-channel headphone system submitted by Taiwan's Cotron Corp, describing it as a well-deserved winner. Kramer, inventor of the first digital audio player and whose work helped inspire the design of Apple's iPod, said he would work together with a Taiwanese firm regarding his latest invention. The headphone system has won contracts from Japan and the United States, Lin Pi- fen, a director of the Cotron Corp, said. Another Cotron invention, a wireless audio player, also won the special platinum medal, making the company the biggest winner at the event. A student team from Far East University in Tainan won four gold medals for its coffee machine capable of adjusting caffeine content and aroma strength, a device designed to completely destroy information stored on a CD disc, a water- saving planting container, and a solar-powered vacuum tube heat collector. The five-member team from the Affiliated Experimental High School of Tunghai University earned two golds with its new video monitor and PC Mirror Cam. The team's youngest winner, 12-year-old Chi Yu-chen, said 'I feel good that I could transfer ideas to inventions.' Held Oct. 13-16 in London's Alexandra Palace, the show attracted more than 130 entries from around the world. ",1

"Experts Admit Conspiracy Theorists Right About Rigged Stock MarketMac Slavo Do bears crap in the woods? The NY Posts controversial columnist John Crudele has thrown down the gauntlet, declaring that the market is rigged. And not only does everyone know it, but it is now being admitted. The stock market is rigged. When I started making that claim years ago and provided solid evidence people scoffed. Some called it a conspiracy theory, tinfoil hats and that sort of stuff. Most people just ignored me. But thats not happening anymore. The dirty secret is out. Ed Yardeni, a longtime Wall Street guru who isnt one of the clowns of the bunch, said flat out last week that the market was being propped up. These markets are all rigged, and I dont say that critically. I just say that factually, he asserted on CNBC. Yardenis claim is the most basic one: that the Federal Reserve wont do anything that will upset Wall Street and, in fact, is doing all it can to help the stock market. So the Federal Reserve is propping up Wall Street, and the economy by extension, not only by issuing free money through QE3, but buying up bonds and shares as well. This form of manipulation extends globally, with many other central banks propping up the market, and even the U.S. government as a means of covert proxy investment: The Bank of Japan and other central bankers around the world could easily be purchasing shares of American companies to help out the US stock market. And Japan could even be doing it with the blessing of Washington, which is afraid any direct intervention in equities on its part would be discovered by nosy people like me. Last fall, we learned that one American exchange has made intervention in rigging foreign governments easier and cheaper to accomplish. In October, it emerged that CME Group, the Chicago exchange that trades options and commodities, had an incentive program under which foreign central banks could buy stock market derivatives like the Standard Poors futures contracts at a discount. According to Crudele, Japan is encouraging its private sector engage in the shadow market boosting as well you know, for the greater good. Thats called rigging the market for a higher purpose, or hoping people who can afford to invest in stocks will make lots of money and spend it. Underneath it all, the market rigging creates unfair advantage by operating under false pretenses: The bigger problem is this: If stock prices are artificially inflated, nobody can tell what a company is really worth. Recently, SHTF reported that former SEC director John Ramsay also admitted the market is rigged, stating Todays rules have been crafted to the benefit of insiders. The same article cited an author following the manipulations of Wall Street: The market is rigged against retail investors, has questioned the tactics involved in using algorithms to buy and sell shares in fractions of a second. Of course, if we listened to comedians instead of experts, we would have known that long ago. The late George Carlin said it better than anyone probably could: The game is rigged!

"McCain won't back off slam about Chrysler Ariz. Senator clarifies by saying 'any objective observer' believes automaker will not survive By David Shepardson The Detroit News Washington -- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Wednesday didn't back off his contention that Chrysler Group LLC won't survive but acknowledged that some unobjective people might not share his view. While serving as grand marshal of a NASCAR race in Arizona on Sunday, McCain said that if 'anybody believes that Chrysler is going to survive, I'd like to meet them.' McCain clarified his remarks on Wednesday, saying he meant 'any objective observer.' 'As I am sure you know, I have spent a considerable amount of time in Michigan over the years, and have seen firsthand the great work achieved by the citizens of Michigan. Their perseverance merits praise,' he said in a letter to Rep. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township. Peters, a first-term House member who represents Auburn Hills, where Chrysler's headquarters is located, sent McCain a letter Tuesday asking to meet with him and noting he believes Chrysler will survive. '[I] will meet with you at your convenience to discuss the future of Chrysler and the contribution they make to our nation's economy. Better yet, I'd be more than happy to bring you to my district to meet with thousands of Americans who are working hard every day,' Peters wrote. 'Sen. McCain's campaign slogan was 'Country First.' For some reason, that doesn't seem to extend to supporting American industries,' Peters added. 'The worst part is not just that Sen. McCain is vocally predicting failure for a great American company that supports millions of jobs across the country -- it's that you get the sense he's rooting for it.' McCain has increased his criticism of a $15 billion government bailout of Chrysler in recent months. Former President George W. Bush bailed out Chrysler with a $4 billion loan last December and the Obama administration provided additional funding to restructure the company in bankruptcy.

Adults and children â€“ many of whom contracted cholera by drinking untreated water from familiar rivers and streams â€“ lay listless in hospitals packed to capacity with emergency cases. The death toll mounted. The months passed. The cases continued. Stories of pregnant women and tough little girls and boys struggling to survive became the norm and were well recorded by partners on the ground, who were bearing witness to what is now considered the worst cholera outbreak in recent history.   Related: Hurricane Matthew: preparations and aftermath â€“ in pictures   Today, as heartbreaking reports on the death toll from hurricane Matthew appear, weâ€™re already hearing warnings about the potentially devastating aftermath: flooding and another surge in cholera cases, possibly reaching levels not seen since the earthquake. However, though six years have passed â€“ with countless lessons learned and apologies granted â€“ we stand on the precipice of repeating the same mistake when it comes to cholera: delayed use of the cholera vaccine, a lesser known tool to fight the disease. During the first outbreak in 2010, debates on whether to deplete very limited vaccine supplies â€“ and hesitation and confusion among those not affected by cholera â€“ prevented timely use. That meant the difference between life and death for too many families. Cholera can be swift and severe, capable of killing within hours. Since the 2010 outbreak, nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected and 9,000 have died. We know that increasing access to clean water and sanitation is critical in preventing the spread of the disease â€“ but, particularly when you are facing the aftermath of a natural disaster, vaccines have an essential role to play.  And the sooner the better. A few years ago, a global vaccine stockpile was established to help countries experiencing outbreaks, or at high risk of cholera, easily access vaccines. This stockpile includes two World Health Organisation-approved oral cholera vaccines, which are inexpensive, easy to deliver and effective for a minimum of five years. These vaccines have been used successfully in multiple countries.   Related: UN makes first public admission of blame for Haiti cholera outbreak   The UN â€“ which recently acknowledged its role in bringing cholera to Haiti â€“ is working on a cholera response plan in conjunction with the countryâ€™s Ministry of Health to be presented publically. But if we donâ€™t want to repeat past mistakes, we need to jump-start our cholera response today. Within two days the use of the stockpile could be approved and by next week the vaccine shipped to Haiti â€“ if we act fast the vaccine could be used in Haitiâ€™s hurricane-affected cholera hotspots in time to help prevent needless illness and death. We have an effective tool, and it is the responsibility of the global health community to do everything in our power to get cholera vaccines to Haiti immediately, so that no more families are affected by this unforgiving disease. We need to do more than plan given this current natural disaster. We must act urgently so that we do not fail Haiti again. â€¢ Dr Anita Zaidi is the director of the enteric and diarrhoeal diseases programme at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

"Oregon Deputies Shoot Familys Miniature Pony, Leave Body in Neighbors Yard and LieAmanda Warren And he didnt get too far at all. However, the Fitzgerald family was left to frantically search for him. When they started knocking on neighbors doors, they discovered with horror Girs dead body laying in the neighbors yard. Again, the family was left to seek answers. The neighbor said she had called the Sheriffs department and they came out and simply put the animal down. However, the tale the department eventually weaves is worse than the original complete lack of response Gir was found with two bullet holes through the cheek area of the head and a pool of blood behind the head where it lay. The Sheriffs department claim the family had to call them was that the pony had gotten hit on the road and had its two back legs broken. But an autopsy completely dissolves that claim. The veterinarian confirms there was absolutely nothing wrong with him. Another Clackamas County Sheriffs Office claim is that the deputy called the Oregon Humane Society and a veterinarians office first about euthanizing the horse. The Humane Society never got this mysterious call. The vet offered help but was told by the deputy that hed take care of the problem on his own and asked for the number of a rendering service. Eager much? And clearly, the pony did not have broken legs! The OHS is now investigating as an act of animal cruelty since the vets report does not reflect the inconsistent claims. For recent years, police have gotten away with killing pets by claiming to feel threatened, as if by senselessly blasting away lifeforms they could even be capable of anything resembling feeling. Now, they dont even bother with pretense. They dont bother explaining. Or, they lie and will pretend it was some kind of mercy killing for the good of society to cover for the fact that this is how some so-called men get their jollies. How do we know this? Because there is no rationale for senselessly killing someone elses precious creature. People need to know that feeling threatened does not account for police killing tiny breeds, chained or tied dogs, cats, kittens, squirrels, baby deer, docile cows, aparakeetorbeheading a pet chicken and of course, innocent people. Nor does it account for using live, injured animals for target practice. Dont believe the mercy line for deer, cows, ponies or other barnyard animals. Once dead, the animal is the owners responsibility why cant it be the owners responsibility beforehand? Sadly, the animals are killed before the owner can reach them and deputies are all too eager to say theyve killed it. Furthermore, animal control is simply a deputy and the animal will be executed on site. No other choice is always the claim regardless of the situation. Indeed, as one officer reveals, he can simply say he feels threatened if he wants to shoot something. And that is the real reason for the loss of life. A psychopathic desire to kill just because. It has nothing to do with legitimate fear or incompetence. There wasnt very much I could say at that point because they shot the pony. I mean, i didnt know how to react, Crista Fitzgerald said. Thats the kind of shock treatment that perpetuates the chance of the behavior. How can one react in such a state of shock? Maybe this doesnt seem like a big deal to a public successfully programmed through TV and movies to accept this behavior and figure to themselves that at least it wasnt a human but it is a big deal. Its a completely unnecessary loss of life with no accountability. One hopes that despite the shock-and-awe treatment this family was put through, that they continue to press the department and the media for this barbaric behavior and loss.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi returned home to San Francisco this weekend carrying a red, white and blue pocket card that will help guide her through the August recess. The card lists talking points she hopes will convince everyday Americans of the benefits they could receive under the health-care reform plan she hatched with other House Democrats last week. Pelosi distributed the cards to all 256 of her caucus members, arming the unruly Democratic majority for battle in their disparate districts across the country. After laboring for weeks in Washington to reach a compromise between liberal and conservative factions of her caucus, Pelosi is taking the fight outside the Beltway, where polls show her popularity is faltering. She plans to stump for health-care reform in San Francisco, Denver and other cities. At stake is legislation that could define her legacy as speaker and shape President Barack Obama's political future. Pelosi called health-care reform with a public insurance option 'the issue of an official lifetime. 'August will be a month of inoculation against the negative message of the insurance industry,' Pelosi said in an interview, resting in a yellow armchair in her stately office with sweeping views of the National Mall. 'It will be a month of education in terms of what is in our bill. It will be a month of communication -- listening, listening, listening to what constituents have to say.' Health care is one of the biggest tests of her nearly three-year tenure. It comes at a time when Pelosi, 69, is widely respected and even feared on Capitol Hill, but increasingly unpopular outside Washington. Her statements this spring accusing the CIA of lying to Congress, as well as repeated attacks by Republicans, have hampered her standing nationally. In June, 38 percent of Americans approved of the job she was doing as speaker and , while 45 percent disapproved, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. 'She has become a liability,' said Ken Spain, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. 'The speaker's popularity is waning, affecting her ability to legislate within her own caucus. ... The closer this debate gets to 2010, the likelier it will be that Democrats in tough districts will look to create some separation from their party leadership.' Yet along the Capitol's marble-floored corridors, hardly any Democrats speak negatively of her. Obama has praised her leadership in steering much of his agenda through Congress, including the economic stimulus and a controversial climate-change bill. In testy health-care negotiations over the past month, she has been pragmatic and unusually persistent, according to interviews with more than a dozen House Democrats. 'She's like that good coach that knows when to give the pep talk,' said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. 'And she's clearly raised kids before, because she knows how to mother us along when we're not exactly doing things the way we should.' Pelosi's caucus represents just about every political, regional and ethnic variety, and its members hold wildly divergent views on health care. She respectfully calls her caucus 'a great kaleidoscope.' Yet Pelosi, a liberal and the most powerful member of Congress, has remained unquestionably in charge. The woman who Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., once said presides over the House with an 'iron hand' refused to relent on what she considers the bottom line of any bill: a public insurance option. She sternly told lawmakers that health-care reform is 'the most important vote you will take in your careers in Congress' and that, above all else, 'we have to get this done.' Pelosi regularly kept lawmakers holed up for hours in her conference room just beside the Capitol Rotunda, sweetening the talks with pistachios and Ghirardelli chocolates (the pride of San Francisco). Other times she was less generous. During debate last week over reimbursement rates, participants said, Pelosi threatened to bolt the door and starve lawmakers until they struck a deal. The talks continued until close to midnight. Pelosi has displayed her own frustrations over the slowness of the process. She struggled with getting 'everybody singing from the same hymn book and on the same page and in tune,' said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. Some members of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition have had disagreements with Pelosi and other liberal leaders. Rep. Mike Ross, D-Ark., lead negotiator for the Blue Dogs, said it was 'a mistake' for House leaders to begin writing health-care legislation without them. But the Blue Dogs have recently been central players, winning concessions last week to allow the legislation to advance from the respective committees. Rep. Baron Hill, D-Ind., a Blue Dog, called Pelosi 'gracious,' adding: 'When things were very tense, she was a speaker of composure.' Although some liberals voiced frustration that Pelosi would compromise with moderates, most Democrats credit her with striking a deal that enables the full House to take up the legislation upon returning in September. Pelosi, a liberal, frequently bows to the desires of more moderate Democrats, whom she calls her 'majority-makers' considering the electoral wins of moderates in the Midwest and South helped Democrats win control of Congress in 2006. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said appeasing both liberal and conservative Democrats is 'the political high-wire act of the new century. 'If you step a little to the left, you fall. If you step a little to the right, you fall. You need to find that balance point in the caucus, and it's remarkable that she's found it,' he said. Pelosi has also inspired lawmakers with what some described as unusually emotional pleas in private discussions for health-care reform. In one meeting, she told fellow Democrats: 'This is our time to do something.' 'There's a power when you notice somebody really cares,' Cummings said. 'She's very sincere, and that's part of the glue.' Staff writers Lois Romano and Perry Bacon Jr. and polling analyst Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report. ",1
How US Media Is Pushing For War With SyriaYoutube ,0
"Australia: everybody must get vaccinated, except the Prime Ministers daughtersBy Jon Rappoport Were talking about Tony Abbott, who just ruled from on high that there are no more exemptions from vaccines in Australia. No more conscientious objections, no more religious exemptions. Only the rare medical exemption, permitted by a doctor. And suddenly, every family who refuses vaccinations for their children will lose up to $15,000 per year, per child, in federal support money. Every family in Australia is eligible for federal money. Tony has officially ripped away citizens right to choose. Australia is now officially a medical police state. But Back in 2006, Tony was singing a very different tune concerning his own daughters. On November 9, 2006, news.com.au had the story: Abbott rules out cancer vaccine for his daughters: FEDERAL Health Minister [at the time] Tony Abbott has said that while he may be seen as a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard, he would not be rushing to have his own daughters vaccinated [with the HPV shot] against cervical cancer. I wont be rushing out to get my daughters vaccinated, maybe thats because Im a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard but, look, I wont be, Mr Abbott said on Southern Cross radio. How interesting. How revealing. Tony Abbott, a vaccine refuser. Then. But now hes the Pope of forced vaccinations for all Australians, whether they want them or not. I dont see Australian media outlets rushing to cover this contradiction. A reader pointed me to the 2006 article. Otherwise I never would have known about Tonys double life. Back in 2006, Tony had a bizarre justification for his anti-vaccine stance. The news.com.au article spells it out: Tony: If there is a national immunisation program [that includes the HPV shot], I certainly will be making sure that they [his daughters] get vaccinated under the program. Tony: The [national] program is what the experts think clearly is absolutely necessary, and at the moment the experts dont think this [HPV shot] is absolutely necessary. The article continues: The PBAC [Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee] yesterday knocked back the application from Australian manufacturer CSL to make the Gardasil [HPV] vaccine available free to all females aged 12 to 26. Gardasil halts the spread of sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes 70 per cent of cervical cancers. At present it costs $460 for the recommended three doses. The PBAC said it made the decision because the vaccine program which would have cost about $625 million during its first four years was not value for money. Let me take this apart. Tony was saying he wouldnt have his daughters vaccinated with the HPV shot because there was no national program for it. Thats like saying, If the supermarket doesnt sell cherries, I wont let my daughters eat them. You see, the only reason a national program to vaccinate girls with the HPV shot wasnt instituted, in 2006, was because of money. The cost vs. value of the program was determined to be not worth it. Conventional researchers, doctors, and vaccine manufacturers in Australia were quite confident, in 2006, that the vaccine was safe and effective. Otherwise, they never would have considered it, in the first place, for the national vaccine program. (As far Im concerned, HPV is one of the most useless and dangerous vaccines in existence, but for the purposes of this argument, were talking about the conventional mainstream view.) Tony was deciding to reject what he considered to be a safe and effective vaccine for his own daughtersfor whatever bizarre reasons he cared to advance. Because he had the right to choose. And because he held a high post in government. And because he decided he could do whatever he wanted to do. But now, flashing forward nine years, Tony is telling every person in Australia what they have to do. No choice. No freedom. No right to seek out information independently and make a decision based on that information. Australia is a medical police state, with Tony, the old vaccine refuser, at the helm. If that isnt cause for uproar in the Land Down Under, what is? Hi, Im Tony. Im your boss, your ruler, your King. What I say goes. For you. But not necessarily for me. Thats the way it works, dont you know? The King makes rules for everyone else, but he can do what he damn well pleases. Hes above the rules. Hes different. Hes the Lord of the idiots and slaves, but he himself is free. Thats the deal. Its none of your business. Just keep your eyes straight ahead and your mouths shut and march forward. Thats your fate. I so command it.

"Time to Make Warrantless Home Video Surveillance ExtinctEFF Ricky Wahchumwah, a tribal member of the Yakima Nation, was suspected of selling bald and gold eagle feathers, as well as the feathers and pelts of other migratory birds, in violation of federal law. As part of its investigation, a undercover agent from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service went to Wahchumwahs house, pretending to be interested in buying feathers and pelts. Wahchumwah let him in his house, not knowing that the agent was secretly recording everything with a tiny video camera hidden in his clothes. The agent proceeded to capture two hours of video of Wachumwahs home, including interactions between Wachumwah and his partner and children, and was even left alone by Wachumwah for periods of time, who did not suspect he was being recorded. Charged with violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Lacey Act, Wahchumwah moved to suppress the video evidence as an unreasonable search under theFourth Amendment. The trial judge denied his motion, ruling that since Wahchumwah let the agent into his house, and the agent could testify to everything he saw in the house, Wahchumwah had no expectation of privacy. Wahchumwah appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and we filed an amicus brief supporting him. As we explain in our brief, a video camera can capture far more detail than a human eye. And unlike the human mind, a video camera doesnt forget. After all, if an officers observations were sufficient, there would be no need for the video camera in the first place. Building on the Supreme Courts landmark decision in United States v. Jones, which ruled the Fourth Amendment prohibited the warrantless use of GPS surveillance to monitor a persons car on public roads for 28 days, we make two main arguments. Second, as Justice Sotomayor said in her concurring opinion in Jones, the fact that technology allows the government to cheaply and efficiently aggregate data in ways that were impractical in the past has the potential to alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society. While it is technically possible to follow someone for 28 days continuously, it is expensive and difficult. GPS technology now allows the government to track someone wherever they go and as long as they want, all from the comforts of the police station. A video camera does the same thing. Sure, its possible for someone to enter a house and write down everything they remembered seeing hours later when they leave the house. But a video camera is capable of aggregating an enormous amount of data that would be difficult for human senses to replicate. When a video camera secretly enters the home, it can capture things like the mail on your coffee table, the books on a shelf, or the pictures on your wall. And the whole point of a camera is to record and save for another day, allowing the government to not have to rely on the human minds tendency to forget. It can rewind again and again to examine every minute detail of the house. In the past, such intensive video surveillance was reserved for serious, violent crimes. Today, its being used by Fish and Wildlife officers to investigate misdemeanors. A search warrant requirement strikes the right balance between the governments need to investigate crime, and the publics right to privacy particularly in the home, the most private of all places. Hopefully, the Ninth Circuit will reverse the trial court, and eradicate this invasive warrantless surveillance once and for all. Attached Documents linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0
"Michelle Obama Is Overwhelmed After Congress Comes CRASHING Down On Her Michelle Obama has been working hard, trying to make school food rules more strict. However, Congress has finally ruled against her. Her project is called the Hunger-Free Kids Act, and a bill is waiting to be voted on that will end it. One big part of this bill removes schools need to use whole grains and extreme limits on sodium. Currently, 80% of all grains must be whole wheat, and ever since this law took effect, students have become increasingly upset. No student wants to eat whole wheat pasta or tortillas every day, and they shouldnt be forced to. Whats even more insane is the fact that the Obama daughters attend private school, where they are fed anywhere from chicken wings to pizza. Its about time Michelles project come to an end. She doesnt have the legislative power that she thinks she does. Do you think Michelle should be thrown out of the White House? ",0
"International figures led by Barack Obama, FranÃ§ois Hollande, Bill Clinton and Prince Charles will gather in Jerusalem on Friday for the funeral of Shimon Peres, one of Israelâ€™s defining political figures and a Nobel peace prize laureate, who died on Wednesday aged 93. John Kerry, Tony Blair and the European council president, Donald Tusk, have also been invited.   Related: Shimon Peres obituary   Israeli officials briefed that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama would be attending, but the presidential contenderâ€™s campaign team appeared to deny that she would fly to Israel. The White House later confirmed Obamaâ€™s attendance. A spokesman said: â€œThe president will participate in the funeral of former Israeli president Shimon Peres. [He] will depart on 29 September and will return to Washington DC following the ceremony on 30 September.â€ The Vatican said the pope would not be going. Peres, a complex and sometimes divisive figure in Israel, will be buried on Friday at Jerusalemâ€™s Mount Herzl national cemetery after lying in state at the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, on Thursday. Peres, who served as prime minister of Israel twice and later as the countryâ€™s ninth president, died in the early hours of Wednesday at a hospital near Tel Aviv, two weeks after suffering a stroke. In more than six decades of political life, his defining achievement was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords, for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.    Peres signs the Oslo accords in a ceremony at the White House in Washington, watched by Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton and Yasser Arafat. Photograph: J David Ake/AFP/Getty Images   The peace agreements â€“ signed in Washington in 1993 and Taba, Egypt, in 1995 â€“ foresaw the creation of a Palestinian state, and were named after the Norwegian capital where the two sides had begun eight months of secret negotiations. With Peresâ€™s death the last of that trio has now gone. Rabin was cut down by a rightwing assassinâ€™s bullet in 1995 while Arafat died nine years later. Meanwhile, the prospect of a two-state solution offered by Oslo today appears further away than ever. Within hours of his death, tributes to Peres began to flow in from world leaders, including the Queen, and senior Israeli politicians. Among the latter was the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu â€“ a fierce political rival of Peres for many years â€“ who spoke of his â€œprofound sadnessâ€. In a statement from the White House, Obama described Peres as â€œthe essence of Israel itselfâ€.  â€œThere are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves,â€ Obama said.     Barack Obama, centre, with Benjamin Netanyahu, right, and Shimon Peres in 2013. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images   The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said Peres had â€œworked tirelessly for a two-state solution that would enable Israel to live securely and harmoniously with the Palestinians and the wider regionâ€. Bill Clinton, who helped usher in the Oslo peace accords when he was US president, said: â€œThe Middle East has lost a fervent advocate for peace and reconciliation.â€ The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, had sent a condolence letter to Peresâ€™s family praising him for pursuing the â€œpeace of the braveâ€.   Related: As a peacemaker, Shimon Peres never won over the Israeli public | Anshel Pfeffer   Friends and confidantes of Peres offered a mixed view of his legacy on Wednesday, not least regarding the Israel-Palestine peace process with which he was so closely associated. His friend, neighbour and biographer Michael Bar-Zohar suggested that, despite being one of its strongest proponents, Peres also recognised the failure of Oslo. â€œThe Oslo agreement was not a very big success: not its conception, not its writing, not its partner,â€ said Bar-Zohar. â€œIt was one of things he regretted most, but he still stuck to the conviction that Oslo was a great thing and that the â€˜new Middle Eastâ€™ was a new reality despite what was happening around us. â€œHe still felt the two-state solution could be implemented, although he was critical of the Israeli government about the stalemate in those negotiations and partly the Palestinians as well.â€    The Knesset in Jerusalem lowers flags to half mast on Wednesday. Photograph: Jim Hollander/EPA   The leader of Israelâ€™s opposition, Isaac Herzog, who had known Peres since childhood, first through his father, Chaim Herzog, himself a president of Israel, described a man who lived his life largely in public. â€œI think Peresâ€™s vision of a two-state solution is alive and kicking,â€ said Herzog. â€œIt has problems. Stumbling blocks. But it is still possible â€¦ I think the tragedy is both people [Palestinians and Israelis] in majorities want to move to a two-state solution. It is not moving because of politics. But his dream will be implemented.â€ Despite his role in the Oslo accords, Palestinians and the wider Arab world saw the legacy of Peres differently. Many have portrayed him as a key figure in early settlement construction and pointed to his role in the 1996 Israeli assault on Qana in Lebanon, when 106 civilians died in the shelling of a UN base where they were sheltering.   Related: What do you think Shimon Peres' legacy will be?   But for many Israelis â€“ even those on the right who opposed his support of the peace process as naive â€“ Peres will be remembered for a career that intimately tracked the countryâ€™s short history. Often a deeply divisive figure in Israeli politics â€“ he was hated on the right for his advocacy of Oslo â€“ Peres later became one of Israelâ€™s most popular public figures during his seven-year term as president from 2007-14. As recently as last year, Peres strongly criticised the direction of the rightwing government of Netanyahu, although he did not name the prime minister directly. â€œIsrael should implement the two-state solution for her own sake, because if we should lose our majority, and today we are almost equal, we cannot remain a Jewish state or a democratic state. Thatâ€™s the main issue, and to my regret they [the government] do the opposite.â€ Born in Wiszniewo, then in Poland and now in Belarus, Peres emigrated to British Mandate Palestine in 1934 at the age of 11, and was a founder of the Labour-Zionist Youth Movement and a member of the Haganah Jewish paramilitary forces before Israel declared independence.    Peres posing for a portrait at the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa. Photograph: Oded Balilty/AP   As a defence official in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Peres was involved in the establishment in Dimona of Israelâ€™s nuclear reactor, the facility at the centre of Israelâ€™s nuclear weapons programme. During a decades-long career, he occupied almost every significant position in Israeli political life. His first role was as director-general of Israelâ€™s ministry of defence in his 20s, as a protege of David Ben-Gurion, involved in the secret planning of the Suez offensive with Britain and France in alliance against Gamal Abdel Nasserâ€™s Egypt. First elected to the Knesset in 1959, his cabinet roles included the defence, finance and foreign affairs portfolios before he served two brief periods as prime minister. Although he ran for prime minister five times between 1977 and 1996, he never won a national election outright.",1
"Calling it his lifelong dream, local man Brendan Lockhart, an insecure and perpetually frustrated bully who believes he has something to prove to the world, told reporters Thursday that he is seriously considering a career in law enforcement. Lockhart, a recent high-school graduate who sources confirmed is plagued by resentment, self-doubt, unexpected fits of rage, and has always had a penchant for tormenting those who are smaller and weaker than him, explained that he feels he is well suited to serve as a police officer. Ive always wanted to be a cop, said Lockhart, whose paranoia and inferiority complex constantly haunt him, leading him to lash out at others in order to convince them he is in control. I know its a tough line of work, but I think Ive got what it takes to earn my shield and get out there and keep the peace. This is the job I was born to do, continued the man whose main goal in life is to prove to others that he is strong, confident, and not afraid. Friends and family confirmed that Lockhart, an unpredictable, petty individual who frequently loses his temper when he feels he is being threatened or disrespected, has in recent months been inquiring into joining the ranks of the Raleigh Police Department. In this role, the man with a massive chip on his shoulder and no visible sense of empathy would be tasked with peacefully resolving disputes and evenhandedly administering justice to members of the community over whom he would have official power. Specifically, sources speculated that should Lockhart successfully complete the 17-week officer training program and cursory psychological examination necessary to become a cop, the 18-year-old, who suffers from feelings of inadequacy and frequently explodes in emotional outbursts against people he perceives to be mocking him, would on a daily basis be placed in delicate situations requiring extreme patience and sound judgment. My dads encouraging me to go to the academy, and he says that once I graduate I can probably get a job around here, said Lockhart, referring to the man whose own lack of compassion and propensity for inexplicable violence is largely to blame for similar patterns in his son, and who is himself a veteran police officer. Once Im a cop, Im going to do what I have to do to make sure these neighborhoods stay safe. I bet a lot of people dont think I can do it, but Ill show them, continued the man who could in six months time possess both a standard-issue firearm and the city-sanctioned authority to unholster and fire the weapon. When pressed for further comment, sources close to the man who hopes to play an active role in protecting his community confirmed that Lockhart constantly goes out of his way to intimidate and belittle those people he knows are too submissive to fight back. The 18-year-old often fantasizes at length about getting revenge on those he believes have wronged him. When frustrated or enraged with his own general powerlessness in the world, he reportedly has a tendency to take out these emotions on the first person he comes across, with little or no provocation. Lockhart routinely gets in screaming arguments with others and must be physically restrained as his anger reaches a white-hot pitch, frightening all around him. A devoted fan of mixed martial arts, Lockhart is capable of watching YouTube videos of people being pummeled senselessly for hours at a time. Sources also felt it bears mentioning that Lockhart is an impassioned and unapologetic racist. When asked to outline his motivations for entering the field of law enforcement, the perpetually infuriated bully who could very soon be responsible for the security and well-being of thousands of innocent people explained that he feels a personal obligation to do whatever necessary to safeguard society. Theres a lot of bad people out there who think they can get away with doing whatever they want, and someone has to stop them, said Lockhart, his hands unconsciously closing into tight fists. So if I dont step up and show everyone whos boss, who will? Plus, Ive been talking to my buddies at the gym, and a bunch of them are gonna be cops too, Lockhart continued. Itll be great. ",0
"CIA Director Discusses Geoengineering at CFR EventBy Brandon Turbeville The discussion was designed to address threats to national and global security as well as world stability. Among the threats that Brennan discusses are of course the usual suspects like ISIS and biological warfare, but interestingly enough, Brennan focused heavily on the rapid change and development of technology. First mentioning the potential for cyber attacks, hacking, and other types of disruptions to the governmental, military and civilian infrastructure of the world, Brennan also mentioned the problem of an aging population due to increased longevity as well as the potential for the creation of genetically engineered bacteria to be used for biological warfare purposes. But what has raised many eyebrows is Brennans discussion of geoengineering. While Brennan did not state that geoengineering was currently being conducted, he did go into some discussion about the possibility of geoengineering in the near future. Brennan stated, Another example is the array of technologiesoften referred to collectively as geoengineeringthat potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the suns heat, in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community. On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. On the geopolitical side, the technologys potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions at the expense of others could trigger sharp opposition by some nations. Others might seize on SAIs benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions. And, as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of SAI. While we must be clear that Brennan did not state that geoengineering was currently taking place or that he made mention of chemtrails, it is important to note that he essentially described the process of chemtrailing and geoengineering in a speech that was designed to discuss possible threats to global security in the near future. His speech was given to the Council on Foreign Relations, no less, one cell in a worldwide network of think tanks who are responsible for developing and implementing much of the Anglo-American agenda through national policy. While many may consider geoengineering to be nothing more than a conspiracy theory, Brennans speech should cause them to rethink their perspective.

I call bulls***t. CO2 warming is a farce. The Earth is going to cool naturally. However, placing the geoengineering card in the deck will keep the scam alive for a long time as the Earth cools naturally. CO2 warming is logarithmic, and adding extra CO2 at this point is like putting on more sunscreen to block the 0.1% of UV that was not blocked by the first layer of sunscreen. BTW, I know CO2 blocks IR radiation, Im just using an example of sunscreen blocking UV. Trump U graduate? Hildebeast fan? If one shall believe wiki in this case: The principal components of volcanic gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur either as sulfur dioxide (SO2) (high-temperature volcanic gases) or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (low-temperature volcanic gases), nitrogen, argon, helium, neon, methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. What we have in the atmosphere RIGHT NOW, from the YEARS LONG GEOENGINEERING OF OUR PLANET, are METAL PARTICLES, which have NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT false explanation of CO2 mitigation effort I can tell you , here in Colorado, The wind seems to come up from the south and blow the clouds north east. This is not normal. Normal winds come over the mountains and blow easterly. The biggest threats to national and global security are Henry Kissinger, John Brennan, James Comey, the CFR, IMF, World Bank, Lloyd Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, etc. ",0
"Newly elected Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (DCA) accused her fellow House Democrats of 'just mouthing support' for a bill she introduced that is expected to pass overwhelmingly when the incoming 110th Congress convenes next year. <h3>Speaking Her Mind</h3><p>'It's obvious you don't really want to, and you're only doing it because you think that's what I want.'</p><p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi</p> 'You shouldn't just pass it because I want it, but because you want it, too,' said Pelosi of the bill, which would reduce interest rates on federally funded college loans. 'I'm really disappointed you're not as excited as I am about this bill. It says a lot. It really says a lot.' Rep. Jerry Costello (DIL), a vocal advocate of the bill, expressed confusion over Pelosi's reaction to his support. 'I don't understand what Speaker Pelosi expects from us, though I don't dare say that to her,' Costello said. 'I've been trying to be extra nice to her lately after she told me that my voting record on Medicare and prescription-drug issues has been 'distant' lately. 'Distant?' What does that even mean?' Pelosi said that her doubts about the reception toward her bill stem from a general fear that Capitol Hill politicians were 'only going through the motions lately' and 'merely placating me to keep me quiet.' She also expressed concern that her relationship to the House was based completely on voting. 'I want to be part of a Congress that doesn't pass legislation just to pass it, but because it really, truly believes in it,' Pelosi said. 'I don't care if we don't get a single bill out of committee the whole time I'm Speakerjust as long as we're open and honest about where we're at.' 'I'm a pretty good judge of congressional character, you know,' Pelosi added. 'I can tell when a legislative body is hiding something.' Signs of Pelosi's second-guessing began to show in September, after she first proposed the bill on the House floor. When Rep. Edward Markey (DMA) called the bill a 'good, common-sense measure,' Pelosi requested additional floor time to start her address over from the beginning, on the grounds that 'the members present had obviously not paid attention to a single word.' While delivering the address a second time, she paused midway to request that Rep. Bill Shuster (RPA) repeat what she just said. 'I remember once on the phone, when she called me trying to gather support for the bill, she got mad when I said, 'Sure, I'll vote for it,'' Rep. Chris Van Hollen (DMD) said. 'She said, 'That's all you can say, 'Sure?' When you know how important this is to me?' I told her I was on board with whatever she wanted and then she just made this exasperated groan and hung up.' 'At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if we never saw this bill again,' Van Hollen added. Not content with the status quo, Pelosi told her fellow Democrats that 'there's going to be a lot of changes in the way we communicate' after the Congressional recess. According to Pelosi, deliberations on the House floor will be based on 'total candor' about 'what Congress is really feeling about individual pieces of legislation, the motives behind the voting, and the tone of the discussion.' If she feels the talks have failed, Pelosi plans to alert the 434 other representatives of her displeasure by doing nothing for several weeks and then bursting into tears in the middle of House debates on agricultural subsidies. 'Sometimes I wish I'd never gotten involved with a Congress like this at all,' Pelosi said. 'It's not just this one bill, it's their whole attitude about everything. I can't help but think that I'd be better off all alone in this hallowed chamber.' While House Democrats said they look forward to working with the first female House Speaker, in private they expressed reservations about whether she will be able to make the transition to the new position. Several representatives cited an outburst on the House floor in October during which Pelosi told the governing body that if they didn't know what was on the weekly legislative agenda, then she certainly wasn't going to tell them.

"BREAKING: Trump Drops Bombshell, Shocks Supporters Everywhere As Donald Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway played an important role in securing his victory over Hillary Clinton. Now, it appears Trump is prepared to reward her dedication in a major way. In an interview on Fox News, Conway revealed that she has been offered a big position in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, host Sean Hannity asked Conway to comment on Gov. Mitt Romneys involvement in the cabinet and asked whether she would be playing a role in the White House. Can you comment on both of those things? Hannity asked. Because a lot of people think you deserve a big position, like me. Well, thank you, thats very kind, Conway replied. Ive been offered a big position. But Sean, the fact is that Im here to support the President-elect and the vice President-elect, both men whom I know and admire greatly, however they need me right now in the transition. I told them as recently as an hour ago, Dont worry about me, all of that will come together. Conway joined the Trump campaign in August, and became the first woman to lead a successful U.S. presidential campaign. Many believe she is a strong candidate for the position of White House press secretary. But in terms of Governor Romney, I think the secretary of state position is such that, and all the Cabinet positions, you have to be qualified and capable, number one, Conway commented. Number two, you have to be loyal to what President-elect Trump has said his vision of the world and his agenda is for the first 100 days or so. Hannity then reminded Conway of Romneys past words about Trump during the campaign, when he called Trump a huckster. I mean, remember that speech he gave, it was horrible, just awful, Hannity commented. Well, I just want to say generally, apart from Governor Romney, that there were a lot of NeverTrumpers who were Never Trump up until the last moment, Conway replied. Go read their Twitter feeds. Go pull the tape of what they were saying on TV cameras and in print in different places. She continued, They didnt think he would win and they wanted to pile on. Instead of helping the nominee of their party they piled on. And in terms of a diverse Cabinet, Im all for diversity but I think maybe one NeverTrumper is enough, so lets not get two, three, five in there. That would be my polite suggestion. Conway went on to confirm that there are a number of candidates in line for the position Romney is being considered for. She also discussed redefining the role of Secretary of State after Clinton and Kerry. You dont need to go fly around the world to be an effective Secretary of State. Kissinger and Schultz, they stuck closer to home serving the president, Conway added. That would be my model. What do you think? Should Conway play a role in the Trump Administration? ",0

"Wall Street celebrated by pushing stocks and commodities higher. The Dow Jones industrial average surged above 9,500 Friday for the first time since November and oil futures flirted with $75 a barrel before closing at $73.89, the highest settlement price of 2009. The Dow rose $155.91, or 1.7 percent, to 9,505.96, and the other big indexes gained more than 1.5 percent. But the rally-sparking reassurance disguises the reality that many of the nation's most populous regions -- areas such as California and Florida -- long accustomed to serving as dynamos of recovery and growth might not see much cause for rejoicing any time soon. That's because the recession's grip has been so varied from one region to another that recovery probably will be uneven, economists say, and because factors that helped make some areas powerhouses -- such as in-migration from other states -- might not work for them this time. Apart from Texas, the nation's southern economic heavyweights were among the hardest hit during the downturn, and the negative effects might last for years. Trouble figures to persist in the nation's industrial midsection as well. In the good news column, the National Association of Realtors said Friday that sales of existing homes rose 7.2 percent in July, the largest monthly gain since record-keeping began in 1999 and higher than analysts had expected. But in the West, housing resale activity fell 1.7 percent over the month. Striking a sour note, data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed that unemployment climbed higher into double digits in California during July, while Florida's jobless rate stood at 10.7 percent last month -- and the June rate was revised upward to the same level. During July, California shed another 35,800 jobs and Florida more than 25,000; combined, the two states have lost one-fifth of the 5.7 million jobs cut nationwide in the past 12 months. Michigan, Illinois and Ohio have been pounded as well, largely because of auto and other manufacturing woes. Collectively, the three states have lost more than 830,000 jobs in the past year, and their unemployment rates were well above the national average of 9.4 percent in July. Although deep recessions typically have been followed by robust recoveries, many more of the manufacturing jobs lost in this recession are thought to be permanent. And concerns about sluggish spending by debt-ridden consumers are weighing down growth forecasts. David Huether, chief economist at the National Manufacturers Association, says he's expecting only half of the nearly 2 million factory jobs lost to come back. 'There's going to be stagnation going on,' he said. America's breadbasket, by contrast, has weathered the economic storm, thanks to its reliance on energy and commodities -- making it a potential leader in a recovery. Texas, by some measures, entered the recession only in the first quarter of 2009, more than a year after the nation, and it added nearly 38,000 jobs in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, third after New York and Michigan. Bernanke suggested the economy seemed to be stabilizing, but he saw no quick recovery. Speaking at the annual Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Bernanke said that economic activity 'appears to be leveling out in the United States and abroad.' Although prospects for growth 'appear good' in the near term, he said, a recovery probably would be 'relatively slow at first, with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels.' The emerging recovery also could be different in another big way: Past economic expansions have favored the South and West, says Chad Wilkerson, a Fed economist in Oklahoma City who studied the nation's eight prior economic cycles from 1957 to 2003. Part of that trend was driven by heavy migration to the Sun Belt, which fueled demand for housing and services. But the real-estate plunge in Florida, Georgia and the Southwest has wreaked havoc. And losses in wages, housing wealth and retirement plans have curtailed people's migration plans. Older people from New York and New Jersey, in particular, once flocked to Florida every year. Not so much anymore. Florida's population is shrinking for the first time since the 1940s. 'Baby boomers are in between now. Even ones who could potentially retire are wary now,' said William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. For the Sunbelt, he said, there won't be a quick rebound: 'In turning off the spigot of migration, you have a different model.' Migration patterns have turned more favorable in sparsely populated parts of America's midsection, where unemployment was running as low as 4.2 percent in South Dakota and 6.5 percent or less in Iowa, Nebraska and Oklahoma. These and other states have been supported by demand for commodities, whether natural gas or corn, but they also avoided the housing bust. 'Nobody really went on a binge and so nobody went broke,' said John Schwietz of Omaha, who found a job recently as manager of international credit at Valmont Industries, a maker of farm equipment and other products. But Nebraska and other states like it are too small to drive growth nationally, and commodity prices are notoriously susceptible to wild fluctuations. It's hard to tell which areas and industries will lead a recovery, said Jonas Prising, president of the North American operations of Manpower, a labor supply company. 'During other recessions, employers hired in anticipation of a recovery,' he said. 'This time, they will hire when they see it.' Staff writer Peter Hong contributed to this report. ",1
"An attack on aid workers in South Sudan that left one person dead and in which NGO staff were assaulted and raped has brought calls for radical reform, amid concerns that agencies are not doing enough to protect their staff.   Experts say the attack highlights far more widespread failings within the humanitarian industry, with some warning that not enough has been done to make humanitarian staff safe in South Sudan since the attack. In early July, the South Sudan capital Juba was the scene of three days of heavy fighting between government forces loyal to Salva Kiir and supporters of Riek Machar, the former vice-president turned rebel leader. Aid workers and NGO staff living at a compound near the city were in â€œlock downâ€ mode behind barbed wire fences and locked gates.  On 11 July between 80 and 100 soldiers shot their way into the compound. US contractor Jesse Bunch, who was shot and beaten in the attack, said the US embassy failed to let staff know how bad the violence was: â€œIf somebody had told me how badly it was going on Wednesday [6 July] I would have been out of there.â€  Several of the aid workers were raped, others were badly beaten, and some terrorised with mock executions. Local journalist John Gatluak was executed by the troops during the attack, which lasted almost four hours.   Related: An eye for an eye is the wrong response to attacks on humanitarians   The UN peacekeeping force stationed less than a mile away failed to respond to desperate calls for help. Neither did embassies, including the US embassy. There has been significant discussion about this in the months since.  But individuals who knew Terrain - the compound where aid workers were living - say that the NGO escape plans had never relied on the UN coming to the rescue. According to John (not his real name) a security expert who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, the plan was to seek shelter at the UN compound: â€œWe had an exit strategy that you would go over the back fence and get to the UN by throwing blankets over the wire but ... during the attack there were troops everywhere.â€ Now humanitarian experts say better communication and better risk management from the UN and from their own agencies and governments could have helped staff escape before the conflict escalated. They are concerned that not enough is being done to improve security even now.  Bunch, who was working as a private contractor for aid agency Management Systems International, says the US embassy failed to keep aid workers informed. â€œThe problem is that the UN mandate is completely under resourced for what it is being asked to do,â€ he said. â€œIt would have been nice if they had rescued us â€“ but we didnâ€™t really expect it.   There were systemic failures and also incredible naivety. Itâ€™s an information failure  Jesse Bunch       â€œThere were systemic failures and also incredible naivety. Itâ€™s an information failure. At the UN and the US nobody has to warn the international community.  â€œThe incredible naivety on the part of the humanitarian community is that they have this idea that because they are doing humanitarian work they will be safe, but that has been proven again and again not to be true.â€ However, in response to claims that they had not shared critical information, a US State Department official told the Guardian that several messages had been passed to US citizens in South Sudan in the days leading up to the attack. â€œThe Department has no higher priority than the protection of US citizens overseasâ€Ž. On July 8th, 10th and 11th the United States issued emergency and security messages for US citizens ... warning them of the deteriorating security situation in and around Juba. USAid ... was in frequent communication with its implementing partners on their status and location. Additionally [we] released a travel warning advising against travel to South Sudan and ... noted the ordered departure of non-emergency personnel from the Juba embassy. â€œAs we stated directly after the Terrain camp attack,â€Ž the United States condemns these horrific attacks and have consistently called for an end to attacks on civilians, UN peacekeepers, and humanitarian workers. We have pressed for the government to hold those responsible for this violence and other violence in early July that killed hundreds and displaced thousands.â€   People had a false sense of protection ... The Terrain attack bust that myth  Anonymous aid worker     Bunch is worried that without significant changes to security, aid workers could be attacked again. â€œItâ€™s two months after the attack and the security has not changed. That is a serious, serious thing. Iâ€™m in touch with people there, people are aware of these [security] problems but they are committed to what they do. They are naive and the organisations involved are naive. Anyone could carry out an attack.â€ Another aid worker agreed that that despite the shock of the attack she had seen little change in the security measures of her organisation. Speaking to the Guardian anonymously, she said: â€œThe Terrain attack, it had a huge reverberation. People had a false sense of protection ... The attack bust that myth. We have staff in Juba and that attack triggered a lot of internal discussion. It was seen as a watershed moment but as yet we havenâ€™t changed the compound our staff are living in. I donâ€™t believe we have taken any additional security steps.â€ John, who was working in Juba earlier this year and knew the Terrain compound well, argues that security was taken very seriously by his own organisation but that plans could not withstand the increase in violence from armed groups. â€œHindsight is a wonderful thing. Security is never perfect and is always low down on the food chain in terms of financing and budgeting but [my organisation] had actually invested heavily in security. I was well paid, we had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on hostile environment training and over $40,000 on physical measures. Terrain had CCTV, multiple gates. The safe room held for hours. Normally you would expect 15 to 20 minutes until the cavalry arrived.   Related: How should the media report rape and sexual violence?   â€œWe know the army and police are involved in criminality but you donâ€™t plan for 100 armed men coming into your compound. You are always working against probability, you canâ€™t plan for every eventuality.â€    Should NGOs consider pulling out? Bunch believes that â€œpeople should withdraw temporarily. Donors including the US should set minimal operating standards and we should negotiate with the South Sudan government that if [they] want aid to come in then we need heavy infrastructure.â€ But Deepmala Mahla, South Sudan country director at Mercy Corps, said she hoped that humanitarians would not consider leaving. â€œI would be very worried and disheartened [if it was considered]. South Sudan is in need of assistance now more than ever. We are committed to South Sudanese men, women and children and for Mercy Corps South Sudan is a priority country, and our humanitarian spirit will be pained if essential aid is suspended or withdrawn for people in urgent need.â€ But all are clear that the wider exposure to risk needs to be looked at carefully. â€œThere is a widespread failure to protect staff,â€ says Adam Childs, an expert in NGO risk. â€œI ask people in the field â€˜What is the basis for your safety if you donâ€™t use guns?â€™ They say â€˜Well, they donâ€™t want to hurt us.â€™ [So] I ask how are you measuring that acceptance? Do you do any data collection on your basic security? The answer is no. But, do you count paperclips? Oh yes, they got that.â€ The Terrain incident raises the issue of attacks on humanitarians. â€œIt is imperative that humanitarian organisations are granted free, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, to reach all people in need, wherever they are,â€ said United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen Oâ€™Brien after the attack in South Sudan.  Safety for aid workers has become an increasingly serious issue for the industry. Last year, in a landmark case a court found the Norwegian Refugee Council guilty of gross negligence in a case brought by one of its former staff members Steve Dennis. The indiscriminate targetting of humanitarians and medics in Syria and Yemen has also raised concerns.

"Low paid workers have been handed their biggest pay rise since the 1990s, after the introduction of the â€œnational living wageâ€ forced companies to pay workers aged 25 and over a minimum Â£7.20 an hour. The bottom 10% of earners received a 4.4% increase in the year to April, while the boost for the bottom 5% of earners was even bigger at 6.2%, according to official data. Low pay campaigners cheered the figures which also showed that the significant rise in low pay was most prominent among women and part-time workers, helping to close the gender pay gap at the bottom end of the pay scale. The Resolution Foundation said the national living wage (NLW) had â€œwell and truly made its mark on pay across Britainâ€ and â€œcontributed to a significant closing of the gender pay gap and a welcome fall in pay inequalityâ€. The thinktank said 2016 was the strongest year for pay in over five years but warned it may prove to be a high-water mark after recent rises in inflation and stagnant growth in average pay levels. â€œWe may not see this level of growth again this parliament given the outlook for lower earnings growth and higher inflation in the wake of the Brexit vote,â€ it said. The jump in pay for earners affected by the national living wage helped push Britonsâ€™ weekly earnings, once inflation is taken into account, up by 1.9% last year. Gross average earnings rose by 2.2% to Â£539 a week, from Â£527 in 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said the increase was due to a combination of earnings growth â€“ boosted by the NLW â€“ and a low level of inflation at that time. It also reflects rises in the national minimum wage for younger workers from last October.  Weekly earnings  The CBI business lobby group said the data confirmed a â€œpicture of low but robust wage growth across the UK economy before the EU referendumâ€. Its director of people and skills, Neil Carberry, said: â€œItâ€™s clear that the introduction of the national living wage has supported lower earnersâ€™ incomes, building on several years of higher-than-average increases in the old national minimum wage.â€ He said the ONS figures showed a higher level of â€œnon-complianceâ€ than seen previously but said this was likely to be due to the survey being completed in the month that the national living wage was introduced. The TUC said it was concerned that 362,000 people were paid below the minimum wage in the year to April â€“ a 73% increase from the previous year. The ONS said the figure was not comparable with 2015 and also noted that there were legal exemptions, such as for employees who get accommodation as part of their pay package, which can be offset against their pay rate. The TUCâ€™s general secretary, Frances Oâ€™Grady, also said it was disappointing that the average gender pay gap was closing at a â€œsnailâ€™s paceâ€, as the pay gap between full-time male and female employees fell to 9.4% from 9.6% in 2015. This is the lowest since the survey began in 1997, although the gap has changed relatively little over the past six years, the ONS noted.  Gender pay gap graphic  Oâ€™Grady, said: â€œWe need a labour market that works better for women. This means helping mums get back into well-paid jobs after they have kids. And encouraging dads to take on more caring responsibilities. The government should also scrap tribunal fees, which stop women getting justice from bad employers who have discriminated against them.â€ People working full-time in the private sector earned Â£517 a week on average, up 3.4%, while those in the public sector were paid Â£594, up 0.7% on the previous year. Men working full-time in April earned an average of Â£578 per week, up 1.9% on the previous year, while women were paid Â£480, up 2.2%. The gap between men and womenâ€™s pay has remained relatively consistent from 1997 to 2016, at about Â£100, the ONS said. At a regional level, London came top, at Â£671 per week for full-time workers. This compares with a UK average of Â£539 per week.  regional  In percentage growth, the regions with the biggest earnings growth in the past year were the West Midlands (up 3.7%), the north-west (up 3%) and Wales (up 2.9%), while those with the slowest growth were the north-east (up 0.7%), the East Midlands (up 0.9%) and Scotland (up 1.5%). The business minister, Margot James, said: â€œThe government is determined to build an economy that works for all and itâ€™s encouraging that earnings have grown over the last year, with the national living wage driving up the wages of the lowest paid.â€ James said she was pleased the gender pay gap was closing but admitted there was â€œstill more to be done to make sure women are treated equallyâ€.",1

"In unusually candid remarks, President Obama privately told a group of Democratic donors last Friday that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was nearing the point at which his campaign against Hillary Clinton would end, and that the party must soon come together to back her.Mr. Obama acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was perceived to have weaknesses as a candidate, and that some Democrats did not view her as authentic.But he played down the importance of authenticity, noting that President George W. Bush â€” whose record he ran aggressively against in 2008 â€” was once praised for his authenticity.Mr. Obama made the remarks after reporters had left a fund-raising event in Austin, Tex., for the Democratic National Committee. The comments were described by three people in the room for the event, all of whom were granted anonymity to describe a candid moment with the president. The comments were later confirmed by a White House official.Mr. Obama chose his words carefully, and did not explicitly call on Mr. Sanders to quit the race, according to those in the room. Still, those in attendance said in interviews that they took his comments as a signal to Mr. Sanders that perpetuating his campaign, which is now an uphill climb, could only help the Republicans recapture the White House.Mr. Obamaâ€™s message came at a critical juncture for Mr. Sanders, who had just upset Mrs. Clinton in the Michigan primary and has been trying to convince Democrats that his campaign is not over, despite Mrs. Clintonâ€™s formidable lead in delegates.Mr. Obama has been careful in public to avoid disparaging Mr. Sanders, given his deeper history and relationship with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama also does not want to alienate the liberal voters who have flocked to Mr. Sanders.Mr. Obama acknowledged what have emerged as the central complaints about Mrs. Clinton among Democratic activists: that she is not generating enough excitement in her campaign, and lacks the â€œauthenticityâ€ of Mr. Sanders.Those in attendance described an urgency in Mr. Obamaâ€™s tone as he suggested that Democrats needed to come together to prevent an opening for the Republicans, whose leading candidate is Donald J. Trump, to exploit.Mr. Obama addressed the group four nights before Tuesdayâ€™s nominating contests, in which Mrs. Clinton was heavily favored. As it happened, Mrs. Clinton won at least four of the five states that voted â€” Missouri has yet to be called â€” further padding her delegates lead.Mr. Obama indicated that he knew some people were not â€œexcitedâ€ by Mrs. Clintonâ€™s candidacy, a White House official confirmed.But, while he stressed that he was not endorsing either candidate, and that both would make good presidents, Mr. Obama went on to lavish praise on Mrs. Clinton, describing her as smart, tough and experienced, and said that she would continue the work of his administration. Mr. Sanders has publicly criticized Mr. Obama on certain policies and has called for a â€œpolitical revolution.â€Mr. Obama said that he understood the appeal to voters of a candidate who is authentic, the official said. But he also reminded the Texas donors in the room that Mr. Bush was considered authentic when he was running for president, suggesting that being authentic did not necessarily translate into being a good president, in his view.Mr. Trumpâ€™s admirers have often praised him for his authenticity and blunt style, contrasting it with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s more cautious approach.The Austin event was hosted by Kirk Rudy, a real estate executive, and raised money for the Democratic National Committee. Attendees paid as much as $33,400 a ticket.Mr. Sanders is trying to reassure supporters and the public that he is still in pursuit of the presidency despite the long odds against him. Some of his supporters have complained that the Democratic National Committee has favored Mrs. Clinton in the primary battle.Mr. Sandersâ€™s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, and his senior campaign adviser, Tad Devine, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that they believed that the senator could still make up Mrs. Clintonâ€™s delegate lead. They added that Mr. Sanders expected to do very well in coming contests in Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, Utah, Washington and New York.â€œWe are literally about halfway through,â€ Mr. Weaver said.Mr. Devine echoed those sentiments. â€œWe agree we are behind, but we also think we are going to win this game,â€ he said. â€œWe are just not intimidated by the numbers.â€Both men also said that it would be unfair to not allow voters in all states to be able to cast their ballots for Mr. Sanders and that he had the money to continue his campaign through the Democratic convention this summer.",1
"BREAKING: George Bush SR. Moved To Intensive Care... Please Send Your Prayers According to shocking new reports, both President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush are now in a Houston hospital and will not attend Donald Trumps inauguration. According to a statement from his office, the 92-year-old former president was moved to intensive care on Wednesday after being admitted on Saturday. Shortly after our previous report on President Bushs condition, he was admitted to the ICU at Houston Methodist Hospital to address an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia, the statement read. Doctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation. President Bush is stable and resting comfortably in the ICU, where he will remain for observation. 91-year-old Barbara Bush was also admitted on Wednesday as a precaution after she experienced fatigue and coughing. Previously, the 41st president sent a letter to Trump expressing his regrets that he could not attend Fridays ceremony, saying both he and the former first lady would be with you and the country in spirit. The letter was sent before he was hospitalized for breathing problems. I want you to know that I wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country, Bush senior wrote on January 10. If I can ever be of help, please let me know. Will you pray for George and Barbara Bush? Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com ",0
"Globalists Blame Financial Crisis of 2008 to Usher in One World CurrencySusanne Posel, Contributor The Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) has announced that they will stop printing pennies. The RCM have unveiled a digital RFID-chip based currency that can be loaded up, stored and spent in-store and online. The RCM calls this currency MintChip; which will be a virtual payment method accessible through microchips, microSD cards and USB sticks. This RFID-chip currency is collaboration with the US corporations and research and development outfits. Ian Bennett, president and CEO of the Mint explains: As part of its research and development efforts, the Mint has developed MintChip, which could be characterized as an evolution of physical money, with the added benefits of being electronic. The MintChip is still under development, with patents pending and prototypes being studied. The creation and perfection of the technology must be useable with American markets. Ah, the dream: one world, one economy, one currency and, of course, one global political system . . . a common currency means a common economic policy . . . The United Future World Currencyis a foundation nearly 2 decades old that seeks to bring to life the project for a common currency once defined as the Euro. They are committed to bringing awareness to the necessity of global currency. The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a group of technocrats that represent 420 banking cartels and financing houses have joined the cry for a one world currency. Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF, said: A core group of the worlds leading economies need to come together and hammer out anunderstanding. The narrowly focused unilateral and bilateral policy actions seen in recent months including many proposed and actual measures on trade, currency intervention and monetary policy have contributed to worsening underlying macroeconomic imbalances. They have also led to growing protectionist pressures as countries scramble for export markets as a source of growth. The UNs call for one world currency is contained in their report entitled, United Nations: Economic and Social Survey 2010. The UN asserted that the US dollar must be replaced by a new one-world currency issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In response to the Global Market Crash of 2008, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the Peoples Bank of China, revived the ideal of the Bancor by demanding that the IMF have special drawing rights (SDRs). The UN published a report following the financial crisis in 2008 entitled, The Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System wherein they created a commission to restore global economic stability. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon affirmed that a one-world currency would bridge the old North-South divide and that the UNs monetary vision if properly implemented would be a path out of our current predicament. In a reportpublished in 2010, the IMF stated that the Bancor should be established and administered as the one-world currency. To go along with the one-world currency, the IMF advises the establishment of a one-world bank; which would also have issuance rights as the Federal Reserve Bank does within the US. The IMF report states: The global central bank could serve as a lender of last resort, providing neededsystemic liquidity in the event of adverse shocks and more automatically than at present. Such liquidity was provided in the most recent crisis mainly by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which however may not always provide such liquidity. The advent of a global currency, if allowed to happen will be controlled by the UN, as the IMF is an arm of the globalist Elite front. Simply put, this demand is a call for economic control by the international community for the express purpose of ensuring that the future of all sovereign nations eventually fall victim to the coming global governance. linkwithin_text=Related Articles: ",0
"Temperamental teenage star Mario Balotelli will not be staying at Inter Milan next year unless his situation improves, his agent has said. The 19-year-old has had a tempestuous campaign having fallen out first with coach Jose Mourinho and then lately with the club's fans. He has also found himself increasingly confined to the bench since the January arrival of Macedonia's Goran Pandev. And his agent Mino Raiola has put potential suitors such as Arsenal and Manchester City on the alert by claiming his charge could well be on his way out. 'It's sure that like this he can't go on, Mario won't be staying another year at Inter like this, I can guarantee that,' he said. 'Over the last eight to nine months no-one in the club has been protecting Mario. I'm accused of acting like his press officer and it's true given that the Inter press officer has only one client: Mourinho. 'Mario is not perfect, just like Mourinho is not horrible, but Mourinho needs a common enemy for himself and the team and Balotelli fell into the trap. 'Sometimes in training he's even scared. Mario made his apologies but I haven't heard those of the team-mates who attacked him in the changing rooms, nor has the club acted on that. 'Mario was sure that this would be his year, that he'd be first choice for club and country. 'He didn't achieve his objectives and reacted with a tension from which he has not managed to escape.' Balotelli first broke into the first team picture two years ago under Roberto Mancini, now at Manchester City, but has not managed to earn more than a bit- part role under Mourinho. The Portuguese coach has often criticised the Italian of Ghanaian descent for his attitude in both training and matches and his lack of effort. But the last straw came at the end of the Champions League semi-final first leg -- a 3-1 victory against Barcelona -- when after being jeered by fans for his listless 20-minute cameo, Balotelli flung his shirt to the ground. That angered fans and players alike with World Cup winning centre-back Marco Materazzi allegedly getting physical with the youngster in the changing rooms while some fans tried to attack him as he left. But Raiola seems to lay most of the blame at the feet of Mourinho. 'Balotelli is expecting to play with Inter until the end of the season with the hope of playing in the Champions League final,' he added. 'But Mourinho has taught him that percentages count for little, that 99.9 percent is worth zero. 'Balotelli wants to play in sacred peace, to have a bit of joy at the end of the season because he's not had much throughout it. He's suffered terribly, with a lot of stress. 'Mario doesn't have a problem either with the fans or the team but it's clear that the problems with the club have not been solved. 'I don't know if they can be solved. Balotelli has asked for forgiveness but someone in the club has purposefully not understood.' ",1
"When the Ice Cream Turned To Blood: Aleppo, A Story Of SufferingOp-Ed by Afraa Dagher It has long been Erdogans dream to annex Aleppo for Turkey. Exactly like his predecessor of the Ottoman occupation stole a part of Syrian land known as Iskenderun. Today, July 9, 2016 was the worst day for Aleppo. The so-called moderate rebels launched their advanced missiles on residential neighborhoods hitting residential buildings and other civilian locations, including an ice cream parlor. This was supposed to be the time for the people to have some small joy after a month of worship and fasting during Ramadan. It is now time for Break-fast Eid, to denote the end of Ramadan. This is a well-known tradition for Muslims and it is supposed to be well-known even to those who pretend to be Muslims such as groups and gangs like Jaish al-Islam, and Ahrar al-Sham, otherwise known as ISIS. But all this did not prevent those gangs from launching their new and more advanced missiles on places where Syrian children were having their ice cream with their mothers and families. Indeed, most of the victims were women and children with only 50 martyrs and 300 wounded, many of them in critical condition. Thus U.S. and its allies have announced what the people want to hear but, on the ground, there is a different reality altogether. They pretend to support the Syrian people while they supply the terrorists with advanced weapons so they can exact revenge on innocent civilians. Every time the Syrian Arab Army advances, with heavy losses to its ranks and the blood of its soldiers, we have new talks that do nothing but slow the SAA down. On the other side of the Arab world, the Saudi monarch has no shame in supporting, funding, and shipping wahhabists to murder innocent children celebrating an Islamic holiday. On Syrian TV, we were able to see a live transmission from Aleppos hospitals where there was not enough room for the many wounded. Most of them were forced to lay in the corridors. All of this means nothing to the Western mainstream media, nor for the NGOs. Interestingly enough, this same media which has acted as a partner for the genocide against Syrians for years, showed footage of a woman with her full hijab and veil, with not a bit of dust on it, saying she survived the regime bombing. This media not only ignores the truth, they try to cover it up with their lies. They turn the truth upside down. These are war crimes! It is genocide! What else should we call it? It is not merely a matter of a name, however, it is a matter of basic humanity. Image Credit Afraa Dagher is a political analyst currently residing in Syria. She has made numerous media appearances commenting on the current state of affairs inside Syria as well as the nature of the current crisis. She has appeared on RT, PRESS TV, and is a regular guest on selfnews Post writer Brandon Turbevilles Truth on the Tracks radio program. Her website is www.SyrianaAfrona.wordpress.com.

"American life expectancy is in decline for the first time since 1993, when H.I.V.-related deaths were at their peak. But this time, researchers canâ€™t identify a single problem driving the drop, and are instead pointing to a number of factors, from heart disease to suicides, that have caused a greater number of deaths.A study on mortality rates released on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics showed that Americans could expect to live for 78.8 years in 2015, a decrease of 0.1 from the year before. The overall death rate increased 1.2 percent â€” thatâ€™s about 86,212 more deaths than those recorded in 2014.Dr. Peter Muennig, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia Universityâ€™s Mailman School of Public Health, said in an interview that the decline was a â€œuniquely American phenomenonâ€ in comparison with other developed countries, like Japan or Sweden.â€œA 0.1 decrease is huge,â€ Dr. Muennig said. â€œLife expectancy increases, and thatâ€™s very consistent and predictable, so to see it decrease, thatâ€™s very alarming.â€For researchers, the numbers reflect a culmination of problems: eight of the top 10 causes of death showed an increase in death rates, including those from heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease. Deaths from Alzheimerâ€™s rose 15.7 percent, unintentional injuries rose 6.7 percent and suicide rose 2.3 percent.The infant mortality rate, often the marker researchers use to gauge the health of a population, rose slightly, but Dr. Jiaquan Xu, one of the authors of the study, said that the rise was not considered significant.Dr. Muennig said that popular theories for the cause of the decline, including an increase in obesity rates and an opiod epidemic, fail to explain a problem that feels broader.â€œIf you actually dissect the data neither of those arguments hold,â€ he said. â€œThis report slams it home that this is really a mystery.â€Dr. Xu said that the studyâ€™s lone bright spot showed a decline in deaths from cancer, by 1.7 percent.â€œThatâ€™s the only part thatâ€™s good news,â€ he said.The study is further confirmation of a decline in health in different racial populations. Death rates among non-Hispanic black males rose 0.9, and 1 percent among non-Hispanic white males. Rates for non-Hispanic white females rose 1.6 percent.Rates for non-Hispanic black females, Hispanic males, and Hispanic females held steady from 2014 to 2015.Dr. Muennig said that a decline in the health of working class whites was a major contributor to the latest survey results. Life expectancy for whites has stagnated or dipped in recent years, fueled by vulnerability to drug and alcohol abuse, suicide and economic distress.â€œItâ€™s not happening to black people,â€ Dr. Muennig said. â€œThat group used to have a huge and growing disparity with whites, but that gap has radically narrowed.â€In 2014, the life expectancy gap between black and white people closed to 3.4 years, the smallest on record.Thursdayâ€™s survey did not break people down by income or education level, but past research has shown that as the gap between the rich and poor in America widens, people of different income levels can expect to live for different lengths of time.In February, researchers at the Brookings Institution analyzed life expectancies for men who were among the top 10 percent of earners, and those who were among the bottom 10 percent. For men born in 1950, life expectancy was 14 years shorter than for those among the rich.Dr. Muennig said that researchers suspect that the strain of income inequality in the United States â€” and the stress that this causes â€” could be a major contributing factor to the uptick, but it has been hard to prove beyond one thread of research that studies how earned-income tax credits can help improve the health of people with low incomes.Yes. According to the data, life expectancy for females remains consistently higher than it for males. In 2015, the difference in life expectancy between females and males increased to 4.9 years in 2015, up from 4.8 years in 2014.Dr. Xu said in an interview that the decline doesnâ€™t necessarily show a trend, but that the numbers are cause for concern.â€œIf a year from now if this situation continues,â€ Dr. Xu said, â€œitâ€™s definitely a problem for public health.â€",1
"Cities Across the Nation Demand Gun-Control LegislationSusanne Posel, Contributor Invoking the Sandy Hook shooting as justification, Menino said: I understand the second amendment, the right to bear arms. But I dont understand how young kids should be able to get guns. Menino is anxious to have legislation moving and moving quickly. In Rhode Island, Providence City Councilors demanded a resolution to ban the sale, use and possession of semi-automatic guns. Seth Yurdin, Council Majority Leader explained: Banning semi-automatic firearms is a public safety imperative. We cannot wait for another tragedy, another senseless loss of life, before we act. In the Twin Cities, specifically St. Paul, the local city council has requested that lawmakers crackdown on semi-automatic weapons and high capacity magazines. Gun ownership restrictions for the mentally ill Vincent Fort, Georgia State Senator has plans to introduce gun-control bills this year on types of rifles and high-capacity magazines. Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia is recommending arming teachers in schools, while his opponent in the electoral race, Terry McAuliffe, says that there should be a one handgun purchase limit statewide. Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has done an about-face on gun restrictions, now supporting the coming gun bans. Governor Martin OMalley of Maryland has legislation in the works that would limit the type of gun that can be purchased in his state; restrict access to the mentally ill; on top of the assault weapons ban already implemented. Edward Suslovic, city councilor in Portland, Oregon believes that individual states should change the laws so that towns and cities can devise their own statues on gun restrictions. Suslovic and the Public Safety, Health and Human Services Committee will request that there be a bill submitted to empower cities to ban guns from government buildings. The Maine State Chamber of Commerce is planning to allow guns on college campuses, while already permitting employees with concealed-weapons permits to leave guns locked in their cars at work. Thomas Franklin, member of the Maine Citizens Against Handgun Violence is asserting that officials in Washington show the nation that grief can be turned into action by not cowering to the National Rifle Association (NRA). The Nevada Legislature has upheld the rights of the 2nd Amendment by passing NRS 268.418 which restricts lawmakers from stringent gun bans by stating: No city may infringe upon those rights and powers; except that cities may proscribe by ordinance or regulation the unsafe discharge of firearms. The other side of this legislation confuses citizens who travel from jurisdiction to jurisdiction that may allow guns in one and not in another. This means that a simple pull-over could turn into an arrest on violation of the specifics of each countys gun-ban ordinances. Tim Burgess, Seattle City Council member has brought forward a gun-safety amendment that will seek to ban all rifles and assault weapons in 2013, as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines. Universal background checks along with micro-stamping technology would give the local police departments more accurate tracing when bullets are fired from a gun. The proposal passed unanimously. Bruce Harrell, another council member, requested a special committee to oversee authority to cities on gun regulations comprised of police, prosecutors, public-health workers and youth advocates. House Representative Marcy Toepel wants to have laws in place to control straw purchasers who buy guns and supply them to criminals, inspired by officer Brad Fox who was killed by a straw-purchased gun.

"An alarming report published this week by researchers at the University of Iowa revealed that over 15,000 Americans vanish without a trace from Fall Fest hayride wagons every year. Our data shows that, each autumn, between 1 and 2 percent of all Fall Fest attendees who climb up onto the back of straw-covered wagons and embark on tractor-pulled hayrides never return, said the reports lead author, Simon Shaw, noting that on the average hayride, at least two or three passengers will unexpectedly go missing and be lost forever. Last year alone, we catalogued over 8,000 cases in which passengers disappeared from the wagon before they even reached the pumpkin patch, leaving behind nothing but empty hay bales where they once sat and overturned cups of steaming hot apple cider. The report also discovered over 1,000 recorded instances of tractors emerging from cornfields without their drivers or any passengers at all, slowly trundling back toward the festival grounds with not a soul in sight.

"In the town where Abraham Lincoln addressed a shattered nation in 1863, Donald Trump gave one of the most detailed policy speeches of his campaign last month. As the US â€“ and the world â€“ wait to see which elements of the incoming presidentâ€™s inflammatory campaign he will attempt to pursue from the White House, this speech may be something of a guide. Alan Yuhas examines the likelihood of each of the 18 presidential acts and 10 bills Trump outlined in Gettysburg becoming reality. The checks and balances of the US system will partially constrain Trump, as with any US president. But the eight-justice supreme court is likely to soon have a ninth, conservative justice once Trump takes office, and Congress is controlled by his fellow Republicans. State governments may resist some of the next presidentâ€™s initiatives by taking his administration to court.   Related: Donald Trump, pragmatist? President-elect's stances seem to shift after win   But Trump will also have great leeway to act on his own, in line with precedents set by George W Bush and Barack Obama to expand the powers of the executive branch. The text is drawn from Trumpâ€™s campaign site.  On the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;  Trump can propose an amendment and Congress can reject it. The Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, first took office in 1985 and has already said he opposes term limits.  SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);  Trump will have the power to halt hiring at federal agencies, but he has also said he would expand the size of agencies he has exempted (such as the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and military). There are about 2.85 million federal employees, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics.  THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;  Trump requires Congress to repeal regulations, and will almost certainly have its support to strip away environmental protections and financial regulations. His â€œrequirementâ€ is ambitious in its scope but Republicans have fought to deregulate banking and the oil and gas industry for decades.   FOURTH, a 5 year-ban [sic] on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.  Trump would need Congressâ€™s help to truly cement such bans, though he could create rules for his White House staffers. Congress would not likely support a ban for its ex-lawmakers. More than 400 former members of the 112th and 111th Congresses have become lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, including some of the most powerful former lawmakers. Conveniently for Trump, this five-year ban, at the moment, would primarily affect Democrats ousted from Congress and the Obama administration since 2011. His transition team, on the other hand, is already being filled with former lobbyists and courted by current ones.  Bans on foreign interference could create legal knots for the Trump White House, however. He has a host of foreign business entanglements, with as many possible conflicts of interest, and a great deal still unknown about his dealings abroad.  On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers: FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205  Actual renegotiation of a major trade deal could prove difficult: it took years of work across George HW Bush and Bill Clintonâ€™s White Houses to finalize the deal. Restructuring or withdrawing would also present a logistical nightmare, since car and airplane manufacturing, for instance, are already global, multinational industries.     Why America elected Trump  But Trump could quickly hollow out the trade deal by enforcing some provisions harshly and not others, as he has promised, though this could cause litigation, higher consumer prices and/or a trade war with countries such as Mexico.  SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator  Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, a Republican and Democrat respectively, said on Friday that Barack Obamaâ€™s long-planned Trans Pacific Partnership was in effect killed by the election. Ironically, the deal was designed in large part to curb Chinaâ€™s economic influence in the Pacific, and its nullification will not improve US ties to would-be partners, who will probably turn to their closer neighbor. Nor will Trumpâ€™s direction to his treasury secretary, which is in his power, improve relations with China.  FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and US Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately  Trump will have the power to direct enforcement priorities for his cabinet members, who can sue companies or countries they believe culpable of abuses.  FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50tn dollarsâ€™ [sic] worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to UN climate change programs and use the money to fix Americaâ€™s water and environmental infrastructure  Trump will be able to reverse any and all of Barack Obamaâ€™s executive actions on climate change, including his block on the Keystone Pipeline, which he ruled against after a state department review found it would not significantly create jobs, lower the price of gas or break US dependency on oil imports.  As president, Trump will become the only leader of a large industrialized nation to doubt climate change, a crisis which even leaders such as the Philippinesâ€™ Rodrigo Duterte and Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin have pledged to act on. Trump could simply ignore the US commitment to the Paris climate accord, though withdrawal would take four years. He has appointed a climate skeptic, whose organization is in part funded by coal companies, to head his EPA transition team, and could also try to gut Obamaâ€™s environmental regulations, though he would face a fight in the courts, within agencies and from states such as California. And Trumpâ€™s ambitions to resurrect the coal industry face a larger problem than environmental safety laws: decades of economic decline, driven by the boom of natural gas. His promise to â€œfixâ€ water and environmental infrastructure also runs directly afoul of his promises to reinvest in the coal and natural gas industries, the latter linked to earthquakes and the former to air and water pollution.  Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama  Trump will have great leeway to rescind executive orders, though he would almost immediately run into practical problems in undoing them. He can revoke Obamaâ€™s 2012 order to protect about 1.3 million young migrants, for instance, leaving them vulnerable to, if still not the priority for, deportation. Any orders relating to Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare act, as with environmental orders, would be sent into the gears of bureaucracy, and could disrupt an already nervous healthcare industry. He could also rescind Obamaâ€™s ban on torture, but would almost certainly face the courts for this decision (where a majority-conservative supreme court could, eventually, accept the decision).  SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States  Trump released two lists of names, totaling 21 names, though Senator Mike Lee refused consideration. It is the presidentâ€™s prerogative to nominate supreme court justices, though this year the Republican-controlled Senate has shifted the balance of power between the branches by its unprecedented block on even hearing Barack Obamaâ€™s pick, Merrick Garland.  THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities  Trump would have the ability to revoke federal funding to cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Texas, Miami and Chicago, whose local governments try to shield migrants without criminal histories. So far, the mayors of New York, LA, San Francisco, and Seattle have pledged to defy Trump. The president has only weak legal power to meddle in city politics, but he could threaten them with withdrawing funding.  FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that wonâ€™t take them back  Trump has promised to deport migrants with criminal records and without papers, and to expand the definition of â€œcriminal alienâ€. As president, he will have discretion to guide law enforcement priorities as widely as he sees fit.     Trumpâ€™s top priorities: immigration, healthcare and jobs  Trumpâ€™s second pledge refers to a punitive action that the state department can take against countries that refuse to accept deported people. In 2001, the supreme court ruled that the US cannot detain migrants longer than six months if their home country refuses them, even in cases with criminal records (Trump spent much of campaign falsely blaming Obama for â€œcatch and releaseâ€ of migrants, when the president was actually following the law and had deported a record number of people). Trumpâ€™s only recourse in the cases of these â€œrecalcitrantâ€ countries is a little-used tactic, denial of visas, which would almost certainly strain diplomatic relations.  FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.  Trumpâ€™s 2015 pledge to â€œban all Muslimsâ€ from entering the US eventually became a promise to suspend migration from unspecified countries. Most of the power to regulate immigration lies with Congress, and constitutional experts are divided about whether such a ban could be ruled legal. Whatâ€™s more, as the scholar Lyle Denniston wrote in December, â€œthe supreme court has never decided specifically whether a religious preference could be a valid basis for exclusionâ€. Trumpâ€™s â€œextreme vettingâ€ also rests on uncertain constitutional grounds, especially in the context of a proposed religious test. The US already has extraordinarily strict screening procedures for migrants and refugees, but presidents have wide discretion for enforcement powers. The fight over such a ban would land in all three branches of government.  Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with two children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15%, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10% rate.  Neither the conservative Tax Foundation nor the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center have predicted major tax benefits to the middle class from Trumpâ€™s plan. It would vastly benefit the highest earners, and increase the deficit by several trillion dollars over 10 years, according to their estimates.  End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the US tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1tn in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make two and four-year college more affordable [sic].  Trump could use federal funding as a carrot and a stick â€“ benefits for compliant states, withdrawal for reluctant ones â€“ to try to persuade states to abandon Common Core educational standards, but he will not have power except to advise and make recommendations to them. He has also not said how he would fund his school voucher program.  Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.  Trump has been similarly vague about how he would replace the Affordable Care Act, which the Republican-controlled Congress will almost certainly try to gut, if not repeal. Millions of people stand poised to lose healthcare coverage, and itâ€™s not clear how the removal of government programs, in an industry six years into adjusting to them, would affect private providers or premiums.

FBI data showed a 10.8% single-year increase in violent crime in 2015, though national rates remain near historic lows and about half of their peak in the early 1990s. As the chief of federal law enforcement, Trump could instruct the justice department to allocate funding for militarized gear to police departments, and to rewrite Obamaâ€™s guidelines for police departments, away from community policing standards and toward more aggressive tactics, such as stop-and-frisk, which would probably land the Trump administration in court over its legality.

"An effective transport network is essential to keep a region moving, to create access to jobs, training, public services, and to support a regionâ€™s sustainable economic growth. Bus services are the most important element of the transport network. In Greater Manchester, four in every five public transport journeys are made by bus, and more people travel to work by bus than by all other means of public transport put together.   Related: Wait for a bus and then tell me the market knows best | Owen Jones   But in the 30 years since buses were deregulated, there has been a 40% fall in the number of journeys being made by bus in Greater Manchester. This is despite a growing population and increased demand on our transport network.  London is the only place in Britain to which the legislation didnâ€™t apply. In the same 30 years, the number of passenger journeys on Londonâ€™s franchised bus network has doubled. This has kept the city moving and growing, despite the high demands on their network. So what is the difference between Greater Manchester and London? In Greater Manchesterâ€™s deregulated bus system the private bus companies set the routes, frequencies, timetables, fares and quality standards for services. Naturally, these are primarily informed by their individual commercial interests â€“ and these havenâ€™t aligned with Greater Manchesterâ€™s.  Hundreds of millions of pounds of public funding has been invested [pdf] in our bus infrastructure, including priority routes for buses through busy city and urban centres, new bus stations, and the thousands of bus shelters and bus stops across the city region. In addition, the public purse supports one in five bus services in Greater Manchester, makes fuel cheaper for bus companies, and pays for free or discounted travel for younger people, older people and people with disabilities. Thatâ€™s around Â£100m a year, equivalent to around 40% of the revenues in the bus market.   It has been impossible for the deregulated market to meet the needs of Greater Manchester   Despite the best efforts of Transport for Greater Manchester and the bus companies, it has been impossible for the deregulated market to meet the needs of Greater Manchester. Passengers in London get bus services that connect with other transport modes and get people where they want to go. They have simple, integrated fares and ticketing, and consistent quality standards. And as a result, passenger numbers have grown. That is what we need in Greater Manchester. After 30 years, change is finally on the way. The bus services bill going through Parliament will give the elected mayor of Greater Manchester the ability to franchise bus services. This could mean that before 2020, people in Greater Manchester could, after three decades, finally start getting on board buses and trams coordinated by the local transport authority.  Under a franchised system the mayor can decide the routes, frequencies, timetables, fares and quality standards for bus services in the city-region. The services will still be run by private operators, which will compete with each other through a procurement process open to all operators â€“ not only those that operate in the area. It will bring together the best of the public and private sectors to deliver better transport for customers and for the city region.   Related: Finally, councils will have the power to improve local bus services   This will help deliver a consistent, integrated transport network which effectively integrates with other transport modes and makes it possible for every passenger to use their tickets on any bus in Greater Manchester, as well as other forms of public transport.  Of course, there will be challenges. Any changes to the bus market will need to be implemented in a structured and phased manner. We are adamant that we will not see a repeat of the chaos that followed the overnight change to a deregulated system 30 years ago. These are challenges that we must overcome. Our city region deserves a bus network that will make travel easier, and better connect people and places.

"Unlike most instances of forced child labor in agriculture, this mass mobilization is not driven by exploitative plantation owners or desperate families, but by the government. Each year during the three-month harvest, Uzbek authorities shut down hundreds of schools, hospitals and public offices. Along with the children, thousands of teachers, doctors and public administrators are forced into the fields. What makes this mass forced labor uniquely pernicious is the fact that it is dictated and directed by the authoritarian Uzbek government and is executed on a scale unmatched anywhere in the world. Uzbekistan, the world's third-largest exporter of raw cotton, generates about $1 billion a year by exporting cotton. The government and bosses of state-owned enterprises reap the profits. Children who toil in the fields receive little more than meager meals for their labor. President Islam Karimov, the strongman leader in Uzbekistan since Soviet times, has not only suppressed democracy, he has maintained his regime's rigid monopoly as the sole purchaser of cotton grown in the country. Uzbek farmers are required to sell their cotton to state trading agencies at less than one-third the world market price. In turn, the government sells the cotton on commodity exchanges at the market price, guaranteeing huge profits for those in charge. Consumers and companies in the West prop up this monstrous system by unwittingly purchasing cotton harvested by forced child labor. Supply chain analysts have determined that most Uzbek cotton is sold to countries in South Asia and Eastern Europe. From there, the cotton is processed and turned into garments sold in retail stores in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. In 2007, a group of nongovernmental organizations and socially responsible investors brought the plight of Uzbekistan's children to the attention of U.S. apparel brands and retailers. Since then, a remarkable network of retailers, manufacturers, faith-based investors and others has come together to persuade the Uzbek government to end its use of forced child labor. Unlike many other social justice campaigns, this effort enjoys the strong support of some of the world's largest users of cotton. More than 25 major brands and retailers have joined the campaign to end forced child labor in Uzbekistan, including American Eagle Outfitters, Bed Bath & Beyond, Gap Inc., JC Penney, Kohl's, Levi Strauss & Co., Limited Brands, Nike, Nordstrom, Timberland, TJX Cos. Inc., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., Target, the Walt Disney Co. and Wal-Mart. Several of these companies have instructed their suppliers not to buy Uzbek cotton until the government takes meaningful steps to restore basic human rights in its cotton sector. Four U.S. trade associations -- representing more than 90 percent of U.S. purchases of cotton and cotton-based merchandise -- have sent letters to the U.S. State Department, Department of Labor, the United Nations International Labor Organization and Karimov demanding an immediate stop to state-mandated forced child labor. Regrettably, the Uzbek government has opted to play a game of empty promises. It makes verbal commitments to change the current forced labor system, but it consistently fails to do so. In April, I introduced a resolution calling on the Uzbek government to allow the International Labor Organization to conduct an independent assessment of forced labor during the 2009 cotton harvest. In response, Uzbekistan's deputy foreign minister personally pledged to me that his government would consider allowing the ILO assessment to go forward. Five months later, there has been zero action. Uzbekistan recently ratified ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age and Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, but it has continued to brazenly violate both measures. By dragging its feet on reform and refusing to honor international agreements, the Uzbek government risks a major backlash in the U.S. and elsewhere. It is time for the Uzbek government to begin acting in good faith. It should immediately invite the ILO to send an expert observer and assessment mission to Uzbekistan as a prelude to the long-term engagement necessary to reduce and ultimately end forced child labor in that country's cotton fields. It should allow Uzbek children to leave the fields and return to school. Sen. Harkin, D-Iowa, is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and a longtime leader in the fight to end abusive child labor around the globe. ",1
"Why Are Americans Paying to Be Searched, Spied On, Shot At and Robbed Blind by the Government?To force a man to pay for the violation of his own liberty is indeed an addition of insult to injury.Benjamin Tucker, 19th century advocate of American individualist anarchism The State Department wants $400,000 to purchase a fiberglass sculpture of a camel looking at a needle for its new embassy in Pakistan. Theyve already spent their allotted $630,000 to increase the number of likes and fans on their Facebook and Twitter pages. The NATO ambassador for the U.S. needs $700,000 for landscaping and gardening, the National Science Foundation would like $700,000 to put on a theatrical production about climate change, and the Senate staffers need $1.9 million for lifestyle coaching. Also, Yale University researchers could really use $384,000 so they can study the odd cork-screw shape of a ducks penis. I promise this is no belated April Fools joke. These are actual line items paid for by American taxpayers, whose tax dollars continue to be wasted on extravagant, unnecessary items that serve no greater purpose than to fatten the wallets of corporations and feed political graft (such as the $1 million bus stop, complete with heated benches and sidewalks which can only shelter 15 people and provides little protection from rain, snow, or the sun). Case in point: despite the fact that we have 46 million Americans living at or below the poverty line, 16 million children living in households without adequate access to food, and at least 900,000 veterans relying on food stamps, enormous sums continue to be doled out for presidential vacations ($16 million for trips to Africa and Hawaii), overtime fraud at the Department of Homeland Security (nearly $9 million in improper overtime claims, and thats just in six of the DHS many offices), and Hollywood movie productions ($10 million was spent by the Army National Guard on Superman movie tie-ins aimed at increasing awareness about the National Guard). Consider that since 2001, Americans have spent $10.5 million every hour for numerous foreign military occupations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. Theres also the $2.2 million spent every hour on maintaining the United States nuclear stockpile, and the $35,000 spent every hour to produce and maintain our collection of Tomahawk missiles. And then theres the money the government exports to other countries to support their arsenals, at the cost of $1.61 million every hour for the American taxpayers. Then theres the U.S. Supreme Courts recent decision in McCutcheon v. FEC, which reinforces a government mindset in which the rights of the wealthy are affirmed by the courts, while the rights of average, working class Americans are routinely dismissed as secondary to corporate and governmental concerns. Under the guise of protecting free speech, a divided 5-4 Court did away with established limits on the number of candidates an individual can support with campaign contributions. In doing so, the justices expanded on the Courts landmark 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which not only gave unfettered free speech rights to corporations but paved the way for corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money promoting candidates, especially presidential candidates. What this does, of course, is turn the ballot box into an auction block, wherein those who are elected to public office are bought and paid for by those who can afford to support their campaignsnamely, lobbyists, corporations and high-dollar donors. (Then again, perhaps it will remain status quo. According to a 2013 study by Trinity University, U.S. Senators do not take into account the opinions and wishes of their lower class constituents. Rather, their voting was aligned with their upper class constituents. This dismissal of lower class opinion held true for both Republican and Democratic Senators, themselves made up of millionaires.) When all is said and done, what we are witnessing is the emergence of a disconcerting government mindset that interprets the Constitution one way for corporations, government entities and the wealthy, and uses a second measure altogether for average Americans. For example, contrast the Supreme Courts affirmation of the free speech rights of corporations and wealthy donors in McCutcheon and Citizens United with its tendency to deny those same rights to average Americans when government interests abound, such as in its 2012 decision in Reichle v. Howards, where a unanimous Supreme Court allowed immunity protections for Secret Service agents to trump the free speech rights of Americans, and youll find a noticeable disparity. Unfortunately, as I point out in my book A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State, this constitutional double standard is coming to bear in all aspects of our lives, not just in the realm of campaign finance law. It allows lobbyists intimate access to our elected officials, while prohibiting Americans from even standing silently in protest near a government building; it grants immunity to police officers who shoot unarmed citizens, while harshly punishing Americans who attempt to defend themselves, mistaking a SWAT team raid for a home invasion; and it gives government agents carte blanche access to Americans communications and activities, while allowing the government to operate in secret, with secret hearings, secret budgets and secret agendas. This is a far cry from how a representative government is supposed to operate. Indeed, it has been a long time since we could claim to be the masters of our own lives. Rather, we are now the subjects of a militarized, corporate empire in which the vast majority of the citizenry work their hands to the bone for the benefit of a privileged few. Adding injury to the ongoing insult of having our tax dollars misused and our so-called representatives bought and paid for by the moneyed elite, the government then turns around and uses the money we earn with our blood, sweat and tears to target, imprison and entrap us, in the form of militarized police, surveillance cameras, private prisons, license plate readers, drones, and cell phone tracking technology. All of those nefarious deeds that you read about in the paper every day: those are your tax dollars at work. Its your money that allows for government agents to spy on your emails, your phone calls, your text messages, and your movements. Its your money that allows out-of-control police officers to burst into innocent peoples homes, or probe and strip search motorists on the side of the road. And its your money that leads to innocent Americans across the country being prosecuted for innocuous activities such as raising chickens at home, growing vegetable gardens, and trying to live off the grid. Just remember the next time you see a news story that makes your blood boil, whether its a police officer arresting someone for filming them in public, or a child being kicked out of school for shooting an imaginary arrow, or a homeowner being threatened with fines for building a pond in his backyard, remember that it is your tax dollars that are paying for these injustices. So what are you going to do about it? There was a time in our history when our forebears said enough is enough and stopped paying their taxes to what they considered an illegitimate government. They stood their ground and refused to support a system that was slowly choking out any attempts at self-governance, and which refused to be held accountable for its crimes against the people. Their resistance sowed the seeds for the revolution that would follow. Unfortunately, in the 200-plus years since we established our own government, weve let bankers, turncoats and number-crunching bureaucrats muddy the waters and pilfer the accounts to such an extent that were back where we started. Once again, weve got a despotic regime with an imperial ruler doing as they please. Once again, weve got a judicial system insisting we have no rights under a government which demands that the people march in lockstep with its dictates. And once again, weve got to decide whether well keep marching or break stride and make a turn toward freedom. But what if we didnt just pull out our pocketbooks and pony up to the federal governments outrageous demands for more money? What if we didnt just dutifully line up to drop our hard-earned dollars into the collection bucket, no questions asked about how it will be spent? What if, instead of quietly sending in our checks, hoping vainly for some meager return, we did a little calculating of our own and started deducting from our taxes those programs that we refuse to support? If we dont have the right to decide what happens to our hard-earned cash, then we dont have very many rights at all. If they can just take from you what they want, when they want, and then use it however they want, you cant claim to be anything more than a serf in a land they think of as theirs. This was the case in the colonial era, and its the case once again. Constitutional attorney and author John W. Whitehead is founder and president of The Rutherford Institute. He is the author of A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State andThe Change Manifesto. ",0
"A stirring argument against dams can be made by the outdoors itself: the rivers, trees, wildlife and vibrant contours of an organically forged landscape. â€œDamNationâ€ begins with such images of nature, often artfully framed, and returns to them as well as to some beautifully fine-grained archival photography. But this documentary (which was funded by the outdoor apparel company Patagonia) also lumps together its grievances and interviews in a way that feels scattered and geared toward those inclined to agree.The filmmakers, Ben Knight and Travis Rummel, have obviously dug into the history of their subject, but they blow through a pocket chronology of dams in America with unsettling speed. Their case leans somewhat heavily on the plight of salmon, and the oddly casual voice-over is misjudged. Among the raft of interviewees, the straight-shooting singer Katie Lee and a graffiti-tagging activist shake the film out of its dutiful tracks. But you feel that the filmmakers wouldnâ€™t mind just profiling those two, or one ardent naturalist who spends his monastic days taking notes on a salmon community.If the film is less persuasive for its lack of balance, itâ€™s at least heartening to learn that undesirable dams can be destroyed and their rivers restored to their old ways and means. For vivid proof, â€œDamNationâ€ shows time-lapse sequences of dam demolition and its aftermath that are almost spiritually rejuvenating: a fresh chapter in natureâ€™s story.",1
"In 1900, in a riverside town near Birmingham, England, a 14-year-old white girl who worked in vaudeville had a baby fathered by a fellow vaudevillian, a black American. And so the story behind â€œMabel Madness,â€ Trezana Beverleyâ€™s consistently beguiling solo show at Urban Stages, began.The child, who later became famous as Mabel Mercer, was raised by her grandmother at first, while her teenage mother toured, then by convent nuns. Ms. Beverley, who both wrote and stars in this one-act musical play, makes Mercerâ€™s story compelling, taking her to Paris, where she developed her low-key, storytelling vocal style; she frequently performed while seated in an armchair. Cole Porter, a regular at the club Bricktopâ€™s, adored her.She left for the United States in 1938. A group of friends, including Marlene Dietrich, paid her way, on the ocean liner Queen Mary, because they feared for her safety as Hitlerâ€™s forces advanced. She eventually found love â€” with Harry Beard, her manager. She quickly found ardent fans, among them Frank Sinatra, who sat raptly in the audience during her New York club appearances and asked her to teach him how she did it.When Ms. Beverley sings, she makes the case beautifully for Mercerâ€™s greatness of style. The showâ€™s numbers include a thrilling â€œSummertime,â€ a chilling â€œLove for Saleâ€ and a delightful â€œJust One of Those Thingsâ€ (in which she alternates between singing as Sinatra and as Mercer, who died in 1984).The production itself, directed by Frances Hill and Peter Napolitano, could be more polished. But the heart is there, and Nicholas Blade Guldnerâ€™s video design, with evocative vintage black-and-white images, adds a great deal to its atmosphere.",1
"Cops Say Family Thanked Them For Beating and Arresting Them In Their Own HomeNick Bernabe The only problem with this official story is that its basically completely fabricated. Police saw two men, Luis and Diego Lobaton, smoking cigarettes suspiciously before reentering their own home and place of business to which they had their own keys for. This is when the cops decided that the two men deserved something that they would later be thankful for: thugs with badges forcefully entering their residence, beating, then arresting the brothers, and traumatizing their mother and 3-year-old brother. But where this story really goes off the rails, according to Voice of San Diego, are the discrepancies between the police report and video footage from the stores surveillance camera: Police say Luis, 21, took a fighters stance and that Luis attempted twice to hit one of the officers. Lobaton does not appear to swing or lunge at the officers in the video and actually appears to be backpedaling when an officer rushes inside and begins striking him, says the Voice report. Police say Diego, 20, tried to lock the door to stop officers from going inside. This never happens on the video. Police say the boys mother, Hedy Julca, tried to pull the door shut when one of the officers attempted to talk to Luis. The video shows Julca opening the door, another officer holding it open, and the cops entering the store. Watch the surveillance videos below: (skip to 7:00 minutes in both videos to see what really happened) As you can see, the beating took place in the presence of an infant and an elderly woman,Hedi Julca who was later charged for a crime in the incident. Police were clearly the aggressors against these innocent people who were literally minding their own business. Thankfully, charges were eventually dropped against both her and her sons, and the family is now suing the San Diego Police Department for misconduct. Despite the public outcry following this incident, San Diego police once again followed one of the brothers into the same store, telling their mother he was acting suspicious. The San Diego police department has come under major scrutiny as of late. San Diego law enforcement (including border patrol, Sheriffs etc) have killed over 200 people since records of victims of state violence began being kept, according to UAPTSD.org. San Diegos police chief recently stepped down amid corruption and misconduct in his force. His replacement, Shelley Zimmerman, has been attempting to ease fears by implementing police reforms. One of these reforms was the implementation of body cameras for all San Diego police. The cops involved in this incident were conveniently not wearing their cameras at the time, according to witnesses. Nick Bernabe writes for TheAntiMedia.org, where this article first appeared.

CCR attorney, Omar Farah, said the following: Todays hearing at the IACHR came at a critical moment in Guantnamos troubled history. Our clients report that most of the men at the prison are now in the fifth week of a mass hunger strike to peacefully protest worsening prison conditions, religious provocation, and the crushing reality that after 11 years in indefinite detention, there is no end in sight to their suffering. In light of the humanitarian crisis unfolding at Guantanamo, it is indefensible that the US government failed to answer the Commissions simple questions about how it plans to close the prison camp. Obama officials wont because no plan exists. Guantanamo symbolizes imperial lawlessness. So do other US torture prisons. They exist at home and abroad. Media scoundrels explain nothing. Coverup if official policy. CCR and others gave expert testimony. They discussed how Guantanamo causes psychological harm, deaths, indefinite detentions uncharged, lack of fair trials, and illegitimate US policies restricting the facilitys closure. An earlier CCR report headlined 11 Years and Counting: Profiles of Men Detained at Guantanamo. It explains Americas horrific treatment. Holding detainees uncharged was highlighted. Injustice defines US policy. Individual profiles explain best. Horrific human rights abuses persist. Obama bears full responsibility. Justice remains denied.

"A 48-year-old man has been arrested in Wrexham on suspicion of terrorism offences. Police said the man, whom they did not identify, was held on Thursday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism, under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. He was arrested as part of a joint operation between the Welsh extremism counter-terrorism unit, North Wales police and the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit. A police spokesman said: â€œThe man is being questioned at a police station in the West Midlands. The arrest was preplanned and intelligence-led. There was no threat to the publicâ€™s safety. An address in Wrexham is the subject of an ongoing search.â€ Officers have 48 hours to question the suspect before charging or releasing him or applying for a warrant of further detention.",1
"In the 1920s, before matter could be magnified millions of times under electron microscopes, a German graphic designer was developing his own techniques for capturing the minute wonders of organic life.Carl StrÃ¼we never gained fame during his lifetime, but over the decades his stark images of diatoms, spermatozoa and other life under the microscope have gathered admirers for their distinctive artistry. A selection of his works will go on display at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York starting April 14.When Mr. StrÃ¼we began making photographs, he used microscopes that could only magnify items up to 2,000 times. The traditional scientific view under a microscope was rounded, so Mr. StrÃ¼we cut black pieces of paper into rectangular shapes and set them over the biological subject matter in his slides. He then pointed his camera into the eye of the microscope, capturing the scene he had composed under the microscope.The thoughtful way that he positioned his subjects in the microscope â€” his canvases â€” is what made his work so pioneering, said Gottfried JÃ¤ger, a photographer in Bielefeld, Germany, who is the administrator of Mr. StrÃ¼weâ€™s estate. Mr. StrÃ¼we saw great artistic potential, Mr. JÃ¤ger said, where before him, many only saw the objectivity of science.Mr. Struweâ€™s work had little impact outside of Germany during his life because he lacked resources and did not speak languages other than German.â€œHe was a poor man, not very successful with his work during his own life,â€ said Mr. JÃ¤ger.Mr. StrÃ¼we did make some appearances in the United States, including a Brooklyn Museum show in 1949. A number of his photos were also used in scientific texts, including this biology textbook from 1957.The work of Carl StrÃ¼we may mean more to art history than to science. But Mr. JÃ¤ger believes there is something to be learned from these photographs, even if they do not do much to further objective knowledge.â€œThey open a window in this fantastic, non-visible world,â€ he wrote in an email. â€œHe visualizes its meaning and beauty as its own reality.â€",1
"Govt Denies Hungry Families Thanksgiving Food Because a Pro-Cannabis Group Donated ItBy John Vibes However, the agency later changed their mind and decided that they did not want to accept the donations because they did not want to be associated with asubstance that is now legal in the state. Lindsey Jacobsen, the executive director of Women Leaders in Cannabis in Eugene, told KATU thatthe agency actually gave them a different excuse at first. The first place I reached out to was the Department of Human Services because when I was in high school I was in Future Business Leaders of America and we did the same type of program and thats who we worked with. We discussed in detail how we would make it happen, and a few days later we got a phone call back stating that they wouldnt be able to work with us due to too much time being spent on it, she said. Its disheartening. We have lives just like everybody else, families, jobs. Were just happy to be able to give back now that we have the opportunity to, she added. Gene Evans, a DHS spokesman later admitted in a statement to KATU that the donations would be an embarrassment for the government. Their decision not to accept the donations was based on discomfort with the connection of a marijuana organization to DHS human services. The Eugene office felt that baskets sponsored by this organization could create the impression that we endorsed cannabis, the statement said. I dont see how being involved in a positive way could do any harm. Well keep finding people that want to work with us and I think in the future people will be reaching out to us, hopefully, Jacobsen said after hearing the reason why their donations were rejected. Luckily, the group was quickly able to find a private organization called Autism Rocks to help them distribute their donations.

If the reality of toxic fertilizers and pesticides in your food is not enough for you to refuse it, what is? You got a point on that one and I do vote with my money. If you know any brands of pre-cooked food (other than meat) with no toxins, send me some. All I got is bread some vegetable types. I would also refuse food made by drug addicts though. Its getting harder to find clean food what with the toxic rain. I live in the country and get organic beef from my next door neighbor but we know the cattle are taking up the toxins when it rains on the pasture. Not sure I read that correctly or in the correct context, am pretty sure I am misunderstanding your comment as it would make zero sense. Are you implying that there would be Cannabis in the food? You would have no concerns over that, are you that naive or a moron ? No, but if you think they might be putting pot in food then you are that naive or a moron. To hook up the masses legalize weed, would you believe they would not ? Do you even READ the ingredient lists on your food? Because if you dont, youll be surprised to find the number of drugs listed on the label. Unless its your belief that BHT, MSG, food dyes, Round-Up (not listed, but there) are somehow natural. Yes, yes, I do read them and I purchase the ones with the fewest or least damaging toxins. Seriously? Can you supply one plausible reason why an organization kind and caring enough to collect and donate food would put cannabis in it? For what purpose? If they did that it would immediately become apparent and the backlash would not only harm their cause tremendously, it would put them in serious legal liability. Besides, ODHS said it would be embarrassing. Thats a far cry from potentially tainted. Legalize Weed by getting more people addicted to it, especially the poor. I dont believe anyone would intentionally put cannabis in packaged food stuff .makes no sense what so ever. The stuff is a benign herb that helps people to be able to live with pain and suffering and maybe cure diseases.why would anyone waste it in such a stupid manner? Thats just crazy!!!!! The nice ladies were just being altruistic and helping their fellow man..that is the mindset of a lot of people that use cannabis. They will not take the food because it does not fit the narrative. It is all about the narrative and anything that does not fit will be ignored by the powers that be. Dont worry about it. Make notes of who refused the help and when the time comes, take them out back and put them down. The Revolution has already begun, the shooting hasnt. Mores the pity. new article header: Food donated by drug lords, bought with drug money, denied by Federal Government. Drug lords???? Toke up neighborits going to be a jumpy ride MJ is not a drug. Drugs are synthesized, while pot is an HERB. There have never been any bad side effects, no one has ever died from it and humans have used it for at least 15,000 YEARS. You are far too ignorant on this issue to be commenting. BTW, POT IS LEGAL IN OREGAN so how can govt say it would be sending the message that they endorse drugs??? Says the pot heads. Is alcohol a drug? Is cocaine a drug? The answers from the medical community are yes. Hashish, hash oil, shatter, wax, honeycomb, oil, crumble, sap, are all extractssynthesized, if you willfrom the marijuana plant. This is the group photo of Women Leaders in Cannabis. Do these college girls and mommies look like drug lords to you? Are you asking if anyone can profile drug users just based on their appearance? Are you asking if mothers could possibly be drug users? Are you asking if college girls could possibly be drug users? Thought so You cannot put brains in statues. IDIOTS. Oregons Department of Human Services probably took issue with the organic products. You know how the Gruberment loves Round up in everything. Why get in with the Govt in the first place? LOL, at times thats as bad as working with the government A hungry child does not care who gave them food and the child would probably never have known and the people who were giving the food asked for nothing other than to help end their hunger. The Department of human sources are apparently full of idiots who ever decided not to accept the food should be fired since they do not have the peoples best interest at heart. I have been saying for years that when the facts of marijuana and its Politicized decisions to remain in the good graces of big brother regardless of how many are injured by such gross stupidity! Weed is a drug, it poisons your brain causing hallucinations, it causes addiction loss of brain cells. Remove the THC from Weed and all the ADDICTS will drop it like a skunk, despite the fact that hemp is the curative formula for certain ailments. MJ is famously non-addictive, NO withdrawal effects have ever been found and its been used for at least 15,000 yrs. NO it doesnt cause hallucinations and NO it doesnt cause loss of brain cells new research has found that it actually grows new brain cells and prevents Alzheimers. BTW, I was a drug/alcohol rehab therapist for 16 yrs and never saw one problem caused by MJ. It helps with numerous diseases and even can cure cancer. You are either hopelessly misinformed by Nixon-era scare tactics propaganda or incredibly, criminally ignorant or are a troll. Oooh, famously, I must bow to that. yes, science doesnt count. Because drugs enhance the mind the MAN doesnt want you to do that (Morgan Freeman). You sound hopelessly addicted. Considering that DHS is the larger organization which includes the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP), a sub-division that issues Medical Marijuana cards, does it not seem just a little ridiculous to say DHS doesnt want to be associated with marijuana. Cyberats Cyberats I smoked cannabis all during the 70s and quit because I was tired of the high. I had to resume because of Lyme Disease.I choose not to put pharma into my body any longer because of the damage it does. Ibuprofen ruined my gut flora and caused many added problems. To be so short sided and ill informed to think it is addictive in the form that God made it is well just plain unfair to those of us who have to suffer because of the ignorance of people that judge without knowing the facts. Cannabis does not harm the body and has never killed anyone.pharma kills hundred of thousands a year. I would prefer to be wellbut at least I can feel somewhat normal when I vape and my body rest a spell from the pain and the mental anguish that this disease causes. The Bilderberg folk along with the rest of the people that call the shots want people addicted to pharma.cannabis opens the mind to truth..they did not want the MKULtra slaves to partake because they were afraid it would wake them from their brainwashing. Too many people have been brainwashed into thinking that this healing herb is bad and pharma is goodit was legal till Bayer and all the other mad scientist decided to start pushing poison on the population for mass control and mega bucks.thats the truth. Scientist want to take a benign herb and corrupt it to make it addictive.like they do with everything thing they touch.make it evil and addictive to control the masses. Hubby said Monsanto was wanting to buy up the pot farms..case in point. Then there will be deaths from cannabisControl and slow kill the sheeple with pharma and food and filthy tv.. Sick world and it needs to return to the old ways of healing and say no to drugs!!!!!! ",0
"Five years after announcing that it had â€œcracked the codeâ€ on modular building technology and would open a factory in Brooklyn to construct modules, the developer Forest City Ratner is getting out of the prefab construction business.The firm said on Wednesday that it would sell its factory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard along with the associated technology to a former Forest City executive, Roger Krulak.The decision came as the developer completed construction of the tallest prefabricated steel structure in the world, a 32-story tower at 461 Dean Street in the Pacific Park complex in Brooklyn, which is weeks away from receiving its first tenants.Forest City made the 930 modules that were used to build the tower at the Navy Yard. It had originally planned to use the factory to create the building blocks that could be outfitted with wiring, plumbing, bathrooms and kitchens for each of the 15 buildings planned for Pacific Park, originally known as Atlantic Yards.In those heady days, Forest City had boasted that modular technology would allow the company to build high-rises for 70 percent of the cost of a conventional building and finish the tower in 18 months, or about 75 percent of the typical time of construction.But the tower was plagued by delays and later a bitter dispute between Forest City and its partner, Skanska, which it brought in to run the factory. Forest City ultimately took back control of the factory, reorganized the production process and finished the first tower. That tower ended up taking four years to build, becoming one of the longest construction projects in city history for a single tower.â€œThe bumps we hit, with respect to Skanska, are typical of any start-up,â€ said MaryAnne Gilmartin, the chief executive of Forest City Ratner. â€œThe good news is that weâ€™ve worked out a lot of the bugs and gotten through the growing pains of innovation.â€Mr. Krulak, who oversaw the work on the modular building for Forest City, and recently formed the company Full Stack Modular, said that he and Forest City had worked out the factory mishaps, technology kinks and disputes that turned what was supposed to be a quickly built tower into one of the longest-running construction projects in the city.The building, he said, is proof that the technology works.Mr. Krulak said his company is in talks with several developers to design and build modular buildings in the New York area.â€œModular is the future of the industry,â€ he said. â€œOur systems are not only more efficient and cost effective than conventional building, but also more sustainable and community friendly.â€Neither party would disclose the sale price. But Mr. Krulak said he would retain a labor agreement that Forest City had signed with the construction unions.For more than half a century, the federal government and real estate developers have sought ways to build prefabricated towers that would cut down the time and the expense of high-rise construction.The idea is that the components of a modular tower can be built inside a factory, unaffected by weather, while the foundation for the building is poured. Increasingly today, builders are constructing low-rise structures, up to 10 stories, for schools, apartments and hotels using modular technology.But taller towers were another matter, requiring additional steel reinforcement to contend with severe winds.With four years of painful experience behind him, Mr. Krulak says the manufacturing process is enormously beneficial.â€œThe time to build will decrease by 25 percent,â€ he said. â€œAnd youâ€™ll save between 15 and 20 percentâ€ on the total cost of a project.But there are no plans for a second modular tower at Pacific Park, at least for now.In 2014, Forest City sold 70 percent of the residential development to a Chinese company, Greenland Holding Group, a deep-pocketed company that wanted to complete Atlantic Yards by 2022. Instead of continuing the modular construction, Greenland Holding insisted on conventional construction for the next three buildings.Ms. Gilmartin said that nothing prevents Mr. Krulak from pitching Forest City and Greenland about other towers when Full Stack Modular is up and running.In the meantime, the 32-story tower may not be the tallest modular building for very long. A 40-story building is planned for Singapore, Mr. Krulak said. And modular construction has become very popular throughout Asia and Australia, although few of the buildings are more than 20 stories.â€œItâ€™s almost at the tipping point,â€ Mr. Krulak said. â€œItâ€™s the future.â€",1
"The former Labour minister who is now the BBCâ€™s head of radio and education, is to take on responsibility for its religious affairs programming amid criticism that recent cuts have hit coverage. James Purnell will add the role to his existing responsibilities, said the director general, Tony Hall, following the departure earlier this month of Aaqil Ahmed, who was the corporationâ€™s head of religion and ethics. Hall said the decision meant the BBC was taking â€œone of the big issues of our timesâ€ seriously, and told an invited audience Purnell would make sure BBC output in television, radio and news was â€œjoined upâ€.     Martin Bashir. Photograph: ITV/Rex Features   Hall also appeared to promote Martin Bashir, appointed religious affairs correspondent just two months ago, to the more senior role of â€œreligious editorâ€. Roger Bolton, a broadcaster and trustee of Sandford St Martin, which aims to promote religious programming, was critical of the failure to replace Ahmed, the first Muslim to hold the post, who left the BBC earlier this month. Ahmedâ€™s ability to commission programmes had already been axed as part of cost cuts in 2015. â€œIf they think thatâ€™s the end of the process there will be a great deal of anger,â€ said Bolton of the decision to make one of Hallâ€™s most senior lieutenants responsible. Bolton, who also presents the Feedback programme for BBC Radio 4, said the danger was that â€œthe BBC talks the talk but doesnâ€™t appear to do anything elseâ€. Hall is also to invite religious leaders in the UK to a round table in January as part of an effort to do more to reflect the role of religion in Britain â€“ not just in its news and current affairs, but also in its drama and factual programming. Speaking at the Voice of the Viewer and Listener autumn conference, Hall described religion as â€œone of the big dividing issues of our timeâ€. Asked if the rise in hate crime added to the concern he said it had. Under recent changes, including the departure of Ahmed after seven years, the religion and ethics production team of BBC Studios will come under the management of Factual Scotland.  A BBC source said: â€œThe BBC can and must do more to ensure that the important role faith plays is recognised and reflected in our programming.â€ The source went on to reject accusations that the BBC was â€œin any way diminishing what it does around Christianityâ€. The Daily Mail, among others, has criticised the BBC for increasing its coverage of other faiths at the expense of Songs of Praise, for example.",1
"Hillary To Face Criminal Indictment By U.S. Attorney General Within 60 Days For 1200 Classified Emails Former U.S. attorney Joe DiGenova has made an announcement saying that he is certain Hillary Clinton will face criminal indictment within 60 days. They have reached a critical mass in their investigation of the secretary and all of her senior staff. And, its going to come to a head, I would suggest, in the next 60 days, Joe said. Its going to be a very complex matter for the Department of Justice, but theyre not going to be able to walk away from it. They are now at over 1,200 classified emails. And, thats just for the ones we know about from the State Department. That does not include the ones that the FBI is, in fact, recovering from her hard drives. Hillary Clinton has not been interviewed by the FBI, and once this happens, they will be able to take her down. Hillary has done enough damage as it is. She needs to be put away. Then again, it seems like she always finds a way to elude the law. Do you think Hillary should go to prison for life? ",0
"30 Years Later, America Truly Is Becoming A 1984 SocietyMichael Snyder We live at a time when the government monitors billions of our phone calls and emails and hardly anyone gets upset about it. We live at a time when corporations systematically collect our voiceprints and our televisions watch us. We live at a time when reporters that try to dig into the misdeeds of the government have their computers hacked, and whennearly one out of every three Americans has a file in the FBIs master criminal database. The control freaks that run our society are absolutely obsessed with watching, tracking, recording and monitoring virtually everything that we do. We truly are becoming a 1984 society, and if we continue on the path that we are currently on eventually our world will be transformed into something more hellish than anything that George Orwell ever imagined. These days, virtually every type of government surveillance is taken to the extreme. For example, there is definitely nothing wrong with normal undercover police work. But these days, almost every single federal government agency conducts extensive undercover operations. At this point, even the IRS and the Department of Agriculture rely on undercover operatives to spy on ordinary citizens. So the next time you are visiting a tax preparer, buying a yacht or attending a peaceful political protest, the person standing next to youjust might be a government spy The federal government has significantly expanded undercover operations in recent years, with officers from at least 40 agencies posing as business people, welfare recipients, political protesters and even doctors or ministers to ferret out wrongdoing, records and interviews show. At the Supreme Court, small teams of undercover officers dress as students at large demonstrations outside the courthouse and join the protests to look for suspicious activity, according to officials familiar with the practice. At the Internal Revenue Service, dozens of undercover agents chase suspected tax evaders worldwide, by posing as tax preparers, accountants drug dealers or yacht buyers and more, court records show. Government undercover work has become so extreme that sometimes undercover agents from one agency end up investigating undercover agents from another agency. In fact, there have been times when agents from different government agencies have pulled weapons on each otherwithout even realizing it The extent of those secret operations within the departments can be so high that it leads to severe overlap, such as one undercover agent investigating an alleged criminal, who also turns out to be a fed on duty, law enforcement officials said. There are all sorts of stories about undercover operations gone bad, Jeff Silk, a longtime undercover agent and supervisor at the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in an interview. People are always tripping and falling over each others cases. Silk added that in some instances, agents even draw weapons on each other before realizing they are on the same side. The government also uses a vast array of electronic methods to spy on all of us. For instance, it has recently been revealed that the Justice Department places devices that emulate cell phone towers on Cessna airplanes and flies them around major cities. These devices are then used to trace the phones of potential targets The U.S. Department of Justice is putting devices that emulate cellphone towers in Cessna aircraft and flying them around the country to track the locations of cell phones, a practice that targets criminal suspects but may also affect thousands of U.S. citizens, according to a news report Thursday. The program is run by the Department of Justices U.S. Marshals Service and has been in operation since at least 2007, according to the report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited two unnamed sources. The aircraft are flown out of at least five metropolitan-area airports and can cover most of the U.S. population, it said. Cell phones are programmed to connect to whichever nearby cell tower has the strongest signal. The fake cell towers trick phones into thinking they have the strongest signal, then read the devices unique registration numbers when they connect, the Journal report says. And of course this is just one example of how the government uses technology to monitor us. For quite a few more examples, please see my previous article entitled 15 Signs That We Live During A Time Of Rampant Government Paranoia. At this point things have gotten so bad that even our public schools are training our children for life in a Big Brother police state. When I was growing up, it would have been unthinkable for men with guns to come storming into a classroom. But now it is a regular occurrence all across the nation. And sometimes the students are not even told that a drill is taking place. The following is an excerpt from a news story about one of these drills that just took placedown in Florida Lauren Marionneaux, a seventh-grade student at Jewett Middle Academy, said it was about 9 a.m. Thursday when the principal announced the school was going on lockdown. Students huddled into classrooms waiting for further instructions. Instead, they started hearing voices in the hallway. A lot of people started getting scared because we thought it was a real drill, Lauren said. We actually thought that someone was going to come in there and kill us. Two police officers burst into Laurens classroom with their guns drawn one carrying, what Winter Haven police said, was an AR-15 rifle. Would you want your little girl to feel like she is about to die? I certainly would not. But this kind of thing is done to condition our young people to life in a police state. They are going to grow up thinking that it is normal for heavily armed men in dark suits to storm in and lock everything down. Even though we are not in prison, we are being systematically trained to act as if we were. Our police forces are being increasingly militarized, and all law enforcement authorities are now trained to bark orders at the general public and treat them like dirt. Most of the population fears those in authority these days, and that is precisely how those in power want it. And asJohn Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute has pointed out, anyone that dares to resist this brutality is squashed like a bug For example, police arrested Chaumtoli Huq because she failed to promptly comply when ordered to move along while waiting outside a Ruby Tuesdays restaurant for her children, who were inside with their father, using the bathroom. NYPD officers grabbed Huq, a lawyer with the New York City Public Advocates office, flipped her around, pressed her against a wall, handcuffed her, searched her purse, arrested her, and told her to shut up when she cried out for help, before detaining her for nine hours. Huq was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Oregon resident Fred Marlow was jailed and charged with interfering and resisting arrest after he filmed a SWAT team raid that took place across the street from his apartment and uploaded the footage to the internet. The footage shows police officers threatening Marlow, who was awoken by the sounds of multiple bombs blasting and glass breaking and ran outside to investigate only to be threatened with arrest if he didnt follow orders and return inside. Eric Garner, 43 years old, asthmatic and unarmed, died after being put in a chokehold by NYPD police, allegedly for resisting arrest over his selling untaxed, loose cigarettes, although video footage of the incident shows little resistance on Garners part. Indeed, the man was screaming, begging and insisting he couldnt breathe. And what was New York Mayor Bill De Blasios advice to citizens in order to avoid a similar fate? Dont resist arrest. Yes, we still have a bit more freedom than the poor souls in George Orwells 1984, but our liberties and freedoms are eroding a little bit more with each passing day. And just like in 1984, most of the population has come to accept the status quo as the new normal. So is there any hope that we will wake up, or will our society continue to march toward oblivion?

"As Obama Preps To Send Troops Into Syria The US Govt Is Already Planning Their Next Major CoupBy Claire Bernish Indeed, though the controversy over quintupling U.S. ground troops in Syria despite vows by the Obama administration at least 16 times there would be no boots on the ground constitutes a valid and pertinent debate, it cant be allowed to obfuscate whats taking place in Brazil. To understand the importance of the ongoing tumult, you need only look at who matters to both the Brazilian and U.S. political elite and it clearly isnt the 54 million people who re-elected Brazils first female president just 18 months ago. In fact, the U.S. State Department has all but publicly asserted its support for the usurpation of power by Brazils center-right Social Democracy Party (PDSB) perhaps because, as has been suggested by many, U.S. fingerprints are all over the coup. What better way to thwart Brazils successful dealings with Russia and China, as part of the BRICS economic alliance, than to insert an oligarchical leader whose party heavily favors U.S. interests. First, its necessary to revisit the mechanics of the coup as well as the controversy surrounding those involved. Brazils lower house of Congress voted to impeach Rousseff on April 17 on the premise of her alleged complicity in albeit relatively minor corruption. But the true impetus for Rousseffs removal, contrary to the narrative championed by Brazils corporate media, is transparently evidenced in those calling for it and in whom they wish to replace her with. Bruno Arajo, a congressman who has been implicated as possibly receiving funds from a construction giant embroiled in a corruption scandal, helped tip the vote for impeachment earlier this month. Arajo, as the Intercept reported, belongs to the same PDSB party that lost four elections in a row to Rousseffs Workers Party (PT). [T]he most important means for understanding the truly anti-democratic nature of whats taking place, the Intercepts Glenn Greenwald explained, is to look at the person whom Brazilian oligarchs and their media organs are trying to install as president: the corruption-tainted, deeply unpopular, oligarch-serving Vice President Michael Temer. For all the negative attention trained on Rousseff, Temers unpopular image and duplicitous dealings are worse, and could be worthy of his own impeachment proceedings. And he isnt alone. Altogether, 60 percent of the 594 members of Brazils Congress face serious charges like bribery, electoral fraud, illegal deforestation, kidnapping and homicide, as The New York Times cited corruption watchdog, Transparency Brazil. But PDSB seeks to bypass that not-at-all minor detail through Rouseffs impeachment which, if successful, would automatically bring Temer to power much to the satisfaction of the United States government. To wit, another major figure pushing for the removal of Rousseff, Senator Aloysio Nunes, traveled to Washington, D.C., the day after the impeachment vote to consult with the third most powerful State Department official, Thomas Shannon, in a closed-door meeting. As co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Mark Weisbrot, explained in an article for the Huffington Post, Shannon had no obligatory duty to meet with Nunes but his doing so sent a clear message of at least tacit acceptance of the impeachment proceedings by the White House. U.S. support of the current coup echoes that of the previous Brazilian coup in 1964 a violent usurpation of power by U.S.-friendly dictator, during which Dilma Rousseff, herself, became a victim of physical torture. But perhaps the most telling indication of U.S. support for deposing Rousseff can be found in a detail of Nunes recent Washington trip. As the Intercepts Andrew Fishman explained in an interview with Democracy Now, Nunes was a guest at a private luncheon thrown by the Albright Stonebridge Group a firm co-founded by the former CEO of Kellogg and Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state under Bill Clinton. [O]ne of the senior advisers affiliated with the Albright Stonebridge Group, Fishman, who is located in Brazil, noted, is the leader of an organization down here thats very involved in the push against the Dilma government. He added that while the U.S. government hasnt made any official stance on Rousseffs impending impeachment, it seems pretty obvious as to what their stance is and which side theyre supporting or would support. Claire Bernish writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared. Another country, another hostile take-over. And on to the next one Obama is already preparing for riots. As are his handlers, in more ways than one! Bill Ayers, Obamas longtime good friend since his days as a young man, is the convicted Domestic Terrorist communist whose organization Underground Weather bombed the US State Department and a police officers home, among other targets. In sync with Soros, Ayers used social media to urge the US political left to disrupt Trump rallies. TPTB are stirring the pot attempting to get people fighting each other, as per usual Why are the Generals not REFUSING to obey CRIMINAL ORDERS? The US has no legitimate reason for entering Syria. ANY troops is a criminal invasion of a sovereign nation. And we all know Obama is heading the start of WWIII. Thats a fear tactic to force the people of the world to accept the NWO. A true WW3 would decimate the Globalists control and infrastructure. The Globalists have been playing this same tune since they created the Soviet Union, and then went on to bring Mao and the Chinese communists to power. Control with fear. pending approvalposting without a NY Times article link It seems disingenuous to suggest the ouster of Rousseff is entirely anti-democratic given reports by Brazilian activists, media, and fellow politicians of her arrogant, authoritarian style, breaking pledges, and refusal to meet with members of Brazils congress and others for 5 years among other problems. The Intercept is a suspicious source of information given billionaire founder Omidyar apparently supports the NSA and the Establishment. Also suspicious is Greenwald who stonewalled his reporting on the States Secrets Privilege cases being used against US govt (NSA, FBI) whistleblowers to silence them for reasons of national security as reported by S. Edmonds. Greenwald focused his reporting instead on suspected Islamic terrorists in the US which undermined public support for congressional oversight into abuse of the SSP program. There is some complex subterfuge in these reports as all of these media sources are designed to blow smoke. Yes, the US Elites instigate coups but not to target the BRICS who are puppeteered by the same Masters including BIS, IMF, UN World Bank. We will probably never know what the real dynamics are. The very fact that there is a symbol proves there is a reality. The fact of a shadow proves there must be a substance. Passionately devote yourself to the pursuit of Wisdom and obtain Knowledge. Love is a force more subtle than all Wisdom and more potent than life or eternity itself. the puppets and their mercenary forces march ever onward. And ordered by a tyrant whos goal is to enslave the world. The Chinese are never going to let America take over the influence in Brazil. One, Brazil is a Major player in BRICS Banking Cartel and two, the Chinese need all the iron-ore resources that Brazil has and third, the Chinese built a 2 Mile Long Pier off of Brazil just for their Cargo Ships! The Chinese have to much invested to let the US screw all this up. Thanks for removing all doubt! The CIA has long been in the business of destabilizing nations. This time the attack is against a BRICS country in a bid to protect the Western financial oligarchy. A similar attack is also being launched against South Africa. Can you point me to where Trump said he wants war with China please. As a well informed Brazillian as i consider myself about this matter, i have to first say this is a good an accurate article. We had to forgot the main media and feed ourselves from unconventional media cause people are being massivelly manipulated here. So we are a polarized country without the ability to talk the same language cause its like two groups living in total different countries, because of that misinformation. A lot of hate also, coming from a number of people who just cant swallow the arise of the poorest from 2002 until now. They where shy, but this political moment ended up to giving a loud voice to this kind of people. The US always had an eye on South America, but i think its becoming worse from the last few years, cause theyre managing to influence the most important governments at the same time, like they already have done in Venezuela, Argentina and now almost done in Brazil. Their interest in Brazil gone wild as the discovering of the Pre-sal, one of the biggest oil reserves of the world. Venezuela have an even large (a lot more) one. The political pressure here started (or got worse) when Rouseffs Gov didnt sold the Petrobras extraction rights. Im not talking about the US like the sole vulture, blaming a country to put mine as just a victim. No, we also have companies and people here working together, ravaging the country and probably working along with international interesting including US. This not to mention the sack of workers rigths thats going on in some European countries (France for sure), Argentina its happening now and here in Brazil were already aware about a lot of right losses that are going to be. Umm, you exceptionals do understand that its YOUR spawn and YOUR taxes being used by the Judas Class and their owners to shove Central Banks down the throats of every nation on the planet for their Bolshevik owners, right? (knocks on collective skulls, getting a hollow BONG-like sound in return). You DO understand the Judas Class in D.C. spends approaching 650 BILLIONS EACH AND EVERY YEAR to maintain +/- 800 combat-ready bases in over 125 nations to ensure any attempts by the indigenous people to BOOT OUT the Central Banks and their Bolshevik owners from within their appointed positions in government can be answered swiftly? (knocks on collective skulls, getting a hollow BONG-like sound in return..again). Might I assume you are further aware that the infrastructure of Sewer nation was rated D-MINUS in 2009 and yet we still funnel billions in gifts/contracts etc. to Israel while your fellow Christians/Muslims live in sewer systems and tent cities? (bitch slaps their collective faces in an apparently useless attempt to awaken them). Oops, sorry. I hadnt noticed your attention was being held by the latest stud in use by the Kardashians was discussing sports. My bad. ",0
"Summoned in an effort to enjoy a two-hour feature film, 33-year-old Geoffrey Spalding's willing suspension of disbelief reportedly went unrewarded Saturday. 'It wasn't easy, but I held up my end of the deal,' Spalding said of the mental effort he put forth to accept the invented premises of a fictional world and temporarily disregard their implausibility. 'What do I get in return? A thoughtful exploration of our inward nature transferred to an imaginative context? A semblance of truth confronted through a skillful narrative process? Nope, I don't get shit.' Spalding added that if he could be enraptured by a rat who aspires to be a chef and a man who ages backward, then being entertained by a young ballet dancer discovering her dark side should have been a breeze.

"A Brexit Lesson In Greek - Votes and Hopes Trashed on Parliamentary FloorsOp-Ed by Brett Redmayne-Titley Sadly, yours is an optimism without memory of corrupt Members of the European Parliament (MEP) or of EU evils past and their backroom methods of dealing with the whims of free will, voting power and democracy. You must realize that these are anathema to the tenants of centralized rule. Indeed. History is about to repeat itself less than a year later. Like the failures of Greece in June 2015, last weeks UK referendum is doomed. Three-hundred-and-sixty-one days before the Brexit victory night of this past Thursday, Alexis Tsipras boarded a plane to Brussels with a confident smile on his face and a new populist referendum under his arm. As head of Syriza, the fledgling opposition movement avowed to stop EU hegemony over a positive Greek financial future, Tsipras had roared to power. In an attempt to fulfill this promise he scheduled a referendum a non-binding popular vote requiring parliamentary approval refusing Troika financial demands of additional austerity that would further gut and sell-off his country to its core. Getting onto the plane Tsipras was all confident smiles and waves to his supporters. The world press was abuzz with the possibility of a Grexit from the EU. Ah, but what a difference two days in Brussels can make. He returned to Athens with the face of a broken man with a country more fractured than when he left just days before. Tsipras had failed. Miserably. His political ineptness directly caused, rather than cured the Greek problems. Moreover, it was his failure to understand and plan against the true collective influence and danger of his Brussels counterparts that puts the ongoing and ever-increasing social and economic Greek disaster squarely on his head. Simply put, Tsipras was an arrogant fool who attempted to play high-stakes EU political poker for the first time in his life at a poker table seated with career EU card sharks. Sadly, he was not merely a fool with little money he was a foolwith a country! Coincidentally, that was exactly the price the EU demanded; one whole country. Greece! And then, there was David Cameron. Days ago, Tuesday morning, Dec. 28, the same grim resignation of fate adorned the face of the UK Prime Minister as he left for the woodshed in Brussels. Like his Greek predecessor, Cameron had personally begun the process of consummating the destruction of the sovereignty of his country via his creation of the EU-serving Brexit referendum that would prove forever UK support for servitude to EU diktats. Obviously his attempt to please his masters did not go as planned. So, Cameron left this week to serve-up his ill-conceived Brexit to be carved into pieces for a plan of attack by a cabal of unelected corporate, Zionist banksters who wish to hold sway over all matters EU. Judging from their year-old Greek insurrection, they will know exactly what to do now. In the days and weeks to come the hope and vote in favor of sovereignty, via the Brexit, will be dashed forever on the rocks of EU treachery. Again. Pundits of the post-Brexit days show dumbfounded optimism. Again their predilection for short memories regarding past efforts of the nationalist movements to stand up to their EU masters is shown. Camerons political blow-up has accidentally set in place the populist sword of Damocles over the heads of this US-inspired EU central control. In doing so, the irrational optimism that was the Brexit cannon-shot just a week ago, does not foresee the roadblocks already forming behind the scenes that will NEVER allow a confirmation of this populist UK referendum. These optimists myopically ignore the very recent lessons of not very faraway Greece. The British have violated the rules, flatly stated EU parliamentarian, Martin Schulz as a warning. It is not the EU philosophy that the crowd can decide its fate. Here lies the problem. Jogging the memory banks, it must be recalled that it was only due to Camerons willingness to please Brussels that he allowed for the Brexit referendum to be conceived three years ago. Following the 2015 UK general election that saw Camerons Conservative Party seize power with a mysteriously low 24% of the popular vote, Tory arrogance was running wild and so Brexit was thus finally scheduled. This votes results were supposed to spell resounding allegiance by a majority of Britons to EU un-elected central control. But, the vote was following many draconian austerity ridden years imposed by the Cons at the behest of the EU committee which always had money for American-inspired war and its felonious banks but not a farthing for food or peace. All that was actually left for the UK voters financial future was the prospects of a massive, ongoing housing bubble inspired and created by Canadian draftee and UK co-conspirator, Mark Carney, whose Canadian version of this housing Ponzi scheme has already burst across Canada months ago. So, surprised they were in Brussels when this past Thursday, June 23, 2016 the whole plan blew up in their arrogant faces. None of the EU Commission dreamed this a possibility, nor the twenty-nine EU country leaders, nor the massive banking interests they all represent. But was not this the same short-lived surprise rendered in Greece? The Greek referendum was so short-lived and ultimately disastrous that it should be considered foreshadowing of the evil results and planning that will now, again, take place in the latest EU committee effort to thwart the free will of all UK and future EU voters. The wedge: the Brexit. As such, in the days to come the parliamentary efforts to ratify the Brexit, like the will of the Greek politicians before them, will become mere trash on a new parliamentary floor. To see clearly, take a look at what the first six days after the anxiously awaited Brexit results has achieved for the public so far. EU President, Jean-Claude Juncker, immediately began huffing, puffing and bluffing. Responding to applause from the UK contingent on his opening Brexit remarks at the first EU commission meeting, he diverted from his prepared script, warning the Britons, thats the last time you are applauding here and to some extent Im really surprised you are here. You are fighting for the exit. The British people voted in favor of the exit. Why are you here? Indeed Junckers morning outburst at the first post-Brexit EU committee meeting showed his dictatorial nature and inherent contempt for all EU democracy and that of Britain. This of course highlighted collective EU contempt for national sovereignty or populist will of EU voters, and the core reason why so many Brits had chosen to give him the middle finger just days before. This was supported by the grinning Nigel Farage, who could not miss this new dawn of the EU world. When it was his turn to speak he mocked Juncker and the other jeering EU dual-loyalists.Youre not laughing now are you! he crowed.and the reason youre so upset, the reason youre so angry, the reason youre not laughing is simple you as a political project are in denial. Indeed. Following Fridays opening salvo Cameron resigned, which was not surprising, but the timing of his swoon should have been. While many saw this as the Prime Minister properly falling on his sword, none commented on the true result applied to the Brexit. While his departure should be Boris Johnsons dream come true, Camerons resignation immediately put any parliamentary ratification of the Brexit on indefinite hold pending election of his successor. Nice. With Cameron now very publicly whining about his inabilities to lead a Brexit transition, he has punted the EUs problems while leaving the ball in the air. In serious political matters of state and high finance, when the shit-hits-the-fan the best historical legislative option is: delay. Hence, Cameron has currently stopped the time clock of Brexit passage. But the game continues behind-the-scenes despite the timeout. Its a safe bet that the phones of many UK parliamentarians are ringing right now with incoming calls from Belgium. It will not take too many successful calls for the Brexit to become as once was the Grexit. Brexit was passed by a thin margin of the popular vote. Not all UK districts collectively voted to leave EU control. Nor did Scotland or Ireland. Wales, however, wants out. The votes to be cast by elected members in the House of Commons are representative of the collective will of their districts or voting areas. Will Members of Parliament (MPs)vote as per their districts will? While this is still a resounding majority, Scotland and Ireland who hold a collective sixty seats have come out strongly and nationally against it. The annals of worldwide political treachery and hypocrisy being equal in Westminster, it will not take much with a little economic hardship added in for enough votes and souls to be sold for money and a NO vote. Think not? Ask the Greeks. In a matter of mere days with an urgency created by Troika blackmail their referendum victory collapsed in public tatters on their own parliaments floor. The vote of their people meant nothing. Despite the possibility of a NO vote in the Commons, it is the House of Lords that is most in the grasp of EU control. Unelected and already wealthy from inherited riches, the Landed Gentry of Britain has much to lose from a Brexit passage. Although the house of Lords does not have a process by which it can vote NO, it does have the ability to influence the Commons as was shown during the two-year negotiations for the language of the Brexit where Lords returned the drafts for revisions on numerous occasions and Commons complied. However, parliamentary approval of any legislation originating in the Commons can be, by law, delayed for up to two parliamentary terms by the Lords. It should be remembered that in the weeks leading up to last Thursdays earthquake the majority of gloom and doom financial reasons to stay emanated from politicians in tails and their vicarious political concubines, such as rock musics prince of whores, U2s Bono. Will the rich of Britain, after gaining so much from EU complicity, work against their own best interests? Probably not. If the House of Lords delays a vote on confirmation for two full terms, whats an already angry Britain to do about it? Forces unknown next floated the short-lived idea of a new referendum to deny the results of the first one. While this was revealed initially to be a fraudulent effort inspired by third world countries, the effort to re-vote has subsequently caught fire and highlights the desperation of Brussels to divide and conquer by tightening the closeness of the two opinions on the previous results. But no sane politician even David Cameron was going to fall for that one again; so, while it wont fly, watch as the new daily results are used to negate and minimize the true referendum tally. At the first EU commission meeting since the Brexit, again the EU leadership blathered about the UK getting out as soon as possible. Indeed this belied their backstage agenda and their own EU charter. This contains the next big problem for Brexit supporters: Article 50. Mr. Junker ignores his own craftsmanship when ushering the UK out the door at his personal behest. Article 50 was included in case of the eventuality of a member nation-state leaving. It is very ill-defined. Article 50 allows for as much as two years for the transition to take place and leaves it up to the member country, the UK, to decide when to implement by formal notification the commencement of Article 50. Despite the Brexit vote, Britain is under no obligation to do so at any prescribed time. The press has incorrectly stated that Article 50 allows for member states to individually veto a countrys departure. This is not true, but the reality is actually far worse. Once Article 50 is commenced by the UKs formal notification to the EU, thus begins a never-before-tried process of negotiations regarding the terms under which the UK will leave. With thousands of pages of existing UK and EU laws that must be considered and amended retroactively, as well as trade agreements and worldwide foreign policy commitments, Article 50 allows for a mere two years from commencement to fruition. All along the way these negotiations will be joined by all twenty-eight other members of the EU contingent who will be looking for compromise. For a country with the worlds second biggest banking center this will certainly be a daunting task. It will also be extraordinarily divisive while creating a public and daily confrontation as the UK attempts to finalize the terms of its departure against the collective will of its adversaries. Ultimately, it is the member states who do have de facto and lengthy veto power during the negotiated term. Until these countries approve the terms, conditions and revisions the UK, despite its Brexit vote, is going nowhere. Conspicuously Ireland, and hypocritically Scotland, have both brandished their claim to a unilateral veto as their new weapon against the Brexit. Not true, but their influence in the exit negotiations, like that of the other member nations, may have that exact same effect. This opposition has all occurred in a mere six days just four business days. Markets and banking stocks were down in historic one-day drops. The British pound is bouncing near thirty-year low levels. By manufacturing additional reasons to stop the Brexit as was done in Greece economic forces are already bringing to bear supposed economic hardships on Britain as punishment. At this point the very long list of admitted market manipulations by UK and EU banks must be recalled to attention. Although the EU used an economic gun in the form of loans to then be used primarily for compulsory payback of previous IMF loans to which Tsipras fiddled this brought Greece to its knees quickly. Now it seems the EU is focused on the devaluation of the Pound which, if effective, will cause an already impoverished Britain to suffer inflation and increased cost for essential consumer goods. This will create social discontent and insurrection against the perceived cause, which will surely be trumpeted by media whores as being the fault of the Brexit. This worked quickly and to perfection in Greece. If this example does not suffice see: Daniel Ortega/Nicaragua. Strangely, the post-Brexit UK now worries about exports, national exports that have already been sharply reduced by EU mandated sanctions at the behest of their American masters against exporting to the largest importer in Europe: Russia. Pundits cite oil exports as example, to which one might ask: if ISIS can sell its stolen oil via Turkey and right under the EUs and NATOs watchful eye, then why not Britain and Scotland? Someones buying. Final proof that the Brexit will go the way of the Dodo was shown in convincing fashion yesterday business day four, Thursday. Boris Johnson resigned. Really! His interest in becoming the new Tory Prime Minister has suddenly and dramatically diminished. This is a surprise equal to the Brexit results. Johnsons announcement is nothing more that political damage control in advance! Johnson has proven to be a political opportunist of the highest order during his multi-year political legacy of grandstanding on issues he can use to advantage. Few recall that Mr. Johnson, as a Conservative Party leader, was not until recently at all in favor of the Brexit. Then he flip-flopped in the final months. He was rewarded with huge press coverage. In the days before the vote his Trump-like image adorned many a national rags cover page. With Camerons fortunes those of one who is sent to the Tower, everyone, especially Johnson, knew his next step: No.10. So, six days later he punts?! Johnsons no fool. His political cunning in using the Brexit has led him to front-runner status. He plans to stay there. He knows that whoever replaces Cameron inherits the Brexit pro-and-con. Moreover, Johnson well understands the upcoming protracted mess it will be. With the volatility of British parliamentary politics often historically providing for a very truncated tenancy at Downing St., Johnson is not going to throw a decade of dedicated opportunism away in favor of surefire failure. The UK economy may rise from the ashes of the Brexit. He cannot. The world needs change and more than ever it needs hope. In watching these dreams destroyed by a meanness only central in the hearts of so few, there is no joy. The Brexit, regardless of the multi-layered arguments for staying or leaving, offered both. When the Brexit fails to come to fruition, several years from now, this will serve as another warning of the power of the organizations that exert their will over that of nations and the rights of man. When the dust that was the idiocy of Greeces Alexis Tsipras and his quixotic joist with power had settled, barely one year ago, only one shred of good came of it: a sound warning. A realization that we, those who still desire the change and hope of a better beginning, are playing a very terminal end game and we better learn the rules! Here, the Brexit will fail miserably. Here, however, lies a lesson. When next a nation chooses to sit at the high-stakes poker table that seats the players of its own sovereign demise; this time remember Greece. This time, remember what once was the optimism of the Brexit. This time play to win! -THE END- Image Credit: Alt-Market.com About The Author: Brett Redmayne-Titley began reporting on-scene in an effort to provide better quality reporting from current events of geo-political, environmental and moral importance.

"Engineers investigating the explosion of one of SpaceXâ€™s rockets in September have figured out what went wrong, and launches could resume in mid-December, Elon Musk, the companyâ€™s chief executive, said on Friday.â€œI think weâ€™ve gotten to the bottom of the problem,â€ Mr. Musk said during an interview on CNBCâ€™s Squawk Box program. â€œReally surprising problem thatâ€™s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry.â€Mr. Musk described it as the toughest puzzle solved that the company has ever had to solve.The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed the Falcon 9 rocket as well as a $200 million satellite was perplexing because it occurred before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. The actual launch was scheduled for two days later.The accident has complicated NASAâ€™s operations with the International Space Station. SpaceX is one of two companies ferrying cargo to the space mission. SpaceXâ€™s next flight had been scheduled to launch this month but is postponed indefinitely.On Friday, NASA juggled its order for the next flight from the other company, Orbital ATK of Dulles, Va., switching to a larger rocket that would allow additional cargo. That launch is scheduled for the spring.SpaceX also has a NASA contract to carry astronauts to the space station beginning as early as late next year.Mr. Musk indicated on Friday that the problem occurred during fueling. As liquid oxygen flowed into a tank on the second stage, the propellant was so cold that it froze solid, setting off a domino effect that destroyed the rocket in a succession of fireballs on the launchpad. At normal atmospheric pressures, oxygen turns solid at -362 degrees Fahrenheit.Last week, SpaceX released a statement that it was focusing the investigation on one of three helium containers within the oxygen tank. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated up and released to maintain pressure within the tank. The company said that its tests had replicated the rupture of the helium containers, made of carbon fiber composite materials.â€œIt basically involves a combination of liquid helium, advanced carbon fiber composites and solid oxygen,â€ Mr. Musk said. â€œOxygen so cold that it actually enters solid phase.â€Mr. Musk did not provide other details about how solid oxygen affected the carbon fiber composites.In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at -340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used for rocket propulsion. The lower temperatures make the oxygen denser and improve engine thrust, SpaceX has said.If the helium were in a liquid state, it would be even colder (-452 degrees), and that appears to have provided unintended additional cooling that turned some of the oxygen solid.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that hazards could be greater for future astronauts riding on SpaceX rockets. With supercooled fuel, the launch occurs soon after the fuel is pumped into the rocket. SpaceX has proposed that the astronauts would be strapped in before fueling begins instead of boarding after fueling.In a letter last December, a space station advisory committee headed by retired Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford of the Air Force strongly and unanimously objected to that idea, saying it was â€œcontrary to booster safety criteria that has been in place for over 50 years, both in this country and internationally.â€SpaceX officials have suggested that a change of procedure would prevent a recurrence, and the rocketâ€™s launch abort system would have carried the astronauts to safety in case of an emergency.When SpaceX resumes launching, the first flight will be for one of its commercial customers, but company officials have not said where the next launch will occur. The accident damaged the Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that SpaceX has used for almost all of its Falcon 9 launches so far.SpaceX has also been renovating Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches, and it also has a launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.For NASA, the space station is not running short of supplies. But Orbital ATK is recovering from its own mishap, when an Antares rocket with NASA cargo exploded two years ago. It then launched two of its Cygnus cargo ships on a competitorâ€™s rocket, the Atlas 5 built by United Launch Alliance, and last month, it launched with a redesigned Antares.Russian and Japanese cargo ships are scheduled to head to the station before the end of the year.Frank DeMauro, the vice president of Orbital ATKâ€™s advanced programs division, said that a couple of months ago, NASA officials began discussions to launch the next cargo flight with an Atlas 5 instead of an Antares rocket. That would increase the cargo capacity by about 660 pounds.Mr. DeMauro said that an Atlas, which has a track record of more than 60 successful launches, would decrease the chances of delays. â€œIt highlights our focus on supporting our customer even if it means launching on another companyâ€™s rocket,â€ he said.",1
"WASHINGTON â€” For most of the last 70 years, the United States, Canada and much of Europe have constituted a vast zone of peace, prosperity and democracy. The trans-Atlantic community has grown to over 900 million inhabitants of more than 30 countries. It has set an example for regional cooperation in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, and served as a mainstay of the liberal world order.That achievement is in jeopardy. The bonds within Europe have been fraying for some time, but this year has been the worst yet. Last month, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Unionâ€™s highest official, said that the union faced â€œan existential crisis.â€Meanwhile, Americaâ€™s two major parties have soured on trade agreements with Europe and Asia. Donald J. Trump has welcomed Britainâ€™s decision to leave the European Union, derided American allies and hailed an authoritarian leader, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who fears and tries to undermine Western solidarity.Given these pressures, the year ahead may determine whether the West can overcome its current troubles. A vital lesson of the modern era is that internationalism has stabilized the world, while lapses into bellicose nationalism have wreaked havoc.The aftermath of World War I was a series of follies and failures: the Carthaginian peace of Versailles, the ineptitude of the League of Nations, the Great Depression and the emergence of totalitarianism. Together, they made a second conflagration all but inevitable.The victors of World War II determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. They found in the history of Western civilization the precepts for a community of nations buttressed not only by shared values, interests and institutions, but also by the worldâ€™s most powerful military alliance. They had much to draw on: Periclesâ€™ ideal polity (â€œnot the few but the many governâ€), the Hanseatic League (a trade and defense pact in the Middle Ages), the Age of Reason, Adam Smithâ€™s advocacy of open markets and the division of labor to enhance the wealth of nations, and Immanuel Kantâ€™s conviction that â€œperpetual peaceâ€ depended on democratic nationsâ€™ conducting vigorous commerce.The first step toward a united Europe was a common market for coal and steel. France and Germany, enemies in both world wars, became partners in peacetime industry and trade. The architects of the European Project, subscribing to a binding ethos of Atlanticism, were inspired by Americaâ€™s success in molding the newly independent states from the original 13 colonies into â€œa more perfect union.â€ Europeâ€™s progress in that direction would never have been possible without the Marshall Plan, which jump-started the Continentâ€™s postwar economic recovery and ensured 42 years of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a shield against the Soviet Union.The collapse of that faltering superpower in 1991 spurred the evolution of the European Economic Community into the European Union. NATOâ€™s decision to accept new members that had been Soviet satellites and republics made it possible for the European Union to do the same.Throughout, the byword was integration: a steady process of harmonizing the policies of individual nation-states into common European ones, making collaboration easier and interdependence beneficial for all.In the 1970s, before the term became pejorative, â€œEurocratsâ€ in Brussels took pride in being at the vanguard of a worldwide trend for which they popularized a little-used word: globalization. By most accounts, the opening of markets significantly narrowed the inequality between rich and poor regions of the world, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, especially in Asia. The downside of globalization in developed regions, especially in North America and Europe â€” depressed wages and jobs at risk in industries exposed to foreign competition â€” seemed manageable as long as the world economy was humming.Through the 1990s, for the most part, economies continued to grow, median incomes climbed, jobs were plentiful and markets signaled a bright future. In 2007, the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record high. A year later, the euro reached its maximum value against the dollar. But within a few months, Americaâ€™s banking and housing sectors had crashed, prompting the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Close to nine million Americans lost their jobs and a similar number of homeowners were forced into foreclosures, surrenders of their homes or distress sales. The decline in national wealth hit the poor and middle class hardest.The Great Recession was worse for Europe. Trade with the rest of the world slumped and employment shrank, especially along the Mediterranean rim. The economic crisis exposed and exacerbated structural flaws in the European Union itself. Even in the good times, there had been tensions between debtor and creditor member states. The common currency, the euro, imposed a common monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate, but without fiscal integration among countries. That defect has hobbled Europeâ€™s response to the sovereign debt crises and caused precipitous drops in employment.The last year has seen one catastrophe after another. A rash of terrorist attacks has heightened security concerns; Britainâ€™s decision to leave the union has raised fears of a contagion of other â€œexitsâ€; and an influx of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa has placed burdens on labor markets, stressed social services and inflamed public anxieties.The election campaign in the United States has revealed a similar malaise. Many Americans, especially in rural and blue-collar areas, are pessimistic about the future and nostalgic for a seemingly better past. As in Europe, there is widespread mistrust of elites and experts, and feverish enthusiasm for anti-establishment populists.With this backlash comes the threat of protectionism in economics, isolationism in foreign policy, and a resurgent nativism and xenophobia in politics â€” precisely the toxic mix that the North American and European visionaries of Atlanticism sought to prevent when they laid its foundations.Fortunately, stewards of that legacy remain in power in most Western capitals. And many citizens of European Union countries, especially the younger generations, tend to identify as Europeans, whatever their nationality. Despite Brexit, this is still true of many Britons.That still leaves Europeâ€™s elected officials with an onerous task. They must convince majorities of their citizens that 27 member states can better protect them within the European Union than without it.To do so, the unionâ€™s institutions need to streamline decision-making while improving cooperation. In particular, they must prove effective in thwarting terrorists, whether they are infiltrators from the Middle East or homegrown. The attacks perpetrated this year by European citizens underscore the need for a long-term strategy to tackle alienation and radicalization within Europeâ€™s Muslim communities.That talismanic Euro-word, integration, finds new relevance: Instead of segregating migrants and asylum seekers in enclaves like those in inner-city Brussels or among the banlieues of Paris, several European municipalities are exploring ways to accelerate the process of assimilation by providing low-cost housing, education and job training. Starting and funding such programs would be challenging under normal circumstances, but the difficulties are especially acute now, when virtually all Western European governments are on the defensive and several face daunting electoral challenges from nationalist opponents in the year ahead.Mr. Putin has all too successfully stoked the sense of peril and fear of failure in the West. The Kremlin is backing insurgent euroskeptic parties, bullying Russiaâ€™s neighbors and trying to undo sanctions imposed after its illegal annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. Against such subversion, the NATO alliance needs beefing up to help prevent Europeâ€™s political disintegration â€” and this must be a major priority for any incoming United States administration.The next president will have domestic challenges as well, given the gridlock between the executive and legislative branches, and an inward turn in the public mood. The current polarizing and dispiriting presidential campaign may also cast a pall over the future.These handicaps make it even more important for Western governments to address their citizensâ€™ legitimate concerns about the impact of globalization. They must work to cement a new political consensus that will restore public support for free and fair international trade. Persuading the newly industrialized nations with export-based economies to adopt better labor practices and environmental policies, and to respect human rights, is not enough. There will have to be remedial action at home. Vulnerable workers in developed nations deserve better safety nets, as well as ambitious and effective retraining opportunities in growing sectors of economy.Citizensâ€™ sense that the system is unfair needs addressing, too. Big business is ripe for reform. Newcomers to the marketplace should have a better chance in markets that are now dominated by mega-monopolies. American-based corporations should not be able to exploit tax rules that allow them to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions.For globalization to be politically sustainable, it must be more economically equitable. Measures like these would begin to persuade a critical mass of people at global, regional and national levels that they, too, can share in a new wave of prosperity.Restoring social progress on this scale will succeed only if it has buy-in from all segments of society. But the innovation and direction must come from the top. In enlisting their constituentsâ€™ support for a renewed commitment to Atlanticism, this generation of Western leaders faces the greatest and most consequential test in 70 years.",1
"Extreme Levels Of Herbicide Roundup Found In FoodEmily Cassidy The study, coming out in Junes issue of Food Chemistry and available online, looked at 31 different soybean plants on Iowa farms and compared the accumulation of pesticides and herbicides on plants in three categories 1) genetically engineered Roundup Ready soy, 2) conventionally produced (not GE) soy, and 3) soy cultivated using organic practices. They found high levels of Roundup on 70 percent of genetically engineered soy plants. Crop scientists have genetically engineered soy to survive blasts of Roundup so farmers can spray this chemical near crops to get rid of weeds. But some so-called super weeds resistant to Roundup have developed. In turn, some farmers use yet more Roundup to try to kill those hardy weeds. This leads to more Roundup chemicals being found on soybeans and ultimately in the food supply. Who says when Roundup contamination can be considered extreme? Monsanto itself. In 1999, the chemical giant defined an extreme level of the herbicide as 5.6 milligrams per kilogram of plant weight. This study demonstrated that Roundup Ready [GE]-soy may have high residue levels of glyphosate and also that different agricultural practices may result in a markedly different nutritional composition of soybeans . Lack of data on pesticide residues in major crop plants is a serious gap of knowledge with potential consequences for human and animal health. Other research has detected Roundup residues in animals and people. A study led by German researchers found high concentrations of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, in the urine of dairy cows and humans. This study, published last January in the journal Environmental Analytical Toxicology, concluded that the presence of glyphosate residues in both humans and animals could haul the entire population towards numerous health hazards. Big Ag wants us to believe that there is no difference between GE and conventional crops, but mounting research tells us that just isnt true. Emily Cassidy is a biofuels research analyst for the Environmental Working Group where this report first appeared. ",0
"So Heathrowâ€™s good for business (Report, 26 October)? Heathrow Airport Holdings is owned by FGP TopCo, an international consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish Company based in Madrid, in partnership with Qatar Holdings, Caisse de Depot du Quebec, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and the China Investment Corporation, among others. Heathrow Holdings has previously admitted it makes more from being a shopping mall than from the flying business and now the taxpayer is likely to be told to stump up Â£5bn-Â£10bn for added road and rail infrastructure, according to former transport minister Stephen Hammond. And thatâ€™s before the crucial debate on pollution and health. Heathrow has never taken responsibility for the dangerous pollution caused by the stacking of aircraft waiting to land and anxious to shed surplus fuel over hapless residents below. Heathrow must come clean; this whole affair is a dirty business.Anna FordLondon â€¢ Your editorial (26 October) has it right: so long as the mania for economic growth possesses us, terrible decisions â€“ such as that to expand Heathrow â€“ will go on being made. Is it not, therefore, time to draw the logical conclusion: that our society needs finally to put into question the logic of such growth? Letâ€™s give it up â€“ and substitute the goal of actually making our lives better instead. Dr Rupert ReadChair of Green House and co-author, The Post-growth Project â€¢ Unless fail criteria are published in advance of the public consultation on the third runway at Heathrow, it can only be a waste of time and money. Just what would those being consulted be required to demonstrate to halt this development? Is there any independent authority whose opinion could conceivably change their minds? If the government has already made up its mind then why not go ahead and build it right now?Dr Richard TurnerHarrogate, North Yorkshire â€¢ So the transport secretary suggests the runway could be put on a ramp over the M25, which would be cheaper and quicker than a tunnel. But arenâ€™t there even cheaper options? How about traffic lights or a roundabout? Or, cheapest of all, perhaps, a zebra crossing, so that road vehicles pull up when they see a plane waiting to cross.Richard NormanCanterbury, Kent â€¢ Far from demolishing hundreds of homes to build a new runway, we could be demolishing redundant airports to build new homes. Northolt is a complete, but scandalously underused airport just five miles from Heathrow; it could easily become a Terminal 6 for non-hub and domestic traffic. Only just outside the M25 lies Farnborough, another fully operational airport working at a fraction of its capacity. And just a little further out, Greenham Common has a runway big enough to be an emergency landing site for the space shuttle, and it is now completely unused. Martin LysterOxford â€¢ Tony Hodbod (Letters, 26 October), in proposing Thorne Waste for an English national airport, must be unaware that it is a nationally important nature reserve. But of course, it is far more important that we increase our greenhouse gas emissions rather than protect the environment.Catherine GoundryRetford, Nottinghamshire â€¢ Manchester Airport with two runways and excess capacity is the third largest airport in Britain and is far more central to Britain. Living only 10 minutes from this international airport, I resent having to go to Heathrow to access direct flights to some parts of the world. Perhaps the investment in Heathrow could be redirected to encouraging British Airways to use Manchester as a hub, as it once didhelping to rebalance the economy.Moira SykesManchester â€¢ Join the debate â€“ email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",1
"Stan Rosenfield, who represents Sheen, declined to answer any other questions about the actor's case. Sheen, whose real name is Carlos Irwin Estevez, was arrested Christmas Day on suspicion of second-degree assault, menacing and criminal mischief and released on $8,500 bond, according to police. Rosenfield issued the following statement after Sheen's arrest: 'Do not be misled by appearance. Appearance and reality can be as different as night and day. It would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion.' Sheen has previously pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of battery with serious bodily injury for a 1996 incident involving his then-girlfriend, Brittany Ashland. He was accused of knocking her to the floor, leaving her bloodied and briefly unconscious. He was then sentenced to two years probation with a suspended one-year jail term and 300 hours of community service. At his sentencing, he told a judge: 'I feel this is very fair, and I'm grateful. ... You will not see me back in this courtroom.' ",1
"CHICAGOLeo Burnett Agency creative executive Patrick Bergman authorized the use of a common proverb in a Subway ad campaign in spite of the fact that the phrase's true meaning undermines the intent of the ad, the 41-year-old reported Monday. 'The ad slogan 'Who says there's no such thing as a free lunch?' was perfect for Subway's free-sandwich giveaway,' Bergman said. 'Who cares if, technically, the customer had to buy 12 sandwiches to get one free? People know the phrase, and they respond to it.' Bergman last misused a proverb two weeks ago, when he put 'haste makes waste' in an ad encouraging people to hurry to a 12-hour Macy's white sale. ",0

"Global Police, Precrime and the War on Domestic ExtremistsBy John Whitehead As such, you are now viewed as a greater threat to America than ISIS or al Qaeda. Let that sink in a moment. If you believe in and exercise your rights under the Constitution (namely, your right to speak freely, worship freely, associate with like-minded individuals who share your political views, criticize the government, own a weapon, demand a warrant before being questioned or searched, or any other activity viewed as potentially anti-government, racist, bigoted, anarchic or sovereign), you have just been promoted to the top of the governments terrorism watch list. I assure you Im not making this stuff up. Police agencies now believe the main terrorist threat in the United States is not from violent Muslim extremists, but from right-wing extremists. A New York Times editorial backs up these findings: Law enforcement agencies around the country are training their officers to recognize signs of anti-government extremism and to exercise caution during routine traffic stops, criminal investigations and other interactions with potential extremists. The threat is real, says the handout from one training program sponsored by the Department of Justice. Since 2000, the handout notes, 25 law enforcement officers have been killed by right-wing extremists, who share a fear that government will confiscate firearms and a belief in the approaching collapse of government and the economy. So what is the government doing about these so-called terrorists? The government is going to war. Again. Only this time, it has declared war against so-called American extremists. After decades spent waging costly, deadly and ineffective military campaigns overseas in pursuit of elusive ISIS and al Qaeda operatives and terror cells (including the recent accidental bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan that left 22 patients and medical staff dead), the Obama administration has announced a campaign to focus its terror-fighting forces inwards. Under the guise of fighting violent extremism in all of its forms and manifestations in cities and communities across the world, the Obama administration has agreed to partner with the United Nations to take part in its Strong Cities Network program. Funded by the State Department through 2016, after which charities are expected to take over funding, the cities included in the global network include New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Minneapolis, Paris, London, Montreal, Beirut and Oslo. Working with the UN, the federal government will train local police agencies across America in how to identify, fight and prevent extremism, as well as address intolerance within their communities, using all of the resources at their disposal. What this program is really all about, however, is community policing on a global scale. Community policing, which relies on a broken windows theory of policing, calls for police to engage with the communityin order to prevent local crime by interrupting or preventing minor offenses before they could snowball into bigger, more serious and perhaps violent crime. The problem with the broken windows approach is that it has led to zero tolerance policing and stop-and-frisk practices among other harsh police tactics. When applied to the Strong Cities Network program, the objective is ostensibly to prevent violent extremism by targeting its source: racism, bigotry, hatred, intolerance, etc. In other words, policeacting ostensibly as extensions of the United Nationswill identify, monitor and deter individuals who exhibit, express or engage in anything that could be construed as extremist. Consider how Attorney General Loretta Lynch describes the initiative: As residents and experts in their communities, local leaders are often best positioned to pinpoint sources of unrest and discord; best equipped to identify signs of potential danger; and best able to recognize and accommodate community cultures, traditions, sensitivities, and customs. By creating a series of partnerships that draws on the knowledge and expertise of our local officials, we can create a more effective response to this virulent threat. Translation: U.S. police agencies are embarking on an effort to identify and manage potential extremist threats, violent or otherwise, before they can become actual threats. (If you want a foretaste of how extreme things could get in the U.S.: new anti-terrorism measures in the U.K. require that extremists be treated like pedophiles and banned from working with youngsters and vulnerable people.) The governments war on extremists, of which the Strong Cities program is a part, is being sold to Americans in much the same way that the USA Patriot Act was sold to Americans: as a means of combatting terrorists who seek to destroy America. For instance, making the case for the governments war on domestic extremism, the Obama administration has suggested that it may require greater legal powers to combat violent attacks by lone wolves (such as people motivated by racial and religious hatred and anti-government views who communicate their hatred over the Internet and through social media). Enter the governments newest employee: a domestic terrorism czar. However, as we now know, the USA Patriot Act was used as a front to advance the surveillance state, allowing the government to establish a far-reaching domestic spying program that has turned every American citizen into a criminal suspect. Similarly, the concern with the governments anti-extremism program is that it will, in many cases, be utilized to render otherwise lawful, nonviolent activities as potentially extremist. Keep in mind that the government agencies involved in ferreting out American extremists will carry out their objectivesto identify and deter potential extremistsin concert with fusion centers (of which there are 78 nationwide, with partners in the private sector and globally), data collection agencies, behavioral scientists, corporations, social media, and community organizers and by relying on cutting-edge technology for surveillance, facial recognition, predictive policing, biometrics, and behavioral epigenetics (in which life experiences alter ones genetic makeup). This is pre-crime on an ideological scale and its been a long time coming. For example, in 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released two reports, one on Rightwing Extremism, which broadly defines rightwing extremists as individuals and groups that are mainly antigovernment, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely, and one on Leftwing Extremism, which labeled environmental and animal rights activist groups as extremists. Incredibly, both reports use the words terrorist and extremist interchangeably. That same year, the DHS launched Operation Vigilant Eagle, which calls for surveillance of military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, characterizing them as extremists and potential domestic terrorist threats because they may be disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from the psychological effects of war. These reports indicate that for the government, anyone seen as opposing the governmentwhether theyre Left, Right or somewhere in betweencan be labeled an extremist. Fast forward a few years, and you have the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which President Obama has continually re-upped, that allows the military to take you out of your home, lock you up with no access to friends, family or the courts if youre seen as an extremist. Now connect the dots, from the 2009 Extremism reports to the NDAA and the UNs Strong Cities Network with its globalized police forces, the National Security Agencys far-reaching surveillance networks, and fusion centers that collect and share surveillance data between local, state and federal police agencies. Add in tens of thousands of armed, surveillance drones that will soon blanket American skies, facial recognition technology that will identify and track you wherever you go and whatever you do. And then to complete the circle, toss in the real-time crime centers being deployed in cities across the country, which will be attempting to predict crimes and identify criminals before they happen based on widespread surveillance, complex mathematical algorithms and prognostication programs. Hopefully youre getting the picture, which is how easy it is for the government to identify, label and target individuals as extremist. Were living in a scary world. Unless we can put the brakes on this dramatic expansion and globalization of the governments powers, were not going to recognize this country 20 years from now. Frankly, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the landscape has already shifted dramatically from what it was like 10 or 20 years ago. Its taken less than a generation for our freedoms to be eroded and the police state structure to be erected, expanded and entrenched. Rest assured that the government will not save us from the chains of the police state. The UNs Strong Cities Network program will not save us. The next occupant of the White House will not save us. For that matter, anarchy and violent revolution will not save us. If there is to be any hope of freeing ourselves, it restsas it always hasat the local level, with you and your fellow citizens taking part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level. Attend local city council meetings, speak up at town hall meetings, organize protests and letter-writing campaigns, employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, which Martin Luther King Jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches. And then, while youre at it, urge your local governments to nullify everything the federal government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. If this sounds anti-government or extremist, perhaps it is, in much the same way that King himself was considered anti-government and extremist. Recognizing that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed, Kings tacticswhile nonviolentwere extreme by the standards of his day. As King noted in his 1963 Letter from Birmingham City Jail: [A]s I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist. Was not Jesus an extremist in loveLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you. Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremistThis nation cannot survive half slave and half free. Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremistWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. So the question is not whether we will be extremist but what kind of extremist will we be. Will we be extremists for hate or will we be extremists for love? So how do you not only push back against the police states bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means? Take a cue from King. Constitutional attorney and author John W. Whitehead is founder and president of The Rutherford Institute, where this article first appeared. He is the author of A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State. Whitehead does some great work, his organization, something of a small conservative ACLU, represented Brandon Raub, the US soldier hauled in by US military Gestapo for questioning and a psychiatric hold for Facebook posts critical of the US government. When interviewed about Raub, Whitehead said he didnt agree with Raub (e.g. about 9/11 being a false flag) but he believes Raub has the Constitutional right to free speech. Too bad Whitehead never publicly questioned the official story of 9/11 given it is the rationalization for the Patriot Act, NDAA, surveillance state, etc. The official federal government story does not matter one bit. If not 9/11, they would have just found another justification for imposing their tyranny. 9/11 catalyzed a steep learning curve for many. It isnt enough to know the history of false flags, thats only the beginning of a larger paradigm shift. A similar shift occurred during the era of Vietnam war protests. I have to be honestI thought Iwas describing Jon Rappoport I commented on the wrong article (lol)my mistakebut you inadvertently corrected me as I dont know anything about Whiteheadglad I didnt step in it(lol)but honesty is a big player in the golden rule society I want to live in cheers We are running out of time. If we can network to educate locally thats great. A national awakening (and global) must take place as well. Getting us to compartmentalize and relinquish a vision of national and state sovereignty is walking into a trap. The immigration reform GATEKEEPERS told their followers 12 years ago to focus their energy not on screening out open borders congressional representatives (and concomitantly educating the nation as a whole on deep state issues), but rather to focus on local initiatives. The latter consumed much time and energy resulting in NO changes because the rigged judicial system overturned prevailing initiatives resulting in a sense of helplessness as it was designed to do and to buy more time. Be wary, localism has a place in a free society yet it can just as easily serve the Agenda 21 model of control. Localism infiltrated by a George Soros funded NGO called Common Purpose (what they call it in the UK) like peppering a gold mine with a shotgun) that insidiously surreptitiously infiltrates all the nexus positions of power within local govnt bureaucracies.. the 1st thing they do is to introduce Politically Correct versions of their NGO reality-speaklook up Julia Middleton Common Purpose UKit will explain the pit of vipers mandatecheers basically promoting the state absorbing of our children in line with the edicts secreted in Agenda 21 a UN mandate to empty the rural sequester people into the cities .. extrapolated means lining up for 10 blocks everyday to get your allotted portion of Soylent Green -compulsory vaccines.

"According to a report released Monday by the U.S. Department of Labor, skyrocketing consumer prices coupled with stagnant wages have forced many Americans to work a fourth shift in another dimension in order to make ends meet. The extra-dimensional shift, which occurs on a time axis at right angles to that of normal reality, allows American workers to supplement their incomes, while still maintaining the morning, afternoon, and overnight shifts they need in order to stave off bankruptcy. 'The maximum 24 hours of possible work time offered by our plane of existence is simply not enough to provide a living wage in the current economic climate,' Labor Secretary Elaine Chao wrote in a letter introducing the report. 'These difficult circumstances have compelled 76 percent of the American workforce to seek additional hours in an alternate space-time dimension, where more competitive pay can help them to avoid years of crippling debt.' Many cash-strapped citizens such as Glenn Vernacini, a master welder at the GE aviation plant in Evendale, OH, have welcomed the opportunity to pad their income by working extra shifts in lateral time, only to return at the exact same moment they left. Vernacini, however, admitted that his regular trips to the alternate universe have taken their toll. 'It's hard, but what other option do I have?' Vernacini said. 'Having every atom in my body split and retranslated into a different form of matter just to make a few extra bucks isn't exactly my idea of fun, but my family needs to eat.' 'I age an extra eight hours every time I work the fourth shift, and it's really starting to wear me down,' Vernacini continued. 'And having to buy a new shirt every time my body is flattened out to 4,000 times its usual surface area is one more strain on my budget that I don't need.' Some businesses have already installed a rip in the space-time continuum in their break-room areas so that employees can report for work in the other dimension as soon as their Earth shifts end. People who regularly work the fourth shift have reported that the tasks they perform are more or less exactly the same as during their other shifts, though they have to contend with frequent plasma storms and occasionally meet themselves leaving for one shift as they arrive for another, which can be demoralizing. 'The worst part about my job in the other dimension is trying to digest the silica-based food product they serve in the cafeteria,' said Thomas Kinney, a line inspector who takes on a fourth shift three days a week at the Coca-Cola bottling plant in alternate Atlanta, GA. 'It's probably the most painful part of working a fourth shift. That, and not getting to see my kids grow up.' People across the country have reported similar problems associated with working extra hours in another dimension. The biggest complaint arises from the fact that work time continues in the fourth shift when the employee is not working there. This often results in workers arriving to find that they are far behind in their labor and have to stay longer in the alternate dimension in order to catch up. 'This is just another big 'screw you' to hardworking Americans,' said single mother Laura Tanner, who often works concurrent fourth shifts as both a cashier at an area Citgo station and a nursing home caregiver. 'Did you know my employer doesn't cover my health insurance while I'm in the other realm? And just yesterday I arrived at my alternate work and, looking at the schedule, discovered that I had somehow convinced myself to pick up my own fourth shift the following evening. What am I supposed to do about that?' An economic stimulus package from the other plane of existence is expected to provide some relief to those who work the extra-dimensional shift.

Sign up.)We turn to Andrew Pollack, a former biotechnology reporter for The New York Times, who is based in Los Angeles, for todayâ€™s introduction. The pharmaceutical industry has contributed $109 million to defeat Proposition 61, the most money raised for or against any of the 17 statewide ballot initiatives this year.The measure, which comes at a time of heightened public concern over drug pricing, would prohibit the state government from paying a higher price for a drug than the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, which gets big mandatory discounts and can negotiate with drug makers for even steeper ones.If approved, Proposition 61 could mean savings for Californiaâ€™s public employees and retirees, its prison system and part of Medi-Cal, the stateâ€™s Medicaid program. But the size of savings is unclear, and could range from â€œrelatively littleâ€ to â€œsignificant,â€ according to the nonpartisan state legislative analyst.One reason for the uncertainty is whether state agencies will be able to determine what Veterans Affairs pays for certain drugs. Another reason is that pharmaceutical companies might try to offset Proposition 61 by charging higher prices to other customers, including the V.A. Advertisements opposing Proposition 61 that now saturate the airwaves often feature veterans saying the measure would raise prices for them and others.Still, the drug manufacturers paying for these commercials are probably worried less about the mechanics of Proposition 61 than the precedent its approval would set for more government control of prices. Other states may try similar measures. And Medicaid programs in all states might have to be offered the lower prices paid by California agencies.Supporters of the initiative say the threat of countervailing price increases is an empty one and that it is time to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry. Almost all of the more than $14.7 million contributed to support the measure comes from its sponsor, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which runs pharmacies and treatment centers for people with H.I.V.Other supporters include the California Nurses Association and the state branch of AARP. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has held rallies in California to campaign for the measure, which he said would be â€œa real blow against this greedy industry that will reverberate all over America.â€Despite the pharmaceutical industry war chest, the measure was comfortably ahead in some polls conducted in September. California newspapers generally oppose the measure because of its specifics, while acknowledging the temptation for a protest vote against high drug prices.Dig into analyses of all 17 statewide measures by the Legislative Analystâ€™s Office, CALmatters, KQED and Ballotpedia.â€¢ New research debunks a long-held belief that one man was responsible for most of the spread of AIDS.

It courted scandal â€” and obscenity charges â€” with its depictions of Jewish culture and homosexuality. Its New York producer and cast members were arrested and found guilty, but the show remained open.Ms. Vogelâ€™s play â€œIndecent,â€ which had a well-received and extended run at the Vineyard Theater this year, is based on the history of â€œGod of Vengeanceâ€ and is performed in English, Yiddish and German.

"Hip-hop artist Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, said he was left wholly terrified today after meeting his daughter Hailies new boyfriend Justin Denham, an 18-year-old who was reportedly raised on the rappers music. Saying he could barely fathom the thought of Hailie, 17, with a man who ever enjoyed listening to, or was inspired by, his often misogynistic and violent lyrics, Eminem, 40, claimed he was disturbed from the second Denham said he was a huge fan of all of the rappers seven albums. Justin said I was his favorite artist when he was growing up, and now he wants to go out with my little girl, said Eminem, telling reporters he didnt even want to imagine what Denhams views on relationships could possibly entail given his self-professed love of albums that include songs about mutilating women. Honestly, I dont really know what Im supposed to do here. How am I supposed to let Hailie go out with a guy who says I was a huge influence on him and all of his friends? I mean, this guys probably listened to my song Kim, Eminem continued. I rapped about cutting my wifes throat and then driving around with her in my trunk in that song. Jesus. Citing lyrics where he discussed raping a woman with an umbrella to make her pussy wider, the visibly shaken multi-platinum artist said he cant imagine sitting by while his oldest daughter spends time alone with a man whose worldview could have been even slightly influenced by any of his songs. Eminem added that while Hailie has repeatedly claimed Justin is a good guy who treats her well, he seriously doubts anyone who likes the song Kill You, where he brutally describes killing a woman and hiding her in a closet, could ever be a decent person. His favorite song is Supermana track where I said I was going to put anthrax on a girls tampon and slap her until she cant stand, said Eminem, adding he could only imagine the types of drugs and alcohol songs like Purple Pills and Crack A Bottle had led him to do. He better not think he can get away with all this stuff with Hailie. Or maybe he does. I mean, this is a guy who was listening to me rap about beating women ever since he was just a kid. And his parents let him listen to it? Eminem continued. What kind of house was that? I dont even want to think about what kind of people they are. Eminem went on to say he was even further dismayed when Denham said he also grew up listening to artists such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Ludacris, and told reporters he could only imagine the sorts of relationship lessons he pulled out of music like Bitches Aint Shit and Move Bitch. At this point, I suppose it would be ideal for Hailie to date someone who never listened to any one of my songs, ever, said Eminem. Why cant she find someone who listened to music that wasnt about having sex with prostitutes and then painting a room red with their blood? Jesus, Eminem added, I have to go find my daughter right now. ",0
"To 14-year-old Milton Hervishbolt, the thrill of an efficient checkmate used to be the most rousing bodily sensation imaginable. Before his first sexual experience, Milton Hervishbolt was considered the top under-15 chess mind in the nation. He has vowed never to play the game again. A pawn promotion for a last-second Queen assault used to stoke the fire of lifes passion. A careful study of grandmasters like Ponziani, Fisher and Karpov used to occupy every synapse of his mind. But no more. Milton recently had his first sexual experience, chess coach Sergei Kostronvich said. And his interest in the subtleties and beauty of the game of chess has been usurped by a newfound interest in ejaculation. Hervishbolts experience, delineated by Kostronvich at a press conference, took place at a downtown hotel where a juniors chess tournament was held last weekend. According to Kostronvich, the busty wife of a tournament organizer lured Hervishbolt to her hotel room and rubbed his genital region briefly, causing him to ejaculate. He then promptly fled. Im not sure what she did, Hervishbolt said, But it felt even better than when I beat Ned Tiedelman with a Muzio gambit in the third-level junior masters last fall. Many young chess masters leave the game after discovering sex, according to a recent Chess Monthly study. The human orgasm is reportedly very pleasurable, chess analyst Doris Gyklina said, herself once a grandmaster. From the time of first orgasm on, a chess prodigy, if given the choice between the carnal forces of human sexuality and playing a game of chess, will invariably choose sex. Especially if it is with another human. According to his coach, Hervishbolts only previous contact with a female took place in a tri-state rank trial. Hervishbolt was pitted against a 9-year-old female opponent, Sandra Kloust, renowned in her upstate New York school district for her undefeated elementary chess record. It didnt matter to Milton that she was a female, Kostronvich said. Reportedly, the girls flat chest and underdeveloped pheromone glands made her incapable of arousing the boy. Hervishbolts seductress, 43-year-old Wendy Menkis, supports Hervishbolts decision to give up the game. I have always fantasized about tea-ching a fresh young boy the art of making love, Menkis said. I find their youth and inexperience an in-credible turn-on. When asked, Men--kis admitted she does not care about chess, nor does she have any interest in learning the intricacies of the game. Hervishbolt, also no longer interested in chess, plans to pursue more sexual experiences. I will employ the technique of encirclement to ensnare a female, he said, outlining his plans for the immediate future. Threat-ening a for-king check, i.e. N-K7ch, I will capture her En Passant, much like the pawn. It is at that point that I will be in position to touch her boob. ",0
"Only two British newspapers failed to feature a picture of Jo Cox on their front pages today, as the terrorist killer of the MP was jailed: the Financial Times and the Daily Mail.  The editorial judgment is unsurprising, as far as the Financial Times is concerned. The neo-Nazi loner Thomas Mair was found guilty of murdering Cox on the same day as the first autumn statement from the chancellor, Philip Hammond. And for a financial newspaper that considers itself more global than British, this meant the news led its front-page briefing column instead.   Related: Far-right terrorist Thomas Mair jailed for life for Jo Cox murder   But for Britainâ€™s biggest-selling mid-market tabloid, the Daily Mail, not to refer to Cox and her killer until page 30 was not only surprising but a shock.  Nearly all other papers put a smiling picture of the Labour MP and mother of two young children on their front page on the day her killer received a full life sentence â€“ even if they led their news coverage on the economy.  So what happened at the Mail? And what does it say about that paperâ€™s view of â€“ and impact on â€“ the UKâ€™s political life that the verdict on the first murder of a sitting MP for 26 years can be relegated so far inside its pages? The story about Mairâ€™s sentence came after a full 17 pages welcoming the verdict of an â€œupbeat chancellorâ€ confounding those dastardly â€œremain doom-mongersâ€. In the pages that followed this autumn statement coverage came news reports about â€œlaughing migrantsâ€, photos of a bikini-clad model taking a shower and the headline news that Santa is not real. They also featured a full-page column asking why leftwing comics laugh at the Queen.   It is surely worth asking whether the threat from far-right extremist terrorists is taken seriously by the British press   When todayâ€™s Mail finally gets to the verdict on Mair, the main headline points out that he â€œwanted to kill his own motherâ€, while the secondary story asks: â€œDid neo-Nazi murder Jo over fear heâ€™d lose council house he grew up in?â€  Most newspapers (certainly not just the Guardian) cited the judgeâ€™s own verdict that Mair killed her to advance his violent white supremacist ideology rather than because he â€œsuspected the MP might not have helped himâ€ to fight the councilâ€™s bid to move him. The introduction to the Mail piece â€“ which states that Mair â€œmay have murdered MP Jo Cox because he feared losing his home of 40 years to an immigrant familyâ€ â€“ prompted law professor James Chalmers to tweet â€œturns out there really is nothing the Daily Mail canâ€™t blame on immigrantsâ€.  Turns out there really is nothing the Daily Mail can't blame on immigrants. pic.twitter.com/5jLMr5Ic9kâ€” James Chalmers (@ProfChalmers) November 24, 2016  The evidence of his fear of losing his council house comes from interviews with Mairâ€™s neighbours and, largely, his stepfatherâ€™s half-sister. There is, however, no mention of how close the relationship was between a white supremacist and the family of his black stepfather. There are of course several arguments that can be made by the Mail and its many fans about its placement of this particular story: newspapers make tricky editorial decisions every day; they wanted to feature this across two pages free of advertising; and, for the paperâ€™s huge number of online readers, where the story sits in the paper wonâ€™t actually matter. (Although itâ€™s worth noting that Mail Online again highlighted Mairâ€™s mental health and thoughts of matricide rather than his extreme ideology.) And yet the Mailâ€™s carefully crafted and hugely successful print edition is read by almost more people than any other daily paper in Britain (and is fast approaching the most widely read of all, the Sun). It is surely worth asking whether the threat from far-right extremist terrorists is taken seriously by the British press, or at least its most politically powerful publication.  On the day Cox was killed the Mailâ€™s front page focused on the tragic waste of a woman â€œbrutally murdered by a loner with a history of mental illnessâ€ as did many others. This was a week before the EU referendum, and Mairâ€™s shouts of â€œBritain firstâ€ and â€œThis is for Britainâ€ were probably considered incendiary.   Related: Should Thomas Mair be considered a terrorist? | Hugh Muir and Joseph Harker   Yet Mairâ€™s trial and most notably the judgeâ€™s verdict suggested that there was far more to his crime than the evil act of a mentally ill man.  When Lee Rigbyâ€™s killers were found guilty of a terrorist act, they were not called simply mentally ill but ideologically motivated. When Ian Gow, the last sitting MP to be killed, died in 1990, the members of the Provisional IRA who did it were not called simply unhinged. These are politically dangerous times. The EU referendum and the US election have shown that fears over immigration and the economy are real and divisive.  So it is even more important that the media, which prides itself on real, not fake news, does not hide the true story â€“ however unpleasant or contrary to their own worldview it might be.

"Ask The Times, a Times Insider feature, draws on New York Times expertise to answer questions about current events, science, sports, culture and whatever else is making headlines.A reader asks: Could we ease subway system congestion in U.S. cities by dissuading people from walking up moving stairs, the way theyâ€™re doing in London? (And isnâ€™t this tantamount to an anti-exercise campaign? First we had couch potatoes; next weâ€™ll have escalator potatoes!) While weâ€™re at it, instead of adding more pedestrian plazas or widening sidewalks to deal with foot traffic overflowing onto city streets, we might as well install moving sidewalks. This wouldnâ€™t be the first â€œJetsonsâ€ pie-in-the-sky idea to come true.Steven Erlanger, The Timesâ€™s London bureau chief, considers the question.The experiment at the Holborn station of Londonâ€™s subway system, the Underground, continues.Officials say that test results are showing that at the busiest times, during morning and evening rush hours, standing on both sides of the up escalators reduces congestion by about 30 percent: Around 16,220 people can travel on the escalators, compared with the previous 12,745.But these are very steep escalators, and the Underground has cleverly left a third up escalator (yes, there are three) free for anyone who cares to climb. So people can get their steps in if they wish.Even on the other two escalators, people sometimes choose to climb â€” there is no penalty involved, but it does tend to create some friction when the climbers bump into those who are doing as asked and standing side by side on each escalator step.London is not a city without opportunities to walk great distances. In fact, the subway stations are quite far apart compared with those in Paris and New York, and deeper, too, so I donâ€™t think any worries about obesity are a function of the transport system!Iâ€™ve lived in New York, Boston and Washington, all of which have subway systems affected by varying degrees of decomposition and overcrowding. The deepest system is in Washington, where the escalators (when they work) are so slow you think youâ€™re dying or dreaming. So this experiment would never work there, because if you donâ€™t climb the escalators, you feel as if youâ€™ll never get there. And New Yorkâ€™s and Bostonâ€™s are so shallow it wouldnâ€™t make any difference.As for moving sidewalks, theyâ€™re in most every airport, of course. But they donâ€™t move fast enough to make much difference, in my view, unless you walk along them, and then you have to push people with big suitcases out of the way. So I donâ€™t see a lot of benefit.Have a question for Ask The Times? Submit it using the form below.",1

However, as a public health-oriented psychiatrist who has been involved in gun violence prevention advocacy for years, I know that her call to arms is dangerously misguided.First, most gun safety advocates do not promote the violation of our Second Amendment right to arm ourselves for protection. Rather, we advocate reasonable and legal gun safety reforms â€” which the great majority of Americans support â€” to lessen our unique national epidemic of gun violence.Second, though a popular gun lobby argument, there is little to no evidence that an armed citizenry can safely and effectively defend itself from criminals, let alone mass shooters. Furthermore, data shows that gun ownership increases the risk of death by homicide and suicide, the latter of which is a major concern for the L.G.B.T. community.MARC W. MANSEAUBrooklyn",1

"PARIS â€” A Belgian judge sentenced 15 people on Tuesday for their involvement in a terrorist plot that was thwarted in early 2015 but was a harbinger of the deadly attacks later that year in Paris.The aborted plotâ€™s chief architect is believed to have been Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian operative for the Islamic State. Mr. Abaaoud traveled to the groupâ€™s bases in Syria and was the on-the-ground coordinator of the attacks on Nov. 13 in and around Paris, which killed 130 people.The plot that was halted in Verviers, a French-speaking city in southern Belgium, was the first in a series of terrorist operations that Mr. Abaaoud was believed to have planned but that never happened. By the time of the attacks in Paris, he had learned from his mistakes. Mr. Abaaoud was killed in a shootout in St. Denis, France, five days after those attacks.Of the 15 people sentenced on Tuesday, six were in the Brussels courtroom at the time; the other nine were tried in absentia because they were on the run, sick or dead. The sentences ranged from three to 16 years in prison, with three of the men receiving the maximum because of their participation in and leadership of the Verviers group.The others were convicted of supporting the terror network, but it was not clear how much they knew about the scope of the plot.Although Belgian prosecutors and the police described the Verviers plot as being at an â€œadvanced stage,â€ evidence presented at trial was not conclusive about the exact target.One of the most likely targets, mentioned on a cellphone used by Mr. Abaaoud that was obtained by the prosecutor in the Verviers case, was the Zaventem airport, Judge Pierre Hendrickx said in his verdict. He said a rough sketch found on one of the smartphones used by Mr. Abaaoud showed drawings of the arrival hall of an airport with the name Zaventem written nearby and a man pushing a trolley with the word â€œbombâ€ on it.The airport and a Brussels metro station were attacked about 14 months later, and 32 people were killed by a related terrorist network also connected to Mr. Abaaoud.The Belgian police interrupted the plot on the evening of Jan. 15, 2015, when they knocked on the door of a Verviers apartment. A gunfight broke out, and two of the three men in the apartment were killed; the third, Marouane El Bali, was wounded. He was sentenced on Tuesday to 16 years in prison.Among the items found in the apartment were ingredients for making the explosive TATP, semiautomatic weapons, 200 to 300 bullets and several police uniforms, perhaps suggesting that the would-be attackers were planning to use the uniforms as a disguise.The two-week trial painted the group of defendants as an informal network of friends and acquaintances, brought together in some cases by their upbringing in heavily migrant neighborhoods of Brussels and Paris, and in others by criminal connections. A few came from farther away and were brought in to assist because they had criminal experience, for example in stealing cars and forging documents, prosecutors said.Over all, however, many came across as adolescents playing at being terrorists. They thought up nicknames for one another â€” including Mustache, the Big One, Obama and Pashtun. They took photos of one another for fun.There are snapshots of Mr. Abaaoud in front of tourist sites in Athens, Judge Hendrickx said during the trial, and another photo of Mr. Abaaoud reclining in a large armchair. The judge referred to it as a â€œFather Christmasâ€ chair, with â€œwhat looks like a cucumber masqueâ€ on Mr. Abaaoudâ€™s face.Much of the planning and at least two of the apartments used as safe houses were in Athens. They were rented by Omar Damache, one of the Verviers defendants, who was sentenced to eight years. Mr. Abaaoud used them during at least one and possibly more of his journeys between Belgium and Syria, according to the prosecution.Mr. Damache, who did not seem to have known much about Mr. Abaaoudâ€™s intentions, had in his possession crucial evidence when the Greek police detained him, prosecutors said. Among the items were 14 cellphones, including three used by Mr. Abaaoud; two tablets; a computer; and seven French identification cards.",1
"Sweet Charity, the 1966 musical by Cy Coleman, Dorothy Fields and Neil Simon, is a tragedy with laugh lines. In a story loosely based on Federico Felliniâ€™s Nights of Cabiria, Charity Hope Valentine is a dancehall hostess who lobs herself from one wrong man to the next. The men lob back; at least a couple of them throw her into a lake.    Related: Dead Poets Society review â€“ superb Jason Sudeikis can't save ill-advised relaunch   But Charity, a cockeyed optimist, is stuck like a dope with a thing called hope and she canâ€™t get it out of her heart. Or her bed. Is it Prince Charming, this damsel needs or intensive behavioral therapy? The New Groupâ€™s stripped-down revival, directed by Leigh Silverman (Well, Violet) and starring the resplendent Sutton Foster (Younger, Anything Goes), often movingly suggests the dark side to Charityâ€™s perpetual sunniness.  Wearing a wig that suggests an electrocuted shag cut, Foster whirls around the stage in a purple shift dress and white go-go boots, singing about love and heartbreak with an eye-blinding smile that never leaves her face. Her Charity is dynamic, maybe even manic, and at least a little freaked out by the fickle fingers of fate that fling her from one dud to the next. But if this good-time girl ever allowed herself to stop for a second, she might realize these good times are actually pretty bad. So, under Joshua Bergasseâ€™s energetic choreography, she frugs on until she meets Oscar (Shuler Hensley), a claustrophobic fuddy-duddy who just might be her knight in wrinkled acrylic.   The material doesnâ€™t hold up especially well. The sexual politics are obviously dated and so is Simonâ€™s awkward vernacular. A scene set at a hepcat church is particularly puzzling. The plot is noodly and digressive, but then again that mirrors the heroine and itâ€™s part of her charm. The Coleman and Fields songs are still pretty good, with this production making much of Baby, Dream Your Dream and Iâ€™m a Brass Band.   Silvermanâ€™s interventions are few, but welcome. She has hired an all-female band, reordered a few of the songs, and de-emphasized the sensuality of the dance hall and its girls, while pointing up the camaraderie among the women who work there. Big Spender is still an angry number, just as in the original, but the mechanized sexiness of the Bob Fosse choreography has been replaced with something looser and more realistic. Similarly, we see the bra straps beneath the sequined teddies, the wig caps under the bouffants. The principal men, many of them played by Joel Perez, arenâ€™t glamorous either and Hensley doesnâ€™t try to mask Oscarâ€™s creepiness. The ending is more downbeat than some, though it offers some promise of change.   And how bleak can a piece really be with the smile and voice and legs of Sutton Foster vibrating at its center? The Linney Theatre and the Signature is an intimate space and she all but overwhelms it with that strapping mezzo soprano and indomitable talent. â€œWhere am I going?â€ Charity asks in the final song. Itâ€™s a fair question. But the answer as concerns Foster is clear: anywhere she wants.",1
"Anti-Gun Lunacy in DC: Man Found Guiltyof Owning Antique Replica BulletsLily Dane The raid was conducted by 30 agents in full tactical gear whose rampage through the home caused $10,000 in damage and terrified Witascheks teenaged children. Four items were confiscated during the raid, per the warrant: A successful financial adviser with no criminal history, Witaschek is now the first known case of a citizen being prosecuted in D.C. for inoperable ammunition. Yesterday, a D.C. judge found Witaschek guilty of attempted possession of unlawful ammunition for possessing antique replica muzzleloader bullets. The bullets caused confusion in the courtroom because D.C. residents do not need to register antique replica firearms. The judge repeatedly asked how the bullets could be illegal if the gun they are used for is not. This led some to believe he was going to throw out the charge. But in the end, Judge Morin said: In his piece titled Witaschek Verdict Highlights Anti-Gun Hypocrisy, Conor Higgins pointed out the problems with the judges statements: Witaschek addressed the judge before sentencing: Emily Miller of The Washington Times spoke with Witaschek about the verdict. Im completely outraged by it, he said. This is just a continuation of the nightmare. Just to sit there. I could not believe it.

The existence of this map does not mean that the Soviet Union was going to invade Brighton. It is military intelligence â€“ it is just in case.â€    Section of the 1990 Soviet map of Brighton, showing the Shoreham area. Photograph: 11861/British Library   The Brighton map was one of a number found in abandoned depots in Latvia in 1992, after the fall of communism. The maps show towns and cities in startling detail with buildings classified as military coloured green, industrial rendered black, administrative purple, and other premises brown. Harper said the maps were evidence of a global military mapping project that was similar to the American Corona satellite programme in the 1960s. Each map in the exhibition tells its own story, not all factual. Included is the original map artwork for the islands of San Serriffe, which was published by the Guardian on 1 April 1977. The Guardianâ€™s accompanying article claimed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the islandâ€™s independence â€“ but was in fact one of the most successful of all April Fool jokes. All the names for that map were linked to printing and typesetting. If people did not get San Serriffe, or its capital, Bodoni, then the fact the two main islands were called Upper Caisse and Lower Caisse should have been something of a clincher. The exhibition also shows literatureâ€™s Middle-earth maps, drawn by JRR Tolkien and his son, Christopher, to help guide readers of Lord of the Rings through Rohan, Gondor and Mordor.  There is also EH Shepardâ€™s pencil-drawn map of the Hundred Acre Wood, complete with Eeyoreâ€™s â€œgloomy placeâ€ and the Pooh â€œtrap for heffalumpsâ€, which was first published on the endpapers of AA Milneâ€™s Winnie the Pooh in 1926 and is on loan from the V&A Museum. Many of the maps illustrate some of the 20th centuryâ€™s most significant events. For the first time, four 3D relief models, from 1917, of the western front in Europe are going on display â€“ maps which first world war British generals, stationed a few miles behind the frontline, used to inform their decisions. Also being exhibited for the first time are British Ministry of Defence maps which imagine cold war battles and which were used in military college exams. One shows a nuclear explosion in Edinburgh and traces how far the fallout would spread.    Nazi 1940 map plotting locations of European immigrants living in the US. Photograph: British Library   From the second world war there is a map produced by the Nazis showing the distribution, by state, of first and second generation immigrants to America. The information would have helped Joseph Goebbelsâ€™ propaganda ministry to direct adverts urging the US to stay out of the war. Another key part of the show is mobility and transport. The exhibits include a â€œReshaping of the British railways mapâ€ showing just how much of the rail network Richard Beeching planned, in the early 1960s, to dispense with, and Harry Beckâ€™s early sketch for his groundbreaking London tube map. Harper said the aim was to illustrate the variety of maps and the technology behind them, which in the 20th century, for the first time, were at peopleâ€™s fingertips. â€œMaps became important, powerful, objective tools to help navigate the strange, brave new world,â€ he said. â€¢ Maps and the 20th Century: Drawing the Line is at the British Library from 4 November to 1 March 2017",1
"Prison Mate With Freddie Gray Reveals Evidence That Changes EVERYTHING According to a source obtained by The Washington Post, a prisoner who shared a police van with Freddie Gray told investigators that he believes Gray was intentionally trying to injure himself while in police custody. The source, who remains confidential, told investigators that Gray was banging against the walls of the transport van throughout the ride. However, the prisoner was in a separate section than Gray and could not see him. Another source maintains that Gray was shackled [while in the van] because he was irate and angry. Still, the attorney for the Gray family maintains that their son did not injure himself. We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord, attorney Jason Downs told the Washington Post. We question the accuracy of the police reports weve seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr. Gray was arrested without force or incident. What do you think? Is there more to this story that the media isnt telling us? ",0
"School Idiocy: Ban All the Things!Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton Nothing is too absurd for our public (government indoctrination camps) schools to ban and punish children over these days. Todays headlines read more like The Onion than reality, but its actually not even remotely funny that the majority of our nations kids are being subjected to this idiotic lunacy every single day. The extension of zero tolerance policies on guns to toy guns, fake guns and wild imaginations has baffled parents and instituted a culture of fear that aims punish children for seemingly innocent play. Kids have been disciplined and even arrested for wielding water guns, a Hello Kitty bubble gun, pop tarts half-eaten to shape a crude gun, a gun key chain, imaginary grenades and weapons and a poor socially confused boy who has been held into account for role playing Lord of the Rings and vowing to make a classmate disappearat recess via a magic ring. A three-year-old deaf child was even told he should change his name because one of the signs to spell his name supposedly resembled a gun. Does that tell you what they have planned for our culture? Now, Tennessee has introduced legislation to ban squirt guns and toy weapons of any kind within 150 feet of a school. This would literally criminalize even pretending to have a gun fight while further conditioning the next generation to fear guns and think them to be illegal. Likely water balloon fights if organized amongst enough members of the community are to be regarded as brewing insurgencies. Ridiculous, or dangerous? A column on Fox News addressed the underlying message of disciplining kids for this stuff: That all real-life guns are bad and the mere thought of them is worthy of punishment? What about the guns those childrens parents may be using to defend their homes? But guns, and various visages of them, arent the only issue. There is also the politically correct by undermining social norms and educationally-modifying students to become comfortable serfs in the techno-dictatorship that is cementing around us. Common Core has confused the language of learning and uprooted many of the most sensible elements in public education. It didnt start with Common Core, but it is rotting quite rapidly under it. Cursive handwriting has been declared obsolete, along with the right to express emotions and even have a gender identity. Yes, some schools have begun instructing teachers that they may no longer separate boys and girls in groups or even refer to little girls by such terms as her or boys by him. Instead, inclusive and progressive re-educators are being told to call them purple penguins and make no distinction between their differences. They are also engaged in the stamping out of cultural ties to religion and nation, with efforts to punish those who would speak of God in schools or dare to wear an American flag themed t-shirt. Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton created TruthstreamMedia.com, where this article first appeared, as an outlet to examine the news, uncover the deceptions, pierce through the fabric of illusions, know the real enemy, unshackle from the system, and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives, one step at a time, so that one day we might truly be free ",0
"As they ambled through the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side last week, the Haim sisters â€” Tagel, Tair and Liron â€” made a playful detour. Stopping at a produce stand, Tagel lifted a pair of peppers to her ears.She was showing off her makeshift earrings when her siblings joined her. Tagel dropped the peppers and grinned wickedly as she hoisted two squash breast high; Liron lifted another, perfectly contoured to the line of her hips.â€œEverything is natural, just like the shapes of our bodies,â€ Tagel said, moving on to a bin lavishly piled with yellow and orange cherry tomatoes.The sisters (not to be confused with Haim, the California sister trio), in their late 20s and early 30s and known collectively as the music group A-Wa (Arabic for â€œYes!â€), had gathered the makings of a crazy salad. An unlikely fusion of disparate elements, it was something like their sound, a resolutely upbeat mixture of hip-hop and electro pop beats and the melodies of their Yemeni heritage.Relaxing before a performance at Webster Hall in the East Village, they darted past pyramids of fruit and shelves lined with exotic coffee blends and cheeses, dressed in a chaotic mash-up of flowing floral- and fruit-pattern skirts, which were nearly lost amid the gaily colored produce.â€œMarkets are always so colorful and diverse,â€ Tagel said. â€œYou get to see stuff, smell it, touch it.â€Finishing her thought, Liron chimed in, â€œThey play on all your senses.â€Their music videos, too, encourage audiences to sample, absorb and practically inhale the sensations of the desert where the young women grew up. At its debut last year, their hit single, â€œHabib Galbi,â€ inspired by a Yemeni folk song and shot in the arid landscape of the Arava Valley in Israel, gained an international audience, including Europeans and Mipsterz (Muslim hipsters), and close to 3.7 million views on YouTube.The sisters distill and interpret the folk songs of their grandparents, singing in what they call Yemenite, a nearly extinct dialect of Arabic spoken by the Jews of Yemen.â€œWe werenâ€™t sure how people were going to accept three young women bringing Yemeni music to the front stage,â€ said Tair, the most robustly outspoken of the three. â€œWe didnâ€™t label ourselves as Yemeni Jews or anything else. We announced ourselves as a fresh sound from the desert.â€œWe wanted people to look at the video and feel no judgment,â€ she added. â€œWe wanted to confuse them â€” in a good way.â€Their message, one of inclusion, is reinforced in their day-to-day lives by spontaneously generous, if unabashedly corny, gestures. â€œWe spread the love,â€ Tair said of their habit of sending fans they know well videos to celebrate a wedding day, a graduation or a bar or bat mitzvah.She drove home the point, stopping with her sisters at a corner market on Rivington Street to buy sunflowers, and promptly distributed them to random passers-by.But enough. Before long, the three grew restless, peering avidly into shop windows, unable, finally, to resist the blandishments of Edith Machinist, a vintage store on Rivington. They popped in, slipped on shoes, plucked tunics from the racks and chattered in an animated mix of Hebrew and English peppered with Arabic phrases.â€œI feel like one of Cinderellaâ€™s stepsisters,â€ Tair said, grumbling good-naturedly as she tried to wedge her feet into a pair of minuscule flats.â€œI love all the â€” how do you call them? â€” Oxford shoes,â€ Tagel said. Alongside her, Liron checked her reflection, holding aloft a tiger-pattern top.â€œItâ€™s very light, like a kimono,â€ she said.In a matter of seconds, she had sprinted toward the front of the shop to pose gamely for her sisters in an old-fashion-looking DKNY straw cloche. â€œI like it,â€ Tair said, coaxing, â€œMake like Jane from Tarzanâ€ and â€œShow your bangs, girl.â€Parched from their hectic shopping rounds, the three, joined by their stylist Ron Ben Nun, retreated to the home of Michelle Caputo, a television producer and friend, settling on her palmy terrace on the Lower East Side to sample wine and cheese. The conversation returned to their sound, which incorporates shards of Motown, Ella Fitzgerald and North African beats.In their music, as in their look, â€œWe are not just one thing,â€ Tair said. â€œWeâ€™re saying, â€˜Itâ€™s O.K. to celebrate the many parts of who you are.â€™â€Their style, Ms. Ben Nun acknowledged, is laden with symbolism. A pattern of prickly pears swarmed over Tagelâ€™s floor-length dress. â€œThey are Sabra,â€ she said, referring simultaneously to the desert flower and the native-born Israelis who bear its name.And what of those other three musical sisters who share their last name? â€œWe like Haim and would love to meet them,â€ they said nearly in unison. â€œPeople think weâ€™re related,â€ Tair said. Theyâ€™re not.But then, as she was prompt to interject, â€œWe are all related.â€",1
"I used to be a disciplined morning writer, but in the spring of 2010 I was visiting a router-making facility in Shanghaiâ€™s Pudong district and witnessed thousands of workers in robinâ€™s egg blueÂ jumpsuits building the equipment necessary to pole-vault Chinaâ€™s technological connectedness ahead of all other countries in our new world order. This tableau prompted in me a gentle realisation that the world was changing even more quickly than Iâ€™d thought it was, and that Iâ€™d better shake things up creatively to keep pace with it. I asked myself a few questions: howÂ can I imbue fiction with that same fractal sense of falling down a rabbit hole that we all experience when weâ€™re online? How can writing compete with Netflix? How could I compress emotion into as few words as possible â€“ not just on a page but something people can read from a car at 50 miles per hour?   Related: Novelist Douglas Coupland: the man who sees into the future   To this end I deliberately upended what had been a 20-year-old writing routine. No more AM clock-based passivity, quietly awaiting words that may or may not come depending on the fussiness of my muse. No more predictability; instead of sitting there feeling nostalgic for my pre-internet brain, I tried to figure out what my new brain was becoming and how that affected my writing. So if you ask me what is my typical writing day, I have no specific answer, just a series of tendencies which together define myÂ new writing normal. One: I do much of my writing on planes. Iâ€™m actually at my happiest when Iâ€™m writing on a plane, and Iâ€™m writing these words on a plane right now, Lufthansa flight 1436 from Frankfurt to St Petersburg. Thereâ€™s no Wi-Fi (sanctuary!) and Iâ€™m having that not unpleasant sensation of soon-to-end Schengen-era statelessness â€“ the kind of transnational fluidity so accurately touted by Monocle magazine â€“ a headspace where all the men wear slim-fit clothing and all the women in little black dresses go back to the office from the Embassy function to do some late night C++ coding. Q: Would you like a glass of water with your vodka tonic?A: No. Thatâ€™s why God invented iceÂ cubes. Two: I do much of my writing in hotel rooms, especially if thereâ€™s a deadline. Actually, since I wrote the above paragraph Iâ€™ve landed and am now in the St Petersburg W hotel which has killer Wi-Fi and interior design choices possibly made (in the best possible sense) by an oligarchâ€™s mistress. Thereâ€™s something about being in a hotel room â€“ most writers know this implicitly â€“ that frees up oneâ€™s thinking. First you place a scorched earth do-not-disturb on yourÂ email account (autoreply: â€œIâ€™m dead and hence unable to reply to your emailâ€) and second, hide the mobile phone in the desk drawer and â€¦ itâ€™s almost as good as being on a plane. Nobody can reach you. Youâ€™re safe. Three: I write in places connected in definable ways to the forces of both globalisation and deglobalisation: Shanghai router-making facilities; Chilean classrooms taken over by protesting students, the rooms now converted into artistsâ€™ studios; the International House of Pancakes on theÂ north side of Interstate 15 in Las Vegas. The more random and unexpected the better.    Interstate 15, Las Vegas. Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images   Thereâ€™s a kind of existential heebie-jeebies that accompanies the abandonment of routine: what if I lose my skills and they never come back? What if I become too fragmented? What if the forces of the future Iâ€™m trying to depictÂ crush me like a bug? But then, nothing ventured, nothing gained. TheÂ world has never been so interesting as it is now. How sad not toÂ go out and bungee-jump into it fromÂ a cosmic New Zealand cliff. A few years back, the New York Times did a series of photos of writers in their writing places. All of the other ones I saw were of desks in almost empty white rooms with linen sheers blowing in through the windows. The photo of me was of a small room painted black with all of the walls covered in shelving that was densely filled with hoarder-like amounts of design objects and art. I donâ€™t understand why writers would want an empty white room. Itâ€™s like a metaphor for no life after life after death. My spaces will never be normal; normal has never seemed to be my friend.

Closing summary: a dramatic day for the pound











The day began with news of a flash crash in the value of the pound against the dollar in Asian trading. 





The pound plunged from about $1.26 to $1.18 in the space of two minutes. 





And no one knows why. 





Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments:











The sudden and shock 6% drop in the pound in Asia trading puzzled and shocked investors. Fat fingers, algorithms, and tough Brexit comments from President Hollande were all offered as possible explanations

















Sterling regained some of the lost ground, and is currently down 1.6% at $1.2416





The FTSE 100 was the only major European index to rise, and is currently up 0.7% or 46 points to 7,046

















HSBC issued a very gloomy note on the pound, predicting it will fall to $1.10 and reach parity against the euro by the end of 2017

















The Bank of England says it is â€œlooking atâ€ the causes of the flash crash

















UK industrial output fell unexpectedly in August, and is likely to be a drag on third quarter growth according to economists

















Speaking in Washington DC, Philip Hammond said the government will sell-off its remaining 9.1% stake in Lloyds Banking Group, selling directly into the market. It means Hammond is abandoning George Osborneâ€™s plan to offer cut price shares to the public

















And sticking in the US, the September non-farm payrolls report was weaker than expected, but economists said it does not rule out the possibility of a rate hike in December











Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. The latest developments throughout the rest of the day will be here. Have a great weekend. AM

Returning Lloyds to the private sector is the right thing to do & our plan will get back all the cash taxpayers invested in it.â€” Philip Hammond (@PHammondMP)

Government announces Lloyds sell-off











While the non-farms were being published in the US, the UK government announced it is going to sell its remaining 9.1% stake in Lloyds Banking Group directly into the stock market.





This means it is abandoning George Osborneâ€™s plan to offer the public cut price shares.





From Washington, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said:











Returning Lloyds to the private sector is in the interests of the bank, taxpayers and the country as a whole. That is why exiting our stake in Lloyds in an orderly way and at the best possible price is one of my top priorities as chancellor.





I have listened to the experts. Ongoing market volatility means it is not the right time for a retail offer.





Our plan will get back all the cash taxpayers invested in Lloyds during the financial crisis and leave the bank in a better place to continue the crucial role it plays in supporting individuals, families and businesses up and down the UK.











It seems that Hammondâ€™s aim is to get rid of the governmentâ€™s stake in the bank over the next 12 months.





It looks like shares will be sold below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought a 43% stake in the bank for Â£20.3bn at the time of the 2008 crisis. The shares are trading around 53p.





The Treasury says that overall it will not make a loss because it has already raised about Â£16.9bn from previous sell-offs of Lloyds shares.

Rob Carnell, INGâ€™s chief international economist, appears underwhelmed by the US non-farm payrolls report for August, which he describes as â€œneither here nor thereâ€.





He says that the report does not rule out a US rate rise in December.











Reasonable, but not great payrolls, an uptick in the unemployment rate, and softish wages growth â€“ but still good enough to keep thoughts of a December rate hike alive â€“ pending the market reaction to the presidential election, and further adequate labour reports. 





Markets will see nothing in this report to encourage thoughts of a November Fed rate hike â€“ most forecasters still expect the Fed to hike in December, and this release is good enough, without being particularly good, to keep such expectations firm. 











Carnell flags up the key dates in the run-up to the Fedâ€™s December rate decision:

The weaker-than-expected 156,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September was weaker than the average monthly jobs growth of 178,000 so far this year.





The biggest single driver behind new jobs last month was the professional and business services sector, up 67,000.





There were also rises in healthcare jobs, retail, and the food and drink sectors.





But employment in other major industries, including manufacturing, construction, logistics and government were little changed.

The September jobs report from the US Labor Department also revealed a surprise rise in the unemployment rate to 5% from 4.9% in August.





Average earnings were in line with expectations, rising by 0.2% month-on-month, following a 0.1% increase in August.

Breaking: US non-farm payrolls lower than expected











There were 156,000 jobs added in September, lower than the 175,000 forecast by economists.





Thatâ€™s a significant miss. Slightly better news was that the figure for August was revised up to 167,000 from 151,000. More soon.

Itâ€™s almost time for US non-farm payrolls for September. 





Here are consensus expectations:











Non-farms: 175,000 (151,000 in August)

















Unemployment rate: 4.9% (4.9% in August)

Worth mentioning this morningâ€™s UK trade data for August, which was worse than expected.





Britainâ€™s trade in goods deficit widened to Â£12.1bn in August, from a downwardly revised Â£9.5bn in July according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had forecast an Â£11.3bn deficit.





The deficit widened so much because growth in imports was far sharper than growth in exports. Imports rose by Â£2.7bn to Â£37.9bn, while exports increased by just Â£100m to Â£25.8bn.





On a day when the pound is under the spotlight, the trade figures seem to suggest that as yet, the fall in sterling since the 23 June Brexit vote has yet to boost exports as hoped.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says investors only now seem to the reality of Brexit:











If the pound was a prize fighter the referee would have already rung the bell, the currency bloodied and bruised beyond belief. It seems that sterling is recreating last nightâ€™s flash crash in slow motion, its losses against the dollar widening to 2.6%, taking it under $1.23 in the process; against the euro things were just as bad, the pound plunging under â‚¬1.13 following a 2.4% fall. 





 Beyond the post-flash crash fear that seems to have taken hold of investors, the intensification of sterlingâ€™s decline can largely be pinned on two factors this morning. 





 Firstly, both the manufacturing and industrial production readings came in below expectations at 0.2% and -0.4% respectively, somewhat contradicting the positive PMIs from earlier in the week. Secondly, and perhaps most damningly, HSBC issued a pretty bleak statement claiming that, as the â€˜defacto official opposition to the governmentâ€™s [Brexit] policiesâ€™, the pound could well find itself circling $1.10 by the end of next year.





 As has been the trend this week the poundâ€™s plight has proven to be catnip for the FTSE, with the UK index climbing 58 points to tickle 7070. The Eurozone indices, on the other hand, are less than enthused about the euroâ€™s recent strength, with the DAX and CAC both falling 0.8% apiece.

Sterling: how low did it go? (And why does it matter?). This FT piece from Katie Martin and Jennifer Hughes is well worth a read.





It talks about the technical difficulty of finding one correct figure for the poundâ€™s low in last nightâ€™s flash crash. They explain:











 The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system. In normal market conditions, this makes little if any difference. The move overnight wasâ€¦ not normal.





EBS, the trading platform owned and operated by ICAP and one of the central points of reference, particularly for sterling, says it is taking $1.1938 as the low â€“ a level that was traded â€œin low amountâ€.





Bloombergâ€™s reported low is $1.1841.





Thomson Reuters, however, is our outlier. Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 â€“ wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT â€“ or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.





That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a â€œmarket lowâ€ where a â€œgood amountâ€ â€“ ie, Â£5m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window. This low was $1.15 and happened â€œaround the same time as the absolute low.â€





Good luck to the traders trying to work this one out.

Juncker: EU must be firm with UK on Brexit





























The message is coming in loud and clear from the EU now: we will be tough with the UK on Brexit.





The latest comments come from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.





Speaking in Paris on Friday, he said:











 It should be obvious that if the United Kingdom wants to have free access to the [EUâ€™s] internal market all the rules and all the liberties...need to be fully respected.





You canâ€™t have one foot in and one foot out. On this point we need to be intransigent. I see the manoeuvring.











Expectations are mounting that the UK is in store for a so-called â€œhard Brexitâ€, with the UK government prioritising greater control on immigration over full access to the single market.





Here is our full story on those tough Brexit comments from the French President, FranÃ§ois Hollande:

Pound falls below $1.24; FTSE gains 75 points











After regaining some ground following the overnight 6% drop in the pound, it is now down 2% against the dollar at $1.2335.





But investors are putting their money into Britainâ€™s biggest, global companies, listed on the FTSE 100. The index of major shares is up 76 points or 1% at 7,075.





Jasper Lawler, market analysts at CMC markets, said markets are a little â€œdazed and confusedâ€ today.











Traders have been left reeling from a historic flash crash in the pound. A weaker pound continues to be a positive for UK equities, which were flirting with record highs. 





But the size of the drop in currency markets was not mirrored in the rise in the FTSE 100. The benefits of a weaker pound for exports and higher inflation are being offset by a concern the exchange rateâ€™s decline has become destabilising.





Equity indices in the Eurozone, which donâ€™t reap the currency benefits of a devalued British pound were showing caution, down slightly, ahead of this afternoonâ€™s US jobs data.

UK industry shrinks unexpectedly in August











There have been disappointing figures from Britainâ€™s industrial sector this morning. 





Industrial output fell unexpectedly in August by 0.4%, following a 0.1% rise in July according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting a 0.1% increase.





Manufacturing output - classed as a sub sector of the broader industrial measure - also disappointed, rising by 0.2% in August against expectations of a 0.5% increase. It was better than July however, when output fell by 0.9%.





Mining and quarrying was the biggest drag on industry in August, falling by 3.7%, largely because of maintenance in several North Sea oil fields .





It slowed the annual growth rate of industrial production to 0.7% in August from 2.1% in July. Economists said the sector was likely to be a drag on economic growth in the third quarter overall.





Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes industrial production is set for a 0.2% fall quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. 





He adds:











Thankfully, however, strong increases in services output in June and July suggest that GDP growth wonâ€™t slow too sharply in Q3; we still expect 0.5% growth.

Bank of England to investigate crash in pound





























The Bank of England has confirmed that it will investigate why the pound plunged inexplicably overnight. 





A simple statement from the Bank, but a significant one:











 We are looking at the causes of the sharp falls over night.











Although the pound has regained some ground following the 6% fall, it is still down 1.6% at $1.2409 against the dollar.





It has left the pound on course for its worst week since the Brexit vote in June.

HSBC: pound will drop to $1.10 by end of 2017











A very gloomy prediction from HSBC. The bankâ€™s currency experts say the pound has some way to go before it reaches a bottom.





Specifically, they say the pound will fall to $1.10 against the dollar and hit parity against the euro by the end of 2017, as fears of a hard Brexit intensify.





David Bloom, HSBCâ€™s global head of FX, says the pound has become a political currency.











 Brexit, whether one likes it or not, is a political decision, one we have to respect. The currency is now the de facto official opposition to the governmentâ€™s policies.





The argument which is still presented to us, that the UK and EU will resolve their difference and come to an amicable deal, appears a little surreal. It is becoming clear that many European countries will come to the negotiation table looking for political damage limitation rather than economic damage limitation. A lose-lose situation is the inevitable outcome.





The pound used to be a relatively simple currency that used to trade on cyclical events and data, but now it has become a political and structural currency. This is a recipe for weakness given its twin deficits.

The FT has taken an interesting look at how the pound fell from $1.26 against the dollar to a little over $1.18 in two minutes. 





Below is an extract, but you can read the full piece here.











In the Hong Kong/Singapore timezone, 7.07am to 7.09am. In the 60 seconds from 7.07am, the pound moved from $1.26 through $1.25 to a low of $1.203. Between $1.26 and $1.25, traders say the move was orderly. But when it tumbled through $1.24 â€œthat was when all hell broke loose,â€ according to one banker.





The low was $1.1819 at 7.09am, based on Reuters data. It took a further 30 minutes for the pound to regain $1.24, during which time activity was fairly steady as traders regained composure after that unnerving tumble.

It is expected to show a 175,000 increase in jobs in September, following a disappointing 151,ooo rise in August.





Average earnings are expected to pick up 0.2% over the month, following a 0.1% rise in August.





As ever, the report will be closely scrutinised by investors and economists for signs of whether it makes a US rate hike more or less likely before the end of 2016.

Back to the theory that the massive sell-off of the pound was down to algorithms...





Analysts say that the move could have been triggered by automated trading systems reacting to the news report on Hollande. 





The idea is that computers are set to sell the pound if they detect negative news stories on Brexit.





Of course, the good old fat finger theory has not been discounted, which refers to human error, when a trader enters a number by mistake.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, says the pound had a â€œrollercoaster rideâ€ overnight.





She says the politics are proving a dangerous game for the pound:











The big issue for the pound right now is that it has become detached from the economic fundamentals and politics have become king. This is where things will get dangerous for the currency going forward. 





Theresa Mayâ€™s hard-line on Brexit negotiations and her insistence that negotiations will take place in private have only increased uncertainty for the market, with traders left combing news websites for the latest headlines to try and gauge for themselves the state of play between the UK and the EU.











Brooks also explains that we might never know what triggered last night dramatic crash (and we might see another one):











This highlights the drawback of machines making trading decisions, however, it is the reality, and it is only getting more popular. Thus, another flash crash is possible. 





Unlike the flash crash that impacted the Dow Jones in 2013 and which triggered an investigation by the US authorities, the FX market is not regulated in the same way, so there is unlikely to be an investigation and we may never know what actually happened last night. But, if there is another flash crash, the pound is vulnerable because such unstable forces are driving it.

Hollande's Brexit comments blamed for pound's flash crash





























French President Francois Hollande, gets tough on Brexit in a speech in Paris on Thursday

















The finger is being pointed at French President FranÃ§ois Hollande this morning. 





According to some, Hollandeâ€™s tough comments about Brexit negotiations are behind the shock fall in the pound overnight.





Speaking in Paris at a dinner attended by some of the most senior EU officials, including the Commissionâ€™s President Jean-Claude Juncker, Hollande said:











 The UK has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit. Well, then we must go all the way through the UKâ€™s willingness to leave the EU. We have to have this firmness.





If not, we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the EU. Other countries would want to leave the EU to get the supposed advantages without the obligations.





There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price. Otherwise we will be in a negotiation that cannot end well.











Referring to the time when Jacques Delors, Hollandeâ€™s mentor, had to deal with â€œa crisis triggered by the UK tooâ€, the French President said:











Then Ms Thatcher wanted to stay in Europe, but she wanted a cheque in return. Now, the UK wants to leave and pay nothing. Itâ€™s not possible.

The agenda: pound suffers flash crash











Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.





The dramatic fall in the pound overnight has shaken the City this morning. The UK woke up to the news that sterling crashed more than 6% in two minutes in Asian trading, taking it to a new 31 year low of $1.1841.





Sterling has since regained some ground, and is now down 1.3% at $1.2453.





Algorithms, fat fingers, and mounting fears over a Hard Brexit have all been offered as possible explanations behind the major move, but nobody really knows why.





Itâ€™s worth pointing out that trading volumes were thin at the time, heightening the impact of any move. 





This will be considered a warning shot by some. A taste of things to come perhaps as Britain faces up to the serious challenges posed by the process of exiting the EU. 





We will be bringing you the latest throughout the day.

"Hillary Clintons Campaign Is Ruined After Donald Trump Makes THIS Massive Announcement Billionaire Donald Trump made waves when he launched his presidential campaign at the beginning of this week in New York. Trump was introduced by his daughter, and made a grand entrance to Rockin in the free world before he went on to make some bold and controversial statements about the current state of our government. The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everyone elses problems, Trump began, citing trade relations with China. He then went on to discuss the current candidates, and he didnt hold back. They will never make America great again, they dont even have a chance, he claimed. Our country needs a truly great leader and needs a truly great leader now. Ladies and gentleman, I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, Trump concluded. What do you think? Will you vote for Trump? ",0
"The Evidence Of Hillary Clinton And Lester Holt Rigging The Debate Leaked, And Now Its Over If you werent already convinced that last Mondays debate was rigged, a transcript of the debate has just been released, and it pretty much seals the deal. According to Breitbart, the transcript reveals that Holt directed 15 questions at Donald Trump, and only two questions exclusively at Hillary Clinton. Thats pretty startling for a 90-minute event. Here are some of the key excerpts from the analysis of the debate: HILLARY CLINTON SPENT MORE TIME ATTACKING, WHILE DONALD TRUMP SPENT MORE TIME DISCUSSING SOLUTIONS What do you think?

"AUSTIN, Tex. â€” One way to guarantee a strong reaction to the opening scene of your action comedy? Feature a slow-motion kitten.A cute cat runs through a drug-related gunfight in â€œKeanu,â€ the first film in which the comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, a.k.a. Key and Peele, share top billing. South by Southwest fans got a sneak peek at the film at a midnight screening over the weekend.The sketches from the starsâ€™ Comedy Central show, which frequently approached absurdity, often took on a life of their own online, generating hundreds of millions of YouTube views.So it was interesting to see how a real-life audience outside of the digital, shareable realm would respond to the teamâ€™s work.Before the screening, the two introduced the movie armed with stuffed kittens to throw into the crowd.Mr. Key said, â€œThis is the work-in-progress screening of â€˜Keanu,â€™ which basically means, if you like it, good, thatâ€™s the movie. If you donâ€™t, weâ€™re changing it so hard.â€Mr. Peele added, â€œIf you donâ€™t like it, itâ€™s just going to be â€˜John Wick 2.â€™â€Initially the audience laughed heartily at jokes stemming from that star-worthy kitten, and various gags involving the actors as none-too-streetwise characters pretending to be gangsters. But the energy in the room didnâ€™t stay as lively throughout and there were some lulls. A late screening time may have contributed, but the early reviews were mixed.Justin Chang at Variety called it â€œinitially amusing but fatally overstretched.â€ Eric Kohn at Indiewire said the movie â€œreturns to variations of the same punchlines again and again.â€ However, John DeFore at The Hollywood Reporter called it a â€œconsistently funny action-comedy.â€The finished film opens nationwide April 29.",1
"Saying he fears the number may be in the thousands or possibly even millions, U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez announced at a press conference Wednesday that he was horrified to learn some Americans are currently working jobs they do not truly enjoy. It has recently come to my attention that there are people in this very country who are not intensely passionate about what they do for a living, said a visibly alarmed Perez, adding that he was both shocked and distressed to learn that there are individuals in nearly every economic sector whose job is not a source of immense satisfaction and who do not feel deeply privileged to have it. As incredibly unsettling as this sounds, many of these folks will spend years, sometimes their entire career, simply going through the motions, rarely experiencing a sense of profound fulfillment after a days work. I cannot imagine earning a paycheck doing something other than what makes me happiest in life, but evidently that is the case for some truly unfortunate people out there. Perez went on to say he was equally disturbed to discover that many Americans are compensated with wages that do not cover the cost of the lifestyle they always dreamed of. ",0
"Considering the teams share a division, come from major metropolitan areas in relative proximity to one another, and the fact that it would just be nice to have a little something extra to play for, the Philadelphia 76ers reportedly asked the New York Knicks to be their rivals Monday. 'Could be kind of fun, right?' said 76ers forward Elton Brand, adding that his team can be the rivalry's underdog or vice versa, it doesn't really matter to him. 'I don't know, maybe during our next game one of us can foul you hard, and then you can get up in our faces and taunt our fans later on in the game? It doesn't matter how it starts. We'll make sure to say we hate you at the post-game press conference. You know, like a rivalry. We think people are really going to get into this.' Upon seeing new Knicks star Carmelo Anthony walk into the room, the 76ers pushed a reluctant Andre Iguodala up to him and forced Iguodala to brashly guarantee a win the next time they play. ",0
"Trump, morality and reality There has been a huge, emotional outpouring of doom and woe about the election of Donald Trump (Guardian Weekly digital edition, 11 November). It is probably much ado about nothing very different. In reality US presidents have very limited powers. Just ask Barack Obama. He never could close GuantÃ¡namo and it took him until his second term to get some modest health care reforms and an inadequate minimum wage. Trump will have many of the same disadvantages as a Democratic president because he is not really a member of the Republican establishment and they have few common values. He will most likely be in the position of an independent president and cannot rely on the support of Congress for good or bad initiatives. The main independent presidential power appears to be to commit aggression. George W Bush and Tony Blair killed a lot of innocent people. Obama and Clinton between them launched lots of bombs and drones and Clinton probably deserved the warmonger jibe that Trump threw at her. So why do we think he will be worse? Calm down, it will soon be business as usual.Ray Ferris Victoria, British Columbia, Canada â€¢ There is any amount of analysis of the disastrous outcome of the US presidential election, attempting to explain economic, political, sociological and psychological factors in the electorate. But there is something missing: the factor of individual moral responsibility. We should not confuse understanding with excusing. Consider each voter, standing privately in the voting booth, pencil hovering over the box next to the name â€œTrumpâ€; at that moment every single voter knows full well that this candidate is a predatory, misogynist, racist, narcissistic, demagogic bully, so if they choose to mark a vote for him they are demonstrating their collusion with him, effectively sharing some or all of those characteristics. There is absolutely no excuse for that individual act.Felix AnsellDreia, Portugal â€¢ Iâ€™ve come round to thinking that Trump is far cleverer than we all thought. His philosophy is to appeal to our worst â€œangelsâ€, our basest instincts, and then to rule us â€“ probably to everyoneâ€™s relief, by calling forth our better angels. Hillary and the elites operated the other way round.C LendonCanberra, ACT, Australia Political arrogance over trade I too thought that people power would end these EU free-trade deals (28Â October) and was sure that the hundreds of thousands of people who had demonstrated against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in September had convinced governments to give it second thoughts. Indeed, for me it seemed blindingly obvious that these deals are highly undesirable: they threaten environmental and social legislation, will nudge countless small- and medium-sized businesses into bankruptcy and leave governments wide open to malicious legal cases from powerful corporations. So I was deeply disappointed when Brussels browbeat the Walloons into agreeing to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada. Indeed, I was so affected by this that I ended up taking the train to Brussels to be there at the historic moment when our leaders â€œsigned awayâ€ our democracy. It was a sad affair outside the building with barbed wire and riot police present to keep just a handful of harmless demonstrators â€œat bayâ€. When politicians show this level of arrogance and just carry on regardless of strong public opinion, then it is any wonder that voters drift away to radical parties? I can see us arriving at a highly dangerous situation where even engaged, moderate voters either donâ€™t bother voting or decide to vote for â€œanything but the establishmentâ€.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany Empathy is universal As I always read the Guardian back to front, Owen Jonesâ€™s article on empathy (4 November) hit me in the face. Maybe it was the most important article in the issue because itâ€™s about every single one of us. Personally, my parents, whose ancestors came from all over Europe, brought me up in England, with the open door ethic. Our house was often buzzing with foreigners â€“ be they students, au pairs, distant relatives, friends of friends â€“ seeking temporary board and lodging. Just recently I welcomed Feras, a Syrian asylum seeker, into my home here in France, while he was getting his papers sorted out. He is now settled with his wife and children not too far from where I live, so I can keep up the new friendship. So, my advice to anyone who really has empathy and a spare bed, is to try sharing your living space with people fleeing war and strife: you then find out how enriching this simple gesture actually is.Lea YaunerPessac, France â€¢ Owen Jones argues admirably that â€œWe all possess a natural empathy for other human beings. But once we lose that, it is easy for injustice to flourishâ€. He is only repeating a founding principle of the three Abrahamic religions â€“ Judaism, Islam and Christianity. In this age of closing borders and hostility to refugees, let us remember that God tested Abraham by sending angels, disguised as travelling strangers. Without asking any questions (or checking their visas!) Abraham welcomed them in, washed their feet and gave them food and shelter. Constance Lever-TracyAdelaide, South Australia Human rights and wrongs With amusement and astonishment I read that Russia has lost its seat at the UNâ€™s human right council (4Â November). I agree that Russia, as a perpetual right abuser, shouldnâ€™t have a say in this. But it makes me wonder that Brazil, with its displacement of small-scale farmers for soy monoculture; Egypt, with thousands of protesters in prison; or civil-war Iraq made it into the circle. Not to mention the US or UK, which waged illegal wars, or Saudi Arabia with stoning and beheading by sword. Though it is badly needed, what is the use of such a council with such members?Steffen MÃ¼llerHastings, UK Easy business decision The choice for Nissanâ€™s management to invest in its UK Sunderland plant was really not much of a choice at all, even though it had to deal with two scenarios (4 November). On the one hand there was a relatively distant possibility of Brexit impacting negatively on Nissanâ€™s UK profits. On the other hand there is the 15% devaluation of the British pound against the euro and, in turn, a 15% extra profit for every Nissan car made in Sunderland and sold in the EU. As good management theory goes, one could predict the choice of Nissanâ€™s management, as profits, or what managerialism calls â€œshareholder valueâ€, remain imperative. In short, return on investment topped a rather illusory policy problem (Brexit) somewhat down the track. Nissanâ€™s choice was predictable. Easy, really.Thomas KlikauerSydney, Australia Cash is no longer king In response to Gaby Hinsliffâ€™s column about the future of cash (28 October): it is true that more people are using less cash and more cards. It is also true that the banks are beginning to try to close down branches, especially in small towns. So long as we go along with the dominance of massive global corporations and elect politicians who are obsequious valets to these corporations, her scenario seems logical. However, in Canada we have a local food movement that has drawn many people away from large companies, especially in the warm months, to purchase local food directly from farmers. It has been a boon to farmers and to public health as the food is largely organic. For the last four years I set up a locally based business. It was meant to sell the work of local artists and artisans but grew into a place to sell second-hand books, furniture and even antiques. Most of the money went to the suppliers who provided the goods. I made money by selling my own goods. Every penny spent in my shop meant that it was not being spent at the big box stores. So in these dark days when it seems that everything is run by large companies, it is up to us to find alternatives to retain a living, human economy that spreads the wealth. It wonâ€™t come from the top down.L MacDowellToronto, Canada â€¢ Gaby Hinsliffâ€™s article reminds me of my sonâ€™s experience on a New York-to-San Francisco flight. He attempted to buy a sandwich on board, but could only come up with cash, and they accepted only credit cards. Not having a credit card, he did not have a meal until he reached his destination. Plastic had more power than good old American cash. Other example include parking garages in downtown Portland that have signs that only credit cards will be accepted. I notice that Massachusetts is eliminating all toll booths in favour of credit drive-through. Who knows â€“ maybe the next time the tooth fairy comes, it will be leave a plastic card under your childâ€™s pillow.Fiorello VentrescoPortland, Maine, US Briefly â€¢ While Zoe Williams is writing about the European response to refugees (28 October), her language goes to the heart of the matter in describing whatâ€™s happening in Australia: men, women and children being held in offshore detention for years â€œfor the crime of needing helpâ€, and the â€œunfettered nastinessâ€ of the policy driving this situation. It raises the question of what we have come to as a nation.Wendy FlanneryBrisbane, South Australia â€¢ Thanks to Sport in brief (28 October) for the recognition of that rugby powerhouse the Cyprus Mouflons. The mighty All Blacks are still trying to beat several world records that they hold: the consecutive international wins you mention as 21, is actually 24 according to their website. Too bad that they were banned from participating in the 2015 World Rugby Cup on a technicality.Anthony WalterSurrey, British Columbia, Canada Email letters for publication to weekly.letters@theguardian.com",1
"9 Epic Failures of Regulating CryptographyCindy Cohn Weve seen this movie before. Below is a slightly adapted blog post from one we posted in 2010, the last time the FBI was seriously hinting that it was going to try to mandate that all communications systems be easily wiretappable by mandating back doors into any encryption systems. We marshaled eight epic failures of regulating crypto at that time, all of which are still salient today. And in honor of the current debate, weve added a ninth. They can promise strong encryption. They just need to figure out how they can provide us plain text. FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni, September 27, 2010 [W]ere in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption. The country needs it, industry needs it. We just want to make sure we have a trap door and key under some judges authority where we can get there if somebody is planning a crime. FBI Director Louis Freeh, May 11, 1995 If the government howls of protest at the idea that people will be using encryption sound familiar, its because regulating and controlling consumer use of encryption was a monstrous proposal officially declared dead in 2001 after threatening Americans privacy, free speech rights, and innovation for nearly a decade. But like a zombie, its now rising from the grave, bringing the same disastrous flaws with it. For those who werent following digital civil liberties issues in 1995, or for those who have forgotten, heres a refresher list of why forcing companies to break their own privacy and security measures by installing a back door was a bad idea 15 years ago: 1. It will create security risks. Dont take our word for it. Computer security expert Steven Bellovin has explained some of the problems. First, its hard to secure communications properly even between two parties. Cryptography with a back door adds a third party, requiring a more complex protocol, and as Bellovin puts it: Many previous attempts to add such features have resulted in new, easily exploited security flaws rather than better law enforcement access. It doesnt end there. Bellovin notes: Complexity in the protocols isnt the only problem; protocols require computer programs to implement them, and more complex code generally creates more exploitable bugs. In the most notorious incident of this type, a cell phone switch in Greece was hacked by an unknown party. The so-called lawful intercept mechanisms in the switch that is, the features designed to permit the police to wiretap calls easily was abused by the attacker to monitor at least a hundred cell phones, up to and including the prime ministers. This attack would not have been possible if the vendor hadnt written the lawful intercept code. More recently, as security researcher Susan Landau explains, an IBM researcher found that a Cisco wiretapping architecture designed to accommodate law-enforcement requirements a system already in use by major carriers had numerous security holes in its design. This would have made it easy to break into the communications network and surreptitiously wiretap private communications. The same is true for Google, which had its compliance technologies hacked by China. This isnt just a problem for you and me and millions of companies that need secure communications. What will the government itself use for secure communications? The FBI and other government agencies currently use many commercial products the same ones they want to force to have a back door. How will the FBI stop people from un-backdooring their deployments? Or does the government plan to stop using commercial communications technologies altogether? 2. It wont stop the bad guys. Users who want strong encryption will be able to get it from Germany, Finland, Israel, and many other places in the world where its offered for sale and for free. In 1996, the National Research Council did a study called Cryptographys Role in Securing the Information Society, nicknamed CRISIS. Heres what they said: Products using unescrowed encryption are in use today by millions of users, and such products are available from many difficult-to-censor Internet sites abroad. Users could pre-encrypt their data, using whatever means were available, before their data were accepted by an escrowed encryption device or system. Users could store their data on remote computers, accessible through the click of a mouse but otherwise unknown to anyone but the data owner, such practices could occur quite legally even with a ban on the use of unescrowed encryption. Knowledge of strong encryption techniques is available from official U.S. government publications and other sources worldwide, and experts understanding how to use such knowledge might well be in high demand from criminal elements. CRISIS Report at 303 None of that has changed. And of course, more encryption technology is more readily available today than it was in 1996. So unless the goverment wants to mandate that you are forbidden to run anything that is not U.S. government approved on your devices, they wont stop bad guys from getting access to strong encryption. 3. It will harm innovation. In order to ensure that no untappable technology exists, well likely see a technology mandate and a draconian regulatory framework. The implications of this for Americas leadership in innovation are dire. Could Mark Zuckerberg have built Facebook in his dorm room if hed had to build in surveillance capabilities before launch in order to avoid government fines? Would Skype have ever happened if it had been forced to include an artificial bottleneck to allow government easy access to all of your peer-to-peer communications?This has especially serious implications for the open source community and small innovators. Some open source developers have already taken a stand against building back doors into software. 4. It will harm US business. If, thanks to this proposal, US businesses cannot innovate and cannot offer truly secure products, were just handing business over to foreign companies who dont have such limitations. Nokia, Siemens, and Ericsson would all be happy to take a heaping share of the communications technology business from US companies. And its not just telecom carriers and VOIP providers at risk. Many game consoles that people can use to play over the Internet, such as the Xbox, allow gamers to chat with each other while they play. Theyd have to be tappable, too. 5. It will cost consumers. Any additional mandates on service providers will require them to spend millions of dollars making their technologies compliant with the new rules. And theres no real question about who will foot the bill: the providers will pass those costs onto their customers. (And of course, if the government were to pay for it, they would be using taxpayer dollars.) 6. It will be unconstitutional. Of course, we wouldnt be EFF if we didnt point out the myriad constitutional problems. The details of how a cryptography regulation or mandate will be unconstitutional may vary, but there are serious problems with nearly every iteration of a no encryption allowed proposal that weve seen so far. Some likely problems: 7. It will be a huge outlay of tax dollars. As noted below, wiretapping is still a relatively rare tool of government (at least for the FBI in domestic investigations the NSA is another matter as we now all know). Yet the extra tax dollars needed to create a huge regulatory infrastructure staffed with government bureaucrats who can enforce the mandates will be very high. So, the taxpayers would end up paying for more expensive technology, higher taxes, and lost privacy, all for the relatively rare chance that motivated criminals will act in the clear by not using encryption readily available from a German or Israeli company or for free online. 8. The government hasnt shown that encryption is a problem. How many investigations have been thwarted or significantly harmed by encryption that could not be broken? In 2009, the government reported only one instance of encryption that they needed to break out of 2,376 court-approved wiretaps, and it ultimately didnt prevent investigators from obtaining the communications they were after.This truth was made manifest in a recent Washington Post article written by an ex-FBI agent. While he came up with a scary kidnapping story to start his screed, device encryption simply had nothing to do with the investigation. The case involved an ordinary wiretap. In 2010, the New York Times reported that the government officials pushing for this have only come up with a few examples (and its not clear that all of the examples actually involve encryption) and no real facts that would allow independent investigation or confirmation. More examples will undoubtedly surface in the FBIs PR campaign, but well be watching closely to see if underneath all the scary hype theres actually a real problem demanding this expensive, intrusive solution. 9. Mobile devices are just catching up with laptops and other devices. Disk encryption just isnt that new. Laptops and desktop computers have long had disk encryption features that the manufacturers have absolutely no way to unlock. Even for simple screen locks with a user password, the device maker or software developer doesnt automatically know your password or have a way to bypass it or unlock the screen remotely.Although many law enforcement folks dont really like disk encryption on laptops and have never really liked it, and we understand that some lobbied against it in private, we havent typically heard them suggest in public that it was somehow improper for these vendors not to have a backdoor to their security measures.That makes us think that the difference here is really just that some law enforcement folks think that phones are just too popular and too useful to have strong security. But strong security is something we all should have. The idea that basic data security is just a niche product and that ordinary people dont deserve it is, frankly, insulting. Ordinary people deserve security just as much as elite hackers, sophisticated criminals, cops and government agents, all of whom have ready access to locks for their data. The real issue with encryption may simply be that the FBI has to use more resources when they encounter it than when they dont. Indeed, Bellovin argues: Time has also shown that the government has almost always managed to go around encryption. (One circumvention thats worked before: keyloggers.) But if the FBIs burden is the real issue here, then the words of the CRISIS Report are even truer today than they were in 1996: It is true that the spread of encryption technologies will add to the burden of those in government who are charged with carrying out certain law enforcement and intelligence activities. But the many benefits to society of widespread commercial and private use of cryptography outweigh the disadvantages. The mere fact that law enforcements job may become a bit more difficult is not a sufficient reason for undermining the privacy and security of hundreds of millions of innocent people around the world who will be helped by mobile disk encryption. Or as Chief Justice of John Roberts recently observed in another case rejecting law enforcements broad demands for access to the information available on our mobile phones: Privacy comes at a cost.

"Decrying the conditions of their incarceration as excessively harsh and inhumane, a leading prisoner advocacy group on Monday officially condemned the treatment of supervillains currently held in the nations impenetrable magnetic detainment cubes. In a strongly worded statement to the press, members of the Justice Project expressed outrage at the U.S. prison systemwhich typically keeps supercriminals physically restrained with stasis waves during their interminable stays in magnetically sealed hexahedronsand claimed that the punishment inflicted upon these nefarious individuals constitutes a gross violation of both international law and universal humanitarian principles. What these supervillains endure while being held inside detention cubes within the cavernous underground silos of this countrys top-secret military compounds is absolutely deplorable, said Justice Project director Mary Sorenson, noting that the nations detained nemeses often have their hands painfully bound by manacles of pure tungsten and spend 24 hours a day on full lockdown behind invisible force fields. These individuals are kept in perpetual solitary confinement, with neither sound nor daylight allowed to permeate the walls of their hermetic isolation chambers as they angrily vow vengeance on their captors. We cannot stand by and allow this to continue, she added. Whatever their crimes against mankind, these diabolical villains dont deserve to be abused and degraded while fully immobilized by plasma beams and encircled by rings of swirling photon energy. Sorenson said her team has observed numerous cases of supercriminals being subjected to prison conditions that threaten both their physical well-being and their precarious, already-deranged mental states. Specifically, the reform advocate lamented the cerebral strain inflicted by neural control chips that allow offenders to be incapacitated at a moments notice, as well as the emotional trauma caused by being detained indefinitely and completely alone in a transdimensional vortex. The group also denounced corrections facilities in which evildoers are routinely pinioned within the heart of a raging volcano or forced to fight for survival after being jettisoned onto the surface of a distant prison planet. Furthermore, the Justice Project has long critiqued the cruel and highly unusual practice of maintaining a high-frequency sonic disruptor field over supervillain cell blocks to disable the malefactors telepathic powers, calling this method an affront to basic superhuman rights. You simply cannot place a cold-blooded mad genius inside a matter-bending gyroscope that spins him into an alternate reality and expect him to undergo any kind of substantive rehabilitation during his 2,000-year exile in the Phantom Zone, said Sorenson, noting that reducing convicts to the size of a thimble using a shrinking ray and placing them within the walls of a miniature holding colony constitutes a flagrant breach of the Geneva Conventions. If we treat someone like that, just imagine what astoundingly evil crimes hes going to commit when, inevitably, he gets out. Besides, if we as a society approve of such torture, then truly we are no better than the sinister individuals constantly scheming to kidnap the leaders of the United Nations or set fire to the Isle of Manhattan with their minds, she added. Reached for comment, top corrections officials defended their methods, admitting that measures such as injecting supervillains with a powerful serum that overrides their malicious instincts or trapping them deep within the molten core of the earth may be severe, but are nevertheless vital to the nations security. These are violent, unpredictable lunatics with superhuman strength and cunning were dealing with here, said George England, chief warden at the Claustrum Detention Facility in the Mojave Desert, who supports his prisons controversial policy of transporting inmates forward in time to a point at which the planet is a barren wasteland lacking food and water. Sure, some people want us to coddle these villains by allowing them to pace back and forth behind 2-foot-thick Plexiglas, but you do that, and the next thing you know theyve used their psionic energy to pull the guns out of the guards holsters and escape through a smoldering hole in the ceiling. Then its the Judgment Hour all over again. Well, Im not about to allow that on my watch.

"Richard Karl, a 47-year-old assembly-line worker at Quaker Oats' Cap'n Crunch With Crunchberries plant in De Kalb, was fired Monday following an 'Oops! All Berries' mishap.' 'This cereal is supposed to have a yellow-piece-to-Crunchberry ratio of 4:1,' Quaker spokeswoman Melissa Dyer said. 'But Mr. Karl failed to pull the lever that sends the yellow bits down the chute into the big funnel, so there aren't any in Monday's entire batch of cereal. It's all Crunchberries.' Added Dyer: 'What are we going to do with all these boxes of pure Crunchberries? You'd have to really love Crunchberries to want to eat these.' ",0
"The Singapore retail industry is hoping for a little something extra in its Christmas stocking this year, local media reported on Monday. Stores are expecting to grow their sales by up to 15 percent this holiday season compared to last year, thanks to a stronger economy as well as the droves of tourists making their way to Singapore, local daily The Business Times reported. The general sentiment on the premier shopping belt is that sales this year will surpass last year. Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands, which opened their doors this year, have also helped power the tourism industry, which should help Singapore draw some 12 million visitors in 2010. Local major retailer Tangs is projecting holiday sales to climb 10 percent year- on-year. And electronics chain Best Denki is targeting an 8-12 percent spike in sales during the festive season, going by sales receipts so far. The hotel industry is also benefiting from the surge in tourist traffic. 'The pick-up rate for rooms over the Christmas season this year increased by 10 percent compared to the same period in 2009, and 20 percent compared to 2008,' a Mandarin Oriental spokesman said. ",1
"Cop Hating Race Baiter Beyonce Gets Rude Awakening When She Steps On Stage At CMAs Country music fans were shocked when they learned that Beyonce would be performing at the Country Music Awards. In fact, millions of patriots were outraged that the organization would let a Clinton-supporting, anti-police advocate perform at the event. Country star Kenny Chesney did not even attempt to mask his anger. The IJ Review quickly pointed out that Chesney looked unimpressed through the whole performance, and one viewer was even able to capture it on film. In case you missed it, watch the clip below: Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) November 3, 2016 Chesney was honored last night with the Pinnacle Award, in recognition of his contributions to country music. Its no wonder he was outraged to see a non-country, anti-American celebrity perform. He wasnt the only one who was outraged by her performance.

"Indonesian police are hunting 26 prisoners who escaped from a jail in restive Papua province on the weekend after most of their guards failed to report for duty, an official said Monday. The prisoners including robbers and rapists used a rope to scale a four-metre (13-foot) outer wall at Abepura prison, Jayapura district, on Saturday, Abepura prison chief Liberti Sitinjak told selfnews. 'I'm extremely embarrassed. Our officers are not disciplined. Only three of the seven guards turned up for duty that day,' he said. 'The prison isn't properly secured... the wire fence separating the wall and building is damaged so the prisoners could run away easily.' He said more prisoners were 'waiting their turn' to climb the wall when guards finally spotted them and put an end to the breakout. Eighteen other inmates escaped from the same prison last month amid reports of a bitter rivalry between wardens over who should be running the jail. Police have set up roadblocks around Jayapura and along the border with Papua New Guinea in a bid to catch the escapees. 'We're also carrying out an internal investigation to see if our officers were unprofessional and need to be expelled,' Sitinjak said. Indonesia's prison system is riddled with corruption, drug abuse and disease, according to independent monitors. Human rights experts say inmates in Papua, including political prisoners, are often abused and tortured. Papua's ethnic Melanesian majority has waged a low-level separatist insurgency for decades but foreign reporters and aid workers are denied access to investigate claims of genocide and crimes against humanity.

"AMES, Iowa â€” â€œUNBECOMING.â€ â€œMiss Congeniality.â€ Not sufficiently â€œladylike.â€ In politics, these words and phrases have long been used to belittle female candidates. But now, female politicians are increasingly trying to rethink â€”Â and reclaim â€”Â how language shapes how they are perceived.Recently, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, trained her sights on a single word â€” â€œladylike.â€ â€œLadylike,â€ Ms. McCaskill told an audience at Iowa State University last month, means, â€œSpeak out, be strong, take charge, change the worldâ€ â€” all traits she thinks female leaders, or even the first female president, should have, and characteristics she believes are â€œvery, very ladylike.â€ The term had a very different meaning when, during her 2012 re-election campaign, her opponent, Todd Akin, then a representative, described her performance during a debate as not particularly â€œladylike,â€ and â€œvery aggressive.â€Ms. McCaskill joins a long line of powerful women who are trying to use gender-based words to their advantage. Bella S. Abzug, a feminist and antiwar activist, first ran for Congress in 1970 with the slogan â€œThis womanâ€™s place is in the House â€” the House of Representatives!â€In 2002, when Mitt Romney ran for governor of Massachusetts against Shannon Oâ€™Brien and described her debate performance as â€œunbecoming,â€ Ms. Oâ€™Brien derided him as a sexist, and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Teresa Heinz Kerry held a rally on her behalf, praising all the â€œunbecoming womenâ€ who turned out in support. And Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, began her political career after a state lawmaker dismissed her as â€œjust a mom in tennis shoes.â€ The insult prompted Ms. Murray to run for the Senate â€” and she adopted â€œmom in tennis shoesâ€ as a campaign motto she still uses.â€œThe history of social movements is full of things that were a pejorative being reclaimed,â€ said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. â€œItâ€™s a powerful means of subverting the original use, and it invites reflection on the intention of the original use. Itâ€™s a jujitsu move.â€Ms. McCaskill said she hoped that reclaiming the word â€œladylikeâ€ would encourage more women to run for office. The â€œladylikeâ€ message is one she said she wished she had heard as a young woman.â€œI wanted to be validated in the fact that I had ambition and the fact that I was aggressive about the things I believed in and that I was highly opinionated,â€ Ms. McCaskill said in an interview. â€œI wanted someone to tell me that it was not only O.K. but it was terrific, and I think the more of us that reinforce that message, the more women weâ€™re going to have running for president in the next decade.â€Some are pushing back in other ways. In the corporate world, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, recently began a â€œBan Bossyâ€ campaign with the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., to discourage the use of a word she says is used to put down assertive young girls.As women increasingly take on high-profile roles in politics â€” the current 113th Congress boasts a record number of women, with 20 in the Senate and 82 in the House â€” scholars and campaign operatives say attacking sexism head-on is likely to become a more common, and effective, tactic.â€œThe more female candidates there are, the easier it is for any individual one of them to talk about these issues and try to find new ways of dealing with it,â€ said Deborah Tannen, a linguist at Georgetown University.Sexist statements also can be used to rally the base. The day that Mr. Akin made his comments about â€œlegitimate rape,â€ Emilyâ€™s List, a political action committee that backs female candidates who support abortion rights, raised $280,000 off his remarks.â€œWe know that running a campaign on being a woman isnâ€™t the way to win, but that thereâ€™s a way to turn around sexist attacks and use it as a sticking point to drive home your agenda,â€ said Marcy Stech, national press secretary at Emilyâ€™s List.Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said that research she had done as part of â€œName It, Change It,â€ a nonpartisan project to end sexist coverage of female candidates, found that while sexist coverage hurt female politicians, responding to it could benefit them. Sometimes, even the mere hint of sexism is enough to hurt the candidate perpetrating the language. As a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama faced a swift backlash after he quipped that Mrs. Clinton was â€œlikable enoughâ€ during a debate. And Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, was called â€œMiss Congenialityâ€ and a â€œprom queenâ€ by her male opponent and his campaign team during her 2012 re-election fight, comments she largely chose to ignore. â€œI think it worked to my advantage because the people in Minnesota decided how they felt about it themselves,â€ Ms. Klobuchar said.Many Republicans dismiss the so-called war on women, arguing that their partyâ€™s economic agenda is one that will appeal to women. But Katie Packer Gage, a founder of Burning Glass, a team of all-female political operatives working with Republicans on messaging to women, nonetheless offers a warning to Republican candidates: â€œThe Democrats are going to try to manufacture a Todd Akin moment,â€ she said.The current effort to aggressively confront sexism, said Ms. Lake, the Democratic pollster, has taken on a newfound urgency with the possibility of a Hillary Clinton candidacy.â€œA lot of Democratic women are really eager to call this out now because they want to create a different kind of environment for Hillary to run in,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s just like, â€˜This is our candidate, this is our leader, and weâ€™re just not going to take it anymore.â€™Â â€",1
"Prominent Chinese intellectuals and writers have signed a petition calling for the release of a well-known ethnic Uighur economist in Beijing who was apparently detained last week during a bloody outbreak of ethnic violence in western China. The economist, Ilham Tohti, 39, who had written critically about government policies toward the Uighurs, is the best known person to be detained so far in relation to the ethnic strife. Tohti, a professor at the Central University for Nationalities, vanished from his Beijing home sometime last week and made a call to a friend to say he would be detained. Tohti ran a Web site called Uighur Online, which had become a popular forum for discussion of issues important to the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking ethnic group of mostly Sunni Muslims that is the largest in oil-rich Xinjiang, China's biggest administrative region. The site is now blocked in China. Ethnic tensions between the Uighurs and the Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, exploded last week after a Uighur protest on July 5 in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, turned violent when riot police officers tried to halt the rally. Uighur mobs rampaged through the city, killing many Han civilians and setting fire to cars and buildings. For days afterward, Han mobs with sticks and knives attacked and killed Uighurs. The government says at least 184 people were killed and 1,680 injured, the vast majority being Han. But many Uighurs in Urumqi say that count does not include hundreds of Uighurs killed by security forces or by Han vigilantes. The state news agency reported Monday that police officers shot dead two armed Uighurs and wounded a third. On July 6, Nur Bekri, the governor of Xinjiang, said in a speech that Uighur Online had helped instigate the rioting by spreading rumors. Chinese officials insist that Uighurs abroad and some inside China were responsible for starting the violence. The officials avoid any discussion of systemic problems in Xinjiang that have led to deep-rooted resentment among many Uighurs: the large numbers of Han migrating to Xinjiang in the past decades and taking jobs, for example, or the restrictions on religious practice. Tohti had been increasingly critical of the lack of jobs for Uighurs and policies that encouraged the influx of Han settlers. 'Unemployment among Uighurs is among the highest in the world,' he said in an interview in March with Radio Free Asia, which is supported by the U.S. government. While doing research for the Chinese government at one point in the 1990s, Tohti said, he discovered that there were 1.5 million unemployed workers in Xinjiang. The petition to free Tohti was started by Wang Lixiong, one of China's leading experts on ethnic minority issues and the husband of Woeser, a well-known Tibetan blogger. The petition had 158 signatures early Wednesday. The signers are mostly ethnic Han and from all over China. One of the signers, Ran Yunfei, a well-known magazine editor and blogger who is of Monguor, or Tu, ethnicity, said in a telephone interview: 'Even if we don't have democracy, we should have freedom of speech. And they should not detain someone for his remarks. As far as I know, Professor Ilham's Web site is a very gentle and rational one.' In the radio interview in March, Tohti said he was concerned about being imprisoned for his writings. 'Of course I worry, but what I have said doesn't conflict with Chinese law,' he said. 'If they put me in jail, I am ready. I've sat in front of a computer for so many years. Jail would give me a chance to exercise and lose weight.' ",1

"Victory! DOJ Forces Feds to Obtain Warrants to Spy on Cellphones with Stingray SurveillanceBy Jay Syrompoulos The new guidelines, implemented September 3, require all federal law enforcement agencies, as well as all state and local agencies working in concert with a federal investigation, to obtain a search warrant from a judge before being allowed to deploy the device. These much-needed policy changes came after journalists and activists worked tirelessly to investigate and expose the use of these devices, often without a warrant, by federal and state law enforcement agencies. The Stingray device works by mimicking a legitimate cell phone tower, thus fooling cell phones in the area into connecting to the police controlled device. This enables law enforcement to access the unique identifying number for every phone in the proximity of the instrument, and then track a phones location in real-time. Additionally, the devices have the capability to route the traffic of all phones in the vicinity through the Stingray. This allows agents the option of recording entire calls, intercepting texts, or even selectively denying service to particular phones. Investigations across the nation have revealed the extensive use of the technology by federal, state and local law enforcement. It was subsequently revealed that state and local law enforcement agencies were allowed to procure this technology from the FBI and Harris Corporation, makers of the Stingray and related devices. However, they were bound by strict non-disclosure agreements, which prevented any modicum of transparency or accountability. Think about that for a second. The FBI and Harris Corporation gave the police a device that can intercept and record peoples phone calls, text messages and data, but only allowed them the technology if they signed an agreement that didnt allow them to tell anyone that they were using the device, including judges. Does this sound like a justice system?? In holding to their agreements, law enforcement went so far to protect the secret use of the device that there were numerous cases in which charges were dropped rather than answer a judges questions that would potentially reveal the use of the device. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation: What todays changes do: What todays changes dont do: While this is a good first step towards providing transparency and accountability in the use of this technology, the fact that this directive covers only federal agencies remains problematic. Many state and local law enforcement agencies continue to attempt to conceal their use of the devices in criminal investigations. There is still virtually nothing, aside from vigilant judges, keeping the warrantless evidence gathered using the Stingray from being presented as evidence in state courts. Without there being any established law regulating the devices use, compliance with the Fourth Amendments warrant requirement seems like an extremely arbitrary choice, without any real enforcement mechanism to hold violators accountable. The only way to control the rampant and unconstitutional use of this, and similar technologies, is to make an example out of police agencies that choose to flout the Fourth Amendment. They need to be held criminally liable under the law when using the device illicitly or attempting to conceal its use from trial court judges. The warrant requirement should include all state and local law enforcement agencies around the country, similar to that of Washington, which already has laws in place requiring a warrant. The idea that we need a state law to tell the cops to follow the U.S. Constitutions Fourth Amendments warrant requirement seems patently absurd. Perhaps we need to ask ourselves a larger question; why does law enforcement feel as though they have a right violate innocent Americas constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure? The time has come for law enforcement nationwide to get the message: if you want to use a Stingray, you need to get a warrant!

He is currently a graduate student at University of Denver pursuing a masters in Global Affairs.

"Sean Hannity On The Brink Of Being Fired By Fox News... He Needs Your Support Now More Than Ever Fox News reporter Sean Hannity has come under fire recently for deciding to exercise his Constitutional right to free speech by appearing in an ad for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Executives at the network were quick to address the situation, claiming that did not know of or support Hannitys endorsement. We were not aware of Sean Hannity participating in a promotional video and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season, the press release read. Of course, fans of the network were angered by Foxs attempts to stifle Hannitys right of free speech. And Hannity stood up to defend himself. Heres a website, ThinkProgress, remember they did the structural imbalance of talk radio so many years ago? And then they did this hit piece, Hannity Interviewed Donald Trump 21 Times, And Never Made News, or something to that effect, which is just not true, Hannity commented. And they picked some of the easier questions that I asked Donald Trump, which they could have done with any other candidate that I have interviewed. Ill be honest, Im not sitting hereIf Im interviewing Hillary Clinton, its gonna be a hundred times harder than any Republican, because I believe the Republicans represent, and have a far better vision, one that I agree with. What do you think? Do you support Hannity for speaking his mind? ",0
"TE ATATU, New Zealand â€” New Zealand is as beautiful as it is isolated. We live a long way from anyone and anything, and we like it that way. We have almost four and a half million people and more than five million dairy cows. We have snow-capped mountains and deep dark woods where hobbits roam, as directed by Peter Jackson in his interminable â€œLord of the Ringsâ€ movies. We sing (Lorde) and act (Russell Crowe) and throw stuff (rugby balls).The rest of the world rarely notices our country, but this month everyone â€” well, some people â€” seems to be taking note. Our green and pleasant archipelago is heading to the polls for a national referendum on whether or not to do away with our current flag and replace it with something that kind of looks like a beach towel.The redesigned flag â€” a white fern leaf laid over a black-and-blue background â€” looks happy and foolish, not unlike our prime minister, John Key. The head of New Zealandâ€™s government likewise has a floppy, casual charm. This is the guy whose biggest scandal came after a waitress told the world about his strange, compulsive habit of pulling her by the ponytail every time he visited her cafe.Unlike the flag, the prime minister resonates with voters: Heâ€™s won the last three elections. Mr. Key has driven the flag-change proposal. Itâ€™s his passion, his grand project. But many people here loathe the prospect â€” heâ€™s been in office almost eight years, and all we got was this lousy flag? â€” and wish the whole thing would just go away. It will soon. The referendum, which began March 3, ends March 24.New Zealandâ€™s current flag was adopted in 1902. Our Olympic athletes compete under it; it flies atop our Parliament. It has served us in two world wars and is carried at somber dawn parades up and down the country when we commemorate those who died in combat in a moving ceremony that concludes with the line: â€œWe will remember them.â€ These are the kinds of connections that New Zealanders want to keep.But a corner of the flag features the Union Jack, a reference to our former status as a British colony. Critics â€” and Mr. Key is hardly alone on this, although neither is he surrounded â€” point out that this is an anachronism. Itâ€™s the silver fern that really is our national symbol, an emblem from nature, proudly displayed on the jersey of our Godlike national rugby team, the All Blacks.Itâ€™s not an entirely terrible idea to have a new flag, or even to put a silver fern on it. But the way Mr. Key and the flag consideration panel â€” the flag consideration panel! â€” have gone about it has been pretty much entirely terrible.First, the public was invited to design a new flag. The panel received 10,292 designs and then drew up a list of 40 contenders before unveiling a shortlist of five. Mr. Key had spoken at length about wanting a silver fern. Three of the five featured â€” golly! â€” a silver fern, and two were by the same person, Kyle Lockwood, whose designs looked pretty much exactly like each other. One nation under two beach towels.Since he was elected prime minister in 2008, Mr. Key has generally enjoyed remarkably high levels of public support. He can do no wrong. Pull a ponytail, and the public just says, â€œSo what?â€ But the tide never came in on the flag-change proposal. Polls have always heavily favored keeping the existing flag.The cost of the exercise might have been a factor. The government spent an estimated 25.7 million New Zealand dollars on asking the public to change a flag it doesnâ€™t want changed. Mailing ballot papers took up the greatest chunk of cash, with 17.3 million New Zealand dollars. The splendidly specific figure of 208,500 New Zealand dollars was spent on sending the flag consideration panel â€” the flag consideration panel! â€” around the country to hold â€œpublic workshopsâ€ without the publicâ€™s being all that keen on attending.There were 25 public meetings. The average crowd was 30. Ten people came to the meeting in Christchurch and eight attended in New Plymouth. In fairness, there were other things on in both cities those nights, for instance staying indoors and staring at the wall. As for the panel members, they received 640 New Zealand dollars per day. The chairman, John Burrows, a law professor, must be a superior human. He earned 850 New Zealand dollars per day.One of the two silver fern beach towels designed by Kyle Lockwood won the public vote to go head to head with our old flag. Which looks set to win in the referendum? It would be lame to say the answer is blowing in the wind, because the answer appears to be fairly obvious. In a recent opinion poll, 63 percent wanted to keep the current flag. Mr. Key must be tearing his hair out â€” or someone elseâ€™s.",1
"The Obama administration has taken the extraordinary step of authorizing the targeted killingof an American citizen, the radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who is believed to have shifted from encouraging attacks on the United States to directly participating in them, intelligence and counterterrorism officials said Tuesday. Al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico and spent years in the United States as an imam, is in hiding in Yemen. He has been the focus of intense scrutiny since he was linked to Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in November, and then to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. 25. American counterterrorism officials say al-Awlaki is an operative of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the affiliate of the terror network in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. They say they believe that he has become a recruiter for the terrorist network, feeding prospects into plots aimed at the United States and at Americans abroad, the officials said. It is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for an American to be approved for targeted killing, officials said. A former senior legal official in the administration of George W. Bush said he did not know of any American who was approved for targeted killing under the former president. But the director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, told a House hearing in February that such a step was possible. 'We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community,' he said. 'If we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that.' He did not name al-Awlaki as a target. The step taken against al-Awlaki, which occurred earlier this year, is a vivid illustration of his rise to prominence in the constellation of terrorist leaders. But his popularity as a cleric, whose lectures on Islamic scripture have a large following among English-speaking Muslims, means any action against him could rebound against the United States in the larger ideological campaign against al-Qaida. The possibility that al-Awlaki might be added to the target list was reported by The Los Angeles Times in January, and Reuters reported Tuesday that he was approved for capture or killing. People on the target list are considered to be military enemies of the United States and therefore not subject to the ban on political assassination first approved by President Gerald R. Ford. ",1
"20 Signs That The Pharmaceutical Companies Are Running A 280 Billion Dollar Money Making ScamMichael Snyder In America today, the number of people hooked on legal drugs absolutely dwarfs the number of people hooked on illegal drugs. And, sadly, the number of people killed by legal drugs absolutely dwarfs the number of people killed by illegal drugs. But most Americans assume that if a drug is legal that it must be safe. After all, the big pharmaceutical companies and the federal government would never allow us to take anything that would hurt us, right? Sadly, the truth is that they dont really care about us. They dont really care that prescription painkillers are some of the most addictive drugs on the entire planet and that they kill more Americans each year than heroin and cocaine combined. They dont care that antidepressants are turning tens of millions of Americans into zombies and can significantly increase the chance of suicide (just look at the warning label). All the big pharmaceutical companies really care about is making as much money as they possibly can. The following are 20 signs that the pharmaceutical companies are running a $280 billion money making scam #1 According to a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic, 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug. An astounding 20 percent of all Americans are on at least five prescription drugs. #2 According to the CDC, approximately 9 out of every 10 Americans that are at least 60 years of age say that they have taken at least one prescription drug within the last month. #3 The 11 largest pharmaceutical companies combined to rake in approximately $85,000,000,000 in profits in 2012. #5 According to Alternet, last year 11 of the 12 new-to-market drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were priced above $100,000 per-patient per-year. #6 The CDC says that spending on prescription drugs more than doubled between 1999 and 2008. #7 Many prescription drugs cost about twice as much in the United States as they do in other countries. #8 One study found that more than 20 percent of all American adults are taking at least one drug for psychiatric or behavioral disorders. #9 The percentage of women taking antidepressants in America is higher than in any other country in the world. #10 Children in the United States are three times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than children in Europe are. #11 A shocking Government Accountability Office report discovered that approximately one-third of all foster children in the United States are on at least one psychiatric drug. In fact, the report found that many states seem to be doping up foster children as a matter of course. Just check out these stunning statistics In Texas, foster children were 53 times more likely to be prescribed five or more psychiatric medications at the same time than non-foster children. In Massachusetts, they were 19 times more likely. In Michigan, the number was 15 times. It was 13 times in Oregon. And in Florida, foster children were nearly four times as likely to be given five or more psychotropic medications at the same time compared to non-foster children. #12 In 2010, the average teen in the U.S. was taking 1.2 central nervous system drugs. Those are the kinds of drugs which treat conditions such as ADHD and depression. #13 The total number of Americans taking antidepressants doubled between 1996 and 2005. #14 All of those antidepressants dont seem to be working too well. The suicide rate for Americans between the ages of 35 and 64 rose by close to 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. The number of Americans that are killed by suicide now exceeds the number of Americans that die as a result of car accidents. #15 According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 36 million Americans have abused prescription drugs at some point in their lives. #16 A survey conducted for the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that more than 15 percent of all U.S. high school seniorsabuse prescription drugs. #17 According to the CDC,approximately three quarters of a million people a year are rushed to emergency rooms in the United Statesbecause of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs. #18 According to the Los Angeles Times, drug deaths (mostly caused by prescription drugs) are climbing at an astounding rate. Drug fatalities more than doubled among teens and young adults between 2000 and 2008, years for which more detailed data are available. Deaths more than tripled among people aged 50 to 69, the Times analysis found. In terms of sheer numbers, the death toll is highest among people in their 40s. #19 In the United States today, prescription painkillers kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined. #20 Each year, tens of billions of dollars is spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States alone. The American people deserve better than that. Every year, the United States spends more on health care than Japan, Germany, France, China, the U.K., Italy, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Australia combined. In fact, if the U.S. health care system was a separate nation it would be the 6th largest economy on the entire planet. For all the money that we spend, we should be the healthiest people in the world by a wide margin. Instead, life expectancy is higher in dozens of other countries and we have very high rates of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

"The overcriminalization problem: Congressional Research Service cant even list all federal crimesMadison Ruppert The federal governments approach to criminalizing just about everything reminds me of how that same entity contends that just about everything is an indicator of potential terrorist activity. Similarly, public schools have turned typical childhood behavior into a punishable offense. The problem of overcriminalization has now spread beyond the unknown number of offenses outlined in the federal criminal code into your local school, homeland security agencies and more. Indeed, the number is so incredibly massive, that the Congressional Research Service told a congressional task force that they simply did not have the manpower and resources required to create a tally of all criminal offenses outlined in the federal criminal code. According to Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), Today, there are roughly 4,500 federal crimes on the books. And still many more regulations and rules that, if not abided by, result in criminal penalties, including incarceration. The problem with a significant number of these offenses is that one can commit them without ever meaning to do so or with any knowledge of wrongdoing. Harvey Silverglate, a practicing attorney in Boston, Massachusetts, newspaper columnist, and civil liberties advocate, detailed this disturbing fact in his book, Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent. Sensenbrenner confirms Silverglates point in stating, Americans must contend with literally thousands of obscure and cumbersome federal regulations, a simple misreading or ignorance of a regulation can land a person in prison. Molly M. Gill, government affairs counsel for Families Against Mandatory Minimums points out some of the massive problems facing Americans thanks to overcriminalization in a video released by the Cato Institute: In the video, the Constitutional doctrine of nondelegation is mentioned. Nondelegation is a doctrine which is central to the separation of powers in the Constitution. It essentially holds that the US Congress cannot delegate legislative power to any other government entities, since Congress alone is given all legislative powers by the Constitution. In case law, it has been determined that when Congress instructs government agencies to regulate, it must give those agencies an intelligible principle on which to base their regulations. This doctrine allows agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which is heavily involved in electronic and physical surveillance to carry out their activities. However, as the interviewer from Cato points out, the doctrine of nondelegation is, effectively, as far as I understand it, dead. I think the temptation to regulate is very great at the federal level, Gill said. Its a difficult temptation to resist. I think thats true in the area of criminalization too. If theres a problem, lets make it a crime, lets slap a mandatory minimum sentence on it and well fix the problem, Gill said. Its an easy way out and sometimes it gets around some of the solutions which are probably better long term but harder to choose and harder to implement. Individuals in the federal government apparently fail to resist this temptation on a regular basis. That was highlighted when Sensenbrenner said that the Congressional Research Service (CRS) could not muster the manpower to update the calculation of criminal offenses in the federal code since it was last done in 2008. CRSs initial response to our request was that they lack the manpower and resources to accomplish this task, Sensenbrenner said last month. I think this confirms the point that all of us have been making on this issue and demonstrates the breadth of overcriminalization. Ultimately, one of the most significant problems, and one that is raised in the above video, is the elimination of mens rea in the criminal code. Unfortunately, many regulatory crimes improperly define the elements of criminality, including omitting or improperly defining the appropriate level of criminal intent, Sensenbrenner stated. Without this appropriate level of criminal intent, or mens rea, defined in the code, one can accidentally break a law and face federal criminal penalties for doing so. Overcriminalization is a serious problem facing America, especially since we already have the highest prison population rate in the world, beating out every other Western country by leaps and bounds.

"1) Nick Cusack, Fulham 1-0 Scarborough (Endsleigh League Division Three, 13 January 1996)   Related: The Joy of Six: terrible football penalties   Twitter is the root cause of world gone wrong, in our heart we all know that, but it does have one thing to commend it: the Crap 90s Football feed is the most reliable comedy since Larry David went into hibernation. It is full of clips of utter ineptitude from primeval swine with more hair on the bottom than the top; itâ€™s a world in which a goalmouth scramble can morph seamlessly into a goalmouth rumble; a world full of goals so comically bad that they would give Tubes an instant orgasm.  The lower-league stuff is particularly endearing. If you look up synonyms of â€˜crapâ€™, one of them is â€˜Endsleigh Leagueâ€™. (We jest of course. These people were infinitely better at football than we will ever be, which makes their scruffy endeavour all the more amusing.) Everyone will have their own favourite, but the Joy of Six has a soft spot for Nick Cusackâ€™s goal against Scarborough. In truth the goal belongs to the keeper Ian Ironside, who goes to preposterous lengths to save a corner, and then compounds his original misjudgement not once but twice by chasing after the ball, diligently digging a deeper hole. In his defence, he did save the corner.  A warm welcome to new follower @safc. Do you still play football like this? pic.twitter.com/403w3Gqe9eâ€” Crap 90s Football (@Crap90sFootball) October 6, 2016   2) Jason Cundy, Ipswich 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur (Premier League, 30 August 1992) Sometimes defence is the best form of attack. There is a sub-genre of comedy goal â€“ also featuring Scott Nisbetâ€™s legendary offspinner that almost helped Rangers to to the Champions League â€“ that comes from nothing more than a defender doing his job with a crunching tackle or interception that somehow ends with the ball in the net. When he walloped a clearance over Craig Forrest from 50 yards, Minder villain Jason Cundy broke into a confused growl, as if he didnâ€™t know whether he should celebrate or not. If only he had a better poker face, or he wasnâ€™t renowned for his rustic style of play, he might have been able to claim he meant it. In that parallel universe, it was as life-changing as David Beckhamâ€™s goal from the halfway line. He is now best mates with Tom Cruise; he is marred to her out of En Vogue; his aftershave, Intimately Cundy, is available in all good discount aftershave stores; his film, Crack It Like Cundy, was â€œpure exuberant fun!â€ according to Roger Ebert; and you donâ€™t need to ask which branded H&M underpants the Joy of Six is wearing today. (See also: spare a thought for Peter Litchfield. To be beaten once by a beastly up-and-under from the halfway line may be regarded as misfortune...)    3) Roberto Boninsegna, Brazil 4-1 Italy (World Cup final, 21 June 1970) Brazil 1970s are the greatest attacking team of all time, so itâ€™s no surprise they are responsible for the greatest video on YouTube. Itâ€™s not what you might think however: this collection of their incompetence during the tournament, soundtracked by the jauntily sinister Trololo, will never cease to release endorphins. In aiming so high they plumbed some glorious depths, none lower than Italyâ€™s goal in the final. After some freestyle faffing, their No5 put the clod in Clodoaldo with an absurd backheel that allowed Boninsegna to lumber towards goal. What followed was like a Benny Hill football sketch, and a magnificent fiasco on the grandest stage. Brazil, and especially Clodoaldo, just about redeemed themselves in the second half.    4) Mike Hanke, Schalke 04 2-3 Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga, 17 April 2004) You know what they say: you are never more vulnerable than when youâ€™ve just scored. Thatâ€™s particularly true if you are a goalkeeper who has just scored a penalty, like Hans-Jorg Butt, and are off on a lap of honour, thinking about what youâ€™ll call your world tour, while the opposition are about to kick off. You can make your own gags. The Butt of all the jokes; Butt made an arse of himself; the Butt stops here, about 30 yards from his own goal, drinking in the adulation as the ball sails slowly over his head and into the net.    5) Brian McClair, Sheffield Wednesday 3-2 Manchester United, (Division One, 26 October 1991) This is the kind of goal for which the phrase â€œthey all countâ€ was invented. Itâ€™s best watched with the background accompaniment of BBC Essential Comedy Sound Effects, Vol.1. PARP! You thought Brian McClairâ€™s first goal was bad? Have a look at this. HONK! Bryan Robsonâ€™s shot is blocked by Carlton Palmer but he manages to divert the rebound across goal. DONG! The usually immaculate Roland Nilsson stretches to divert the ball against his own post. CLANG! Carlton Palmer and Paul Warhurst fall over each other in the line. Carlton! BEEP! McClair almost misses from 0.0001 yards but eventually stabs it in off Palmer. TISH! United eventually lose the title because of two equally weird goals in Sheffield later in the season.    6) Franck Queudrue own goal, Bastia 1-3 Lens (Ligue 1, 7 April 2001) We werenâ€™t going to cover own goals â€“ house genius Scott Murray did those a few years ago â€“ but come on, the state of this. John Dreyer, eat your heart out.   ",1
"Opposition sympathiser and powerful cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranian regime ahead of the first anniversary of the disputed presidential election. The former president's website has again posted scathing pro-opposition remarks he made last year that criticised both the regime and supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself. The reappearance of Rafsanjani's comments comes just days before the June 12 anniversary of the presidential poll that returned Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power and sparked one of the worst internal crises in the Islamic republic's history. Iran was rocked by widespread and deadly street unrest immediately after Ahmadinejad's re-election -- a result his opponents said had been rigged. Thousands of people were jailed amid a crackdown aimed at stifling the opposition protests. The authorities said 36 people were killed in the weeks after the vote, but the opposition said that at least 72 died. Now Rafsanjani's website has again reproduced the text of his year-old letter to Khamenei in which he warned of social upheaval if the leader remained silent about a remark Ahmadinejad made before the election. In a television debate just days before the poll, Ahmadinejad accused Rafsanjani's family of corruption, prompting the cleric to send his letter of complaint to the supreme leader. 'Even if I keep quiet, part of the people, groups and parties will undoubtedly not bear this situation any more and set off social upheavals, examples of which can be seen in street rallies and universities,' Rafsanjani wrote. Addressing Khamenei in such a manner is unheard of in Iran where the supreme leader is the ultimate authority and has the final say on all strategic issues. The state news agency IRNA, meanwhile, said Khamenei is to lead Muslim prayers next Friday, in his first sermon at Friday weekly prayers since last June 19 when he defended Ahmadinejad's re-election. Reposting the letter is seen as an indication ahead of the anniversary that Rafsanjani's stance remains as critical as ever of the regime's handling of the post-election unrest last year. The Rafsanjani website also repeated remarks he made during a Friday prayer sermon last July 17 as the post-election unrest raged, when he openly said the election result had broken the trust of Iranians. 'What should we do?' Rafsanjani asked rhetorically in the sermon. 'Our key issue is to return the trust which the people had and now to some extent is broken. 'It is not necessary that in this situation people be jailed. Let them join their families. We should not allow enemies to rebuke and ridicule us because of detentions. We should tolerate each other,' he said. Rafsanjani is a sympathiser of the opposition, especially Mir Hossein Mousavi who was runner-up in the presidential election. Meanwhile Rafsanjani's daughter Faezeh, who heads an Islamic federation of female sports, issued a statement denouncing an 'attack against her office overnight Friday,' the opposition Rahesabz.net website reported. According to the statement, unidentified individuals 'broke the locks, destroyed equipment in the office... in a bid to create a climate of fear.' Faezeh and her brother Mehdi Hashemi have for months been the target of virulent verbal attacks by ultra-conservatives for their alleged role in the opposition movement. Opposition leaders Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohammad Khatami, another former president, have reiterated calls for a free election and demonstrations on June 12 to mark the anniversary. ",1
"In 1991, at just 23 years old, John Singleton made his explosively powerful debut with Boyz N the Hood, a film for which he deserved â€“ and largely got â€“ the kind of respect Scorsese earned for Mean Streets, although his Academy Award nomination was not converted into a win and a black director has yet to get the Oscar. In last yearâ€™s NWA movie Straight Outta Compton, Ice Cube is shown being furious with Eazy-E for calling it an â€œafter-school specialâ€. Itâ€™s way more than that. Boyz N the Hood is a passionate drama shot with fluency and style, a study of what amounts to life during wartime, with people grimly used to gunfire and helicopters thudding overhead.

Watched again, a quarter of a century on, what is so striking is not the confrontational aggression but the movieâ€™s humanity, idealism and lack of cynicism, bolstered by intelligent and powerful performances. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are Reva and Furious, the sundered parents of Tre Styles â€“ played by Cuba Gooding Jr, whose face looks heartbreakingly boyish and vulnerable â€“ a kid growing up in South Central Los Angeles. Fishburneâ€™s â€œgentrificationâ€ speech is as fierce as ever, along with his denunciation of SAT exams as culturally loaded, with the exception of maths. Ice Cube is Treâ€™s troubled friend Doughboy, with Morris Chestnut as Doughboyâ€™s brother Ricky; Tyra Ferrell is excellent in the role of their mother, who keeps plastic wrapping on her couch cushions to keep them from getting messed up, a personal touch which ultimately assumes tragic significance.





Ice Cubeâ€™s final speech about how fatalistic he is about his own life is subtly moving. It was a movie about male responsibility and sexual behaviour in an era oppressed by HIV/Aids, which perhaps makes it of its time. But it hasnâ€™t dated: this is a key text for the Black Lives Matter movement. Cubeâ€™s How to Survive in South Central, played over the closing credits, sends audiences reeling out of the cinema with just as much blistering power.

"Thinking quickly to devise a list of reasons why the area was not an ideal choice, local billing clerk Tim Connors, 33, managed to skillfully downplay the desirability of his neighborhood to a coworker who expressed an interest in potentially moving there, sources confirmed Wednesday. You know, it was pretty nice when I moved in a few years ago, but its actually kind of gone downhill a bit, said Connor, who mentioned the neighborhoods lack of easy access to a grocery store as well as the long commute to work each morning as serious things to consider before his colleague started looking at apartments in the area. Honestly, its okay, if you dont mind limited restaurant choices and all the noisy construction. Its fine for me right now, but if I could afford to I would probably move somewhere else. Connors added that if his coworker wanted to explore the neighborhood, he should definitely check out the main square, which he noted had a great little coffee shop and only a few muggings each month.

"Digital Age Privacy RightsStephen Lendman No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states: Everyone has the right to respect for his privacy and family life, his home and his correspondence. Articles 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondenceEveryone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Various other international accords affirm privacy rights. So does the US Constitution. The Fourth Amendment protects against lawless searches and seizure. The 1974 Privacy Act governs the collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information maintained by federal agencies. It prohibits disclosing it without written consent, stating: No (federal) agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains. The 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires administration officials to insure Americans personal records are adequately protected from misuse and security breaches. Washington consistently spurns rule of law principles. Mass NSA surveillance is one of many examples. In November, the General Assembly addressed privacy rights in the digital age. Over 50 member states co-sponsored a resolution to protect whats too precious to lose. On December 18, the 193-member body unanimously approved a resolution titled: The Right to privacy in the digital age. It reaffirmed a fundamental human right. No one should be denied the right to privacy. No one should be lawlessly spied on. No one living anywhere should be victimized. No one should be denied their fundamental human and civil rights. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the General Assemblys resolution one small step for privacy, one giant leap against surveillance. It requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report to the General Assembly on the protection of the right to privacy, including in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of digital communications and collection of personal data, including on a mass scale. EFF, likeminded legal scholars, and others prepared 13 International Principles for the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance. Its also called Necessary and Proportionate Principles. They include: Last August, Obama appointed a so-called independent commission/Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to assess and issue recommendations on NSA mass surveillance. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) head James Clapper supervised it. At the time, Obama said:(W)ere forming a high-level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies. We need new thinking for a new era. We now have to unravel terrorist plots by finding a needle in the haystack of global telecommunications. And meanwhile, technology has given governments including our own unprecedented capability to monitor communications. Theyll consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used, ask how surveillance impacts our foreign policy particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public. And they will provide an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of this year, so that we can move forward with a better understanding of how these programs impact our security, our privacy, and our foreign policy. On December 12, it released its report titled Liberty and Security in a Changing World. Its members were handpicked to support administration policy. They include: Last Summer, he made contradictory statements. On the one hand, he said Bush violated Fourth Amendment protections. On the other, he claimed Obama didnt, saying: Unlike the Obama program, which is limited to obtaining information about phone calls made and received from telephone companies, the Bush program authorized the government to wiretap private phone conversations. From a constitutional perspective, the difference is critical, and it is unfortunate that President Obama has not done a better job of explaining the distinction, and why his administrations program does not violate the constitutional right of privacy. Warrantless spying goes way beyond wiretapping. Mass surveillance watches everyone extrajudicially. Stone turned a blind eye to extreme lawlessness. Imagine what he teaches students. He publicly denounced Edward Snowden, saying: (F)rom a simple, straightforward, technical legal standpoint, theres absolutely no question that Snowden violated the law. And from that standpoint, if hes tried, he will be convicted, and he is in fact, from that perspective, a criminal. EFF addressed Obamas Review Board findings. It said risks caused by mass surveillance were recognized. Forty recommendations were made. Areas covered included transparency and protecting online security tools, as well as NSA, FISA Court authority, and civil liberties oversight groups organizational reforms. They stopped well short of whats needed. According to EFF: They left open the door for future mass surveillance and failed to address the constitutionality of the NSAs mass spying. EFF senior staff attorney Kurt Opsahl explained further, saying: The presidents panel agreed with the growing consensus that mass electronic surveillance has no place in American society. The review board floats a number of interesting reform proposals, and were especially happy to see them condemn the NSAs attacks on encryption and other security systems people rely upon. But were disappointed that the recommendations suggest a path to continue untargeted spying. Mass surveillance is still heinous, even if private company servers are holding the data instead of government data centers. EFFs Trevor Timm added: Were concerned that the panel appears to allow the NSA to continue the mass collection of emails, chats and other electronic communications of Americans under the pretext that the NSA is targeting foreigners overseas. While were happy that the panel acknowledged that foreigners abroad need some additional privacy protections, mass surveillance isnt acceptable for Americans or foreigners. Obamas handpicked insider group left unaddressed whats most important. Mass surveillance is unconstitutional. It violates fundamental international law provisions. It has no place in any society. Its use reflects police state lawlessness. Its practice assures fundamental rights no longer exist. America is a hairs breadth away from full-blown tyranny. Obama bears full responsibility. He exceeded the worst of George Bush. He governs by diktat authority. His secret kill list decides who lives or dies. Hes ravaging one country after another. Hes waging war on fundamental human and civil rights at home. Theyre disappearing in plain sight. No one any longer is safe. Anyone can be arrested for any reason or none at all. They can be indefinitely detained uncharged. They can be held in a military dungeon. They can be left there out of sight and mind. They can get denied the right to counsel and other basic rights. They can be killed by presidential edict. Civil protections no longer apply. Habeas and due process rights are gone. Judicial fairness is null and void. Privacy no longer exists. Mass spying facilitates out-of-control lawlessness. Big Brother watches everyone. Obamas so-called independent Review Board said its OK. Mass surveillance and freedom cant co-exist. Continuing it assures its extinction. Edward Snowden said: I do not want to live in a world where everything I do or say is recorded. Millions of Americans feel the same way. So do countless others worldwide. Freedom is too precious to lose. Its vanishing today in plain sight.

"A century after an explosion in a Leeds munitions factory killed scores of female workers, whose deaths were kept secret for years after the first world war, the site is to be given official protection by the government as a historic monument. During the night shift on 5 December 1916, room 42 of the Barnbow National Filling Factory in Leeds blew up: 35 women were killed immediately, and many more injured. The factory, which produced many of the shells used at the Somme, was the largest of its kind in Britain, employing 16,000 women working round the clock at the height of production.   Related: Why we should remember the first world warâ€™s female munitions workers | Bob Holman   The explosion was heard for miles and although everyone working in the factory knew what had happened â€“ particularly as women from other sections rushed to help rescue the injured workers â€“ all news of the incident was officially censored, and no official explanation was given until six years after the war. Death notices in local papers for the women, nicknamed the Barnbow Lasses, just said they had died â€œin an accidentâ€. It was the first major loss of women civilian workers in the war, and the worst fatal accident in the cityâ€™s history. Two smaller explosions followed, one in March 1917 which killed another two women, and one in March 1918 in which three men died. In 1916 production only stopped for a few hours. Although the work was hard and dangerous, it was well paid, with the women taking home up to Â£12 a week, far more than an average industrial wage. They also suffered from the cordite used in the process which turned their skin yellow, earning munitions workers the nickname canaries.    The Barnbow Lasses work on weapons at the factory. Photograph: Historic England   Most of the buildings were demolished in the 1920s, but the outlines of the site remain well preserved on the outskirts of the city. Mondayâ€™s scheduled monument designation has been given to mark the importance of the site, and Historic England and the local authority are in discussions about how to protect it from a proposed new major road and housing.  Local campaigners who have tried to raise awareness of the disaster, including building a small monument near the site, are delighted that it will now have official protection. Jacki and Bob Lawrence, members of the East Leeds History and Archaeology Society, said the outcome of the war might have been quite different without the volume of shells produced by the factory. â€œAs a society we have been promoting the story of the Barnbow Lasses for almost 20 years, and always felt it was important that the contribution, service and sacrifice made by these girls during world war one should be made more widely known.â€",1

"A study by a parcel delivery service â€“ perhaps based on the number of pairs of jeans that get sent back â€“ found that most people think other people shouldnâ€™t wear jeans after theyâ€™re 53. Why 53? Come to that, why jeans?  The answer to the second question may explain everything. Jeans are universal, intergenerational and global. They can be invisible or absolutely in your face. Nine tenths of the worldâ€™s population â€“ not a scientific number â€“ must have owned a pair at some time. So pretty well everyone is going to have a view on when to stop wearing them. Why 53? Just to be annoying.    Anne Perkins wearing jeans. Photograph: Anne Perkins   Like all the most irritating â€œstudiesâ€, this stinks. It is random fashion police activity that is nothing to do with fashion and all about making one group of people feel bad about themselves with a side of schadenfreude for everyone else. Maybe there are now thousands of people squeezing themselves into their skinny jeans thinking, at least Iâ€™m not 53, while those of us who are a) over 53 and b) rely on jeans for daily wear, feel if not foolish then at least a bit self-doubting. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I am not saying that age is irrelevant, just that judging what is age appropriate is totally subjective. Itâ€™s a factor along with all the other factors that interfere with leaving the house, like does my bum look big/my legs fat/insert personal phobia here. The only rule is that there are no rules, just like all the other so called rules about what to wear. From long and sometimes costly experience I have learned that if I ask myself if it looks a bit young, the answer is that it does. Not that I always listen to my inner adviser, which is why there are dresses in my wardrobe that I never wear because they make me feel a bit like Grayson Perry. Obviously, a subliminal yearning for girly frocks is some kind of eruption of suppressed regret for the curvy figure I never had.    Kristin Scott Thomas in denim. Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock   Maybe jeans, in the eyes of the judgmental, are a bit less forgiving than most other clothes. If you look like Kate Moss, then in a way that absolutely no other single item of clothing can, they convey the Iâ€™m-not-trying-but-God-I-just-canâ€™t-help-looking-amazing school of style. Maybe, if I peer into my underdeveloped fashionista soul, I should acknowledge that jeans, more than any other personal choice, do carry a subliminal â€œdonâ€™t write me offâ€ message, a teeny scintilla of street cred that clings like a ghost of what one once imagined one was. But the thing about jeans is that, just like bodies, they come in an infinite variety of shapes and styles. For each pair that makes some bold statement about the wearer there are a thousand others that just happen to be the nearest clean thing in the wardrobe. And the more ancient and decrepit I get, the more pleasure I shall have from the one thing that looks mildly in touch with fashion, while also being machine washable and never in need of the iron. I wonder if they make them baggy enough for wearers of continence pads?",1
"The city of Orlando is to buy Pulse nightclub and turn it into a memorial to the 49 people who were murdered there on 12 June, in the deadliest mass shooting in US history.   Related: Police release Omar Mateen's 911 calls inside Pulse during Orlando shooting   The Orlando Sentinel reports that the city has reached a deal to pay $2.25m (Â£1.8m) for the club, though it does not plan to transform it immediately because it is being visited by so many mourners from both the local area and further afield.  â€œThere are lots of people that are making a visit to the site part of their trip, part of their experience of Orlando, so I think 12-18 months of leaving it as-is would be appropriate,â€ the cityâ€™s mayor, Buddy Dyer, told the Sentinel. Pulse was a mainstay of the cityâ€™s gay scene before Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in the early hours of Sunday 12 June 2016. Dyer said the city wanted to â€œcreate something to honour the memory of the victims that are deceased [and] those that were injured, and a testament to the resilience of our communityâ€. He said it was possible parts of the club might be left intact in the memorial, but that city residents would be asked what form it should take.   Related: Glastonbury: drag queens lead salute to Orlandoâ€™s victims   Dyer added that it would now be possible to protect the property and deal with the wider safety issues that have arisen since the shootings. The Sentinel reports that those making pilgrimages to the site have caused disruption to local businesses and residents, with parking and pedestrian crowding becoming particular issues. Rolling Stone noted that the owners of Pulse had announced on Instagram in August that they planned to convert the venue into a memorial, only to almost immediately recant that statement. â€œYou heard right! We will be reopening Pulse as a memorial for the 49 lives who were taken from us on 12 June,â€ they said. Followed swiftly by: â€œOOPS! Looks like we got the mediaâ€™s pulse racing with an inadvertent Instagram posting that incorrectly stated the Pulse nightclub was reopening as a memorial.â€ ",1
"For an agency that has conducted most of its business behind closed doors for decades, the meeting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey held on Monday morning was indisputably extraordinary.A committee of the authorityâ€™s board of directors had invited a group of outsiders to suggest ways to fix the beleaguered agency and invited the public to watch. For two hours, the panel of outsiders took turns reproaching the directors and the governors they answer to for having allowed the authority to devolve into a patronage mill and a piggy bank for pet projects.The solution, most of them agreed, was to curtail the influence of the governors of New York and New Jersey and operate the authority with less secrecy, tantamount to heresy for an agency board that has traditionally done little more in public than announce its decisions.The committee hearing the suggestions exists only because the Port Authority was thoroughly embarrassed by the role some of its officials played in a scheme to disrupt traffic to the George Washington Bridge last year. The disruption tarnished the reputation of New Jerseyâ€™s governor, Chris Christie, and spurred several investigations, including one by the office of the Manhattan district attorney.As a result, Scott H. Rechler, the vice chairman of the board, formed the committee to find ways to reform the agency. One of his first steps was to declare that the committee would conduct its business in the open, a practice the panelists agreed should be adopted by the full board.â€œThere shouldnâ€™t be anything to hide,â€ said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. â€œThere should be no secret votes.â€Mr. Yaro was one of five on the panel. The others were Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University; Martin E. Robins, the founding director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University; Jameson W. Doig, a professor at Princeton University; and Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission.Given the agencyâ€™s entrenched culture and practices, it was unclear how much sway the panelistsâ€™ views might have.They criticized the Port Authorityâ€™s tit-for-tat custom, which allows the governors of New York and New Jersey to divide up the spoils of the agency. It takes in about $4.4 billion a year, mostly from bridge and tunnel tolls and airport fees.That approach is being scrutinized by federal investigators in the wake of the sudden closing in September of two of three local lanes from Fort Lee, N.J., to the tollbooths of the George Washington Bridge. Revelations that the closings were the handiwork of Mr. Christieâ€™s allies at the Port Authority raised questions about how the Christie administration had arranged to spend Port Authority money on certain projects in New Jersey.Ms. Kellerman reminded the directors that the compact that created the Port Authority in 1921 said the goal was to create â€œcordial collaborationâ€ between the two states, â€œnot conscious parallelism.â€ She said the Port Authority should publish forecasts of its annual budgets so that people could see what shape the agencyâ€™s finances were in. When Mr. Rechler responded that the agency had recently developed a â€œfairly comprehensive forecasting model,â€ Ms. Kellerman countered, â€œWe all look forward to sharing those documents.â€There was near-consensus that one way to make the authority less susceptible to the whims of dueling governors would be to have the board choose the executive director of the agency and have the executive director choose the deputy executive director. Much of the dysfunction at the Port Authority, they said, stemmed from the divided loyalties of the appointees.For about 20 years, the custom has been for the governor of New York to appoint the executive director and the governor of New Jersey to appoint the deputy. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York appointed Patrick J. Foye, the current executive director.Mr. Christie had to choose a new deputy after his first appointee to the job, Bill Baroni, resigned after his role in the bridge-traffic debacle was exposed. Mr. Christie chose Deborah L. Gramiccioni, who had been a lawyer in his office, to succeed Mr. Baroni.The board has been without a chairman since David Samson, a lawyer and close friend of Mr. Christieâ€™s, resigned last month amid investigations into his conduct. Another representative of New Jersey on the board, Anthony J. Sartor, resigned last week.Mr. Rechler said he agreed that the board should choose the executives to run the agency and that those executives should answer to the board and not to the governors. But he said that even if those changes were made to the organizational structure, the agency probably would not immediately search for successors to Mr. Foye and Ms. Gramiccioni, both of whom attended the meeting on Monday.Mr. Rechler said it was problematic that â€œDeb Gramiccioni reports to Trentonâ€ and that it would be better if â€œPat Foye would report to the board solely.â€",1

"War Matrix: New System Enables Drones and Robots to Work TogetherNicholas West In September 2011, selfnews Post reported on a project called MUSIC a fusion of aerial and ground robotics with other manned systems that could extend across the different branches of the military Army, Air Force, Marines, and Navy. Most troubling is that MUSIC was intended to be directed either by a single operator, or the final goal of being fully autonomous. It is part and parcel of the concept that originally embodied Future Combat Systems. For a perfect look as what full-spectrum dominance really means, here are their words: This program was canceled, due in part to energy challenges for keeping the aerial components of the system aloft for long periods of time, but has since morphed into other programs for theoretical continuance. Newer research aims to explore ideas such as using laser energy and solar drones. Another new concept focuses on the aspects of drone-to-robot communications between their different spheres. A team at Yonsei University, Korea summarizes the core challenges: Researchers cite advances in the structure of imaging technology that could provide a non-GPS, non-sensor solution for integrating drones and robots into one overall sphere of communication. Readers interested in full details can access the full press release link below. Naturally, as with nearly all of these types of academic press releases, they cite potential benefits while downplaying or ignoring greater negative impacts. In this case, researchers cite applications in RoboFarming for better crop data collection and analysis. Then, a small note about the obvious military applications. The team concludes with projections for a more cooperative future including intelligent robots, IoT (Internet of Things Ed.) devices, and media art applications. Given what we know about the concerns voiced over the potential for killer robots and the arrival of a Superintelligence, the future could be anything but cooperative, at least for humans its likely to be more about dominance. The bottom line is that the pieces continue to be built and assembled into place that could usher in the arrival of a full Skynet-type system. Any development that enables that reality must be condemned and met with full-spectrum resistance. Source: The Institution of Engineering and Technology Recently by Nicholas West: ",0
"For more than three decades, Darius McCollumâ€™s transit exploits have appeared in police reports and newspapers. Then came the news this month that his story might be turned into a movie starring Julia Roberts.But on Monday, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that they would move to recover any profits he would earn from the film because the agency had been a victim of his crimes.It was the latest chapter in the tale of Mr. McCollum, New York Cityâ€™s famed train and bus thief. Mr. McCollum, who has Aspergerâ€™s syndrome, is currently in jail at Rikers Island on charges that he stole a Greyhound bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal last fall.A spokesman for the authority, Kevin Ortiz, said it would try to recoup any â€œill-gotten gains he receives from participation in this purported film project.â€ The agency called upon the producers to notify New York Stateâ€™s Office of Victim Services about the details of their financial arrangement with Mr. McCollum, who will turn 51 next Monday.Variety reported last week that Ms. Roberts was set to star as Mr. McCollumâ€™s lawyer, Sally Butler, in â€œTrain Man,â€ a film based on his life. A producer described the film to Entertainment Weekly as â€œâ€˜Erin Brockovichâ€™ meets â€˜Catch Me if You Can,â€™â€ referring to the film that won Ms. Roberts an Oscar and another in which Leonardo DiCaprio played a con artist.The authority said it would seek to obtain any money that Mr. McCollum makes from the film project under a New York State law intended to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes. The statute, known as the Son of Sam law, is based on legislation created to prevent David Berkowitz, the serial killer, from profiting by selling his story.A transportation enthusiast, Mr. McCollum first gained notoriety in 1981 when he took over the controls of a train in Manhattan at age 15. Since then, he has been arrested more than two dozen times and once dressed as a transit employee to get inside a subway control room.On Monday, Ms. Butler said that it was outrageous that the authority was going after â€œwhat little money Darius may or may not get.â€ A film deal has not been made final, she said, and it is unclear how much Mr. McCollum may receive.â€œItâ€™s not going to be such a significant amount that the M.T.A. would want to waste money on the team of lawyers they would need to pursue this,â€ Ms. Butler said. â€œThey will take it over my dead body.â€Ms. Butler defended her client, saying he was a kind person who had not injured anyone. He needs mental health treatment, not further punishment, and the authorities should seek his advice about how to improve security, she said.â€œIf itâ€™s true that he can walk in and take a bus, maybe you need some help,â€ said Ms. Butler, who declined to comment on her potential portrayal by Ms. Roberts.The Gotham Group, the filmâ€™s producer, declined to discuss the film or to comment on the authorityâ€™s request to notify the victim services office.In November, Mr. McCollum was arrested on charges that he stole a bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan after officials tracked it to the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. He is being held on a $50,000 bail or $100,000 bond.At an authority board meeting on Monday, Charles G. Moerdler, a member of the board, said that he was concerned that Mr. McCollum would not stop taking trains and buses on joy rides.â€œI think you need to establish a precedent,â€ Mr. Moerdler said. â€œYou do this sort of stuff, and you pay the penalty.â€Veronique Hakim, the head of the cityâ€™s subway and bus system, told board members that the agency would take on the issue and signaled her disapproval of the film.â€œApparently,â€ Ms. Hakim said, â€œIâ€™m not in touch with what makes for good popular entertainment.â€Son of Sam laws have been cited frequently over the years to try to keep offenders from gaining from their crimes. Last year, prosecutors said that David Sweat, an inmate who escaped from a state prison, would not be able to profit by selling his story of the manhunt that followed.Leon Friedman, a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University who worked on a case involving Son of Sam laws in the 1990s, said it appeared the authority had a good case to seek money from the film.Mr. McCollum â€œdid commit a crime, and they suffered as a result of it,â€ Mr. Friedman said, referring to the authority.â€œAnd now he has additional money as a result of this deal,â€ he continued.Mr. McCollumâ€™s mother, Elizabeth, said on Monday in a phone interview from her home in North Carolina that she hoped the film would show the true story of struggles her son had faced over the years. He deserved to keep the money, she said, adding, â€œThis is the story of his life.â€",1

"SYDNEY, Australia â€” In the United States, painting yourself black to impersonate a person of color is considered a particularly grotesque form of racism. In Australia, it keeps happening. Indeed, 2016 has been a notable year for Australian blackface incidents.In January, a fan at the Australian Open painted her face shoe-polish black in what she intended as a show of support for Serena Williams. A month later, a player for a womenâ€™s basketball team, Alice Kunek, posted a photo of herself dressed as Kanye West, complete with blackface makeup. In August, a proud Perth mother posted a picture of her 9-year-old son covered in brown makeup as a tribute to his Fijian-Australian hero, Nic Naitanui, the Australian rules football player.Many Australians who regard racism as a profound evil will defend blackface as harmless fun, or at least â€œnot racist.â€ Their argument is that if there is no intention to be racist, it canâ€™t be racist, regardless of how unflattering people of color find it to have their skins adopted as costumes.These episodes provoke reactions ranging from bemusement to horror when Americans hear about them. â€œIn Australia, Blackface Is Still Only Slightly Offensive,â€ was a headline on the website Gawker in 2009. Writing about the Serena Williams incident, Adrian Hasenmayer of Fox Sports said blackface was considered â€œbeyond taboo in modern times,â€ something that seems self-evident to Americans but not to Australians.Why isnâ€™t blackface taboo for Australians?The problem isnâ€™t that Australians fail to understand the American historical context of blackface. The problem is we think only Americans have reason to be upset by it.Australia and the United States share a history of white domination. Both were founded as settler colonies whose existence depended on driving indigenous peoples from their lands. Both denied political and economic rights to nonwhite people, whose labor was exploited. And both countries adopted restrictive immigration laws to keep their national complexions white.The similarities did not go unnoticed. In 1894, Theodore Roosevelt rejoiced that â€œdemocracyâ€ in Australia and America had â€œkept for the white race the best portions of the New Worldsâ€™ surface.â€In Australia the price of keeping land for the white race was brutal frontier wars and massacres of the indigenous population that began soon after the British colonized the continent in 1788. The last recorded massacre occurred in 1928. In the 20th century, governments could remove children from Aboriginal families for almost any reason. Aboriginal people were denied equal wages and government benefits, and didnâ€™t get full voting rights until the 1960s.Today, indigenous communities in Australia suffer from many of the same difficulties as Native Americans in the United States: high levels of poverty, health problems, violence, imprisonment and suicide.Now that racism is seen as a unique moral sin, white Australians and Americans share guilt, rather than pride, at the practices of the past. But Americans have to confront at least some of their past every day. The legacy of slavery is a large, politically robust African-American population whose struggle for equality has become central to United States politics and the narrative of American history.White Australians do not have to face up to our past in the same way.Indigenous Australians make up some 3 percent of Australiaâ€™s population and have not known real political power since white settlement violently robbed them of their land.Nor is their story very well known. An Australian journalist of Aboriginal ancestry, Stan Grant, recently noted that Australians were more likely to know about Sitting Bull and Custer and Little Big Horn than Aboriginal resistance leaders like Pemulwuy or massacres in places like Coniston.Commemorating war is central to our national identity, but the frontier wars that made modern Australia are left out of official remembrances. Nor do we give much thought to the legacy of the White Australia policy, which barred nonwhite immigrants until the Vietnam War. Today people of Asian descent make up 12 percent of the population, but you wouldnâ€™t guess this from looking at legislative bodies or TV shows.White domination seems so natural here that whites donâ€™t recognize it, though it is shockingly obvious to outsiders.Indeed, white Australians seem to have a much better understanding of how racism shaped American society. Thanks to its cultural reach and political power, as well as its violent history, the United States has given us many of our ideas about what racism is: slavery, segregation, the Ku Klux Klan and police brutality. It also gives Australians a convenient alibi when it comes to blackface: Blackface is a problem only because of Americaâ€™s racist past, not ours.Indigenous and other nonwhite Australians are tired of telling the country what is wrong with blackface.Nakkiah Lui, an indigenous writer and actor, said in an interview this year that blackface was â€œnot this act of respect â€” usually itâ€™s something there to be funny and to be made fun of.â€ It â€œmakes you feel like youâ€™re put back in your place.â€Maxine Beneba Clarke, an Australian writer of African-Caribbean descent, notes that blackface has long been used to mock Aboriginal people, from theater in the 1830s to TV in the 2000s. The indigenous rapper Briggs describes the exhausting routine of having to explain, in 2016, that blackface is racist. â€œPeople look at me like itâ€™s my problem,â€ he said to an ABC radio program, as if â€œpointing out racism is worse than the act itself.â€White Australians pay little attention when indigenous Australians say that what whites see as entertainment, they see as degradation. Australians seem to believe that such complaints create racial conflict where there is none. Aboriginal people do not have the political power to make us reconsider our casual racism. But we do take notice when Americans criticize us for it.In Melbourne in 2009, Harry Connick Jr. condemned a blackface tribute to the Jackson Five on a talent show that he had been invited to judge in front of an estimated TV audience of 2.5 million (more than 10 percent of Australiaâ€™s population). â€œI just want to say on behalf of my country,â€ said Mr. Connick, â€œweâ€™ve spent so much time trying to not make black people look like buffoons, that when we see something like that, we take it really to heart.â€Days of debate followed, with disbelief from some quarters that an American would have the temerity to criticize Australians for racism. In an article, the psychologist Clemence Due cataloged the many online responses. â€œThe U.S. is uncomfortably aware of its slavery history, leading to a degree of P.C. that is unwarranted in Australia,â€ declared one. Another said: â€œOh, thatâ€™s rich. Being called racist by the Americans. We didnâ€™t import black slaves and beat them to work for us. We didnâ€™t have â€˜whites onlyâ€™ waiting rooms, buses, schools and so on.â€The â€œreal sin,â€ according to the widely read commentator Andrew Bolt, was failing to realize that an American like Mr. Connick would be offended by the performance. In the United States, he wrote, blackface has a â€œvery, very different cultural resonanceâ€ and he reflected that Americans wouldnâ€™t understand that â€œblackface isnâ€™t for us an iconic symbol of racism.â€ Similarly, in response to Alice Kunekâ€™s Kanye West homage this year, a broadcaster described the offense given by blackface as â€œan American thing,â€ the result of â€œa long history in America, not here.â€These commentators reflect a broader Australian sentiment that the â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ involved in policing language and behavior is an American creation, a response to racial tension that isnâ€™t necessary in our easygoing homeland.We Australians donâ€™t consider ourselves a racist country. We take pride in our cultural diversity. But our nearly all-white governments and boardrooms reflect a historical reality of white domination that was more complete than what was achieved in the United States. And this is why we still donâ€™t fully understand the problem with blackface. White Australians are rarely forced to think about things from a nonwhite point of view.The day after Barack Obama was elected president of the United States, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that his presidency â€œmarks a stunning cultural shift, with Senator Obama, the son of Kenyan father and white mother from Kansas, the first African-American president of a nation still riven by racial divides.â€ Such sentiments were echoed all over the world in other majority-white countries.We marveled at how such a racially troubled country could elect a black man to its highest office, giving little thought to how remote such a possibility was in our own countries.The legacy of white supremacy in Australia isnâ€™t the fiery cross and the white hood. Itâ€™s the luxury of white thoughtlessness.",1
"I am on my way to meet Wendi Murdoch â€“ as, Iâ€™m surprised to learn, she still likes to be known â€“ and Iâ€™m scared to death. Câ€™mon, you remember Wendi Murdoch. Rupertâ€™s ex-wife. The incredibly glamorous one with long hair â€“ no, not Jerry Hall, thatâ€™s the current one. The one before â€“ the fiercer one. The one who grew up in a small flat in China and ended up living in the most expensive apartment in Manhattan â€“ $44m (Â£35.8m), donâ€™t you know â€“ after meeting Rupert at Star TV, which he owns, in Hong Kong. According to multiple reports at the time, his children from his previous marriage loathed her, and not just because of their fatherâ€™s bafflingly bad dye job that happened on her watch, although I always thought that was cause enough. Her most glorious moment on the international stage was when she walloped Johnnie Marbles, aka Jonathan May-Bowles, a protestor who tried to pie Rupert during his 2011 parliamentary appearance (â€œMr Murdoch, your wife has a very good left hook,â€ Tom Watson said, rightly, at the time).  Sadly, this image of marital bliss soon ended and the two were divorced in 2013, possibly or possibly not due to causes related to a note she apparently wrote about Rupertâ€™s close friend, Tony Blair: â€œOh, shit, oh, shit. Whatever why Iâ€™m so missing Tony. Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt â€¦ And he is slim tall and good skin,â€ the note read. Blair and Wendi have both denied that anything improper happened between them. More recently, she has had to deny further rumours that she is in a relationship with â€“ but of course â€“ Vladimir Putin, although that the rumour sounded so credible says a lot about Wendi. So, like I said, Iâ€™m terrified. But, if Iâ€™m honest, an even bigger part of me would like her to be my life coach.    Deng Murdoch with ex-husband Rupert Murdoch in 2011. Photograph: Vincent Kessler/REUTERS     Related: Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang review   I decide the best way to make her adopt me is to try to dress like her. To this end, Iâ€™ve studied her Instagram, which features cosy pictures of her with Naomi Campbell, Anna Wintour and, er, Henry Kissinger. Her style is best described as â€œinternational lady billionaireâ€: some independent labels (Christopher Kane, Giambattista Valli) mixed with the big stalwarts (Dior, Chanel). The closest I can get to this in my closet is a very old Diane von Furstenberg dress and some scuffed Miu Miu shoes. This is, without a doubt, the most dressed up Iâ€™ve ever been for work and, as I hustle to a central London hotel to meet her on a Friday morning, I feel slightly like Iâ€™m going on the scariest date of my life. The reason Iâ€™m meeting her is that she has produced a film, and guess what? Itâ€™s really good. Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang is a documentary directed by Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void, The Last King of Scotland) about the extraordinary Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang, who â€“ as well as being a skilled painter, sculptor and taxidermist â€“ works in gunpowder and explosives (you probably know him best as the man behind the mind-blasting fireworks display at the Beijing Olympics opening and closing ceremonies).  The film follows him as he tries to realise his 20-year dream of creating what he calls a â€œsky ladderâ€: a fireworks project that resembles a 500-metre ladder reaching up into the heavens. Alongside this, Macdonald traces a line between Caiâ€™s family and childhood during the cultural revolution and the art he makes today. The art really is incredible, but itâ€™s Cai himself who really stands out â€“ a gentle, charming man with a bright smile, a world away from the usual image of the tortured artist.    With Naomi Campbell in 2011. Photograph: Alexandra Wyman/GETTY IMAGES   Iâ€™m meeting Cai (pronounced Tsye) and Murdoch in the hotel, which creates a rather tricky interview dynamic. On the one hand, thereâ€™s the extremely impressive Cai, who proves to be as warm in person as he is in the film. On the other hand, thereâ€™s Murdoch, as fascinatingly frightening as Iâ€™d hoped and a thoroughly distracting presence. I ask Cai who persuaded him to allow a documentary-maker to trail him around for months and poke around in his life. â€œIt was Wendi,â€ he replies at once, unsurprisingly. I imagine she is good at persuading people, I say. â€œI had never done a documentary before, so I met Fisher Stevens, who is an amazing documentary filmmaker, and he and I talked together about [directors] Bennett Miller and Kevin Macdonald, and we got them both,â€ she says with a bark of laughter. Her accent is like the distilled essence of a first-class lounge in an airport, an unplaceable mix of various but undeniably well-heeled intonations. â€œBeforeâ€, for example, becomes â€œbefarrrrrrâ€, sort of how Katharine Hepburn might have said it, but louder and more rat-a-tat-tat. Cai smiles at how Murdoch was able to persuade three esteemed directors to work on her film, with Stevens and Miller acting as producers: â€œWendiâ€™s really amazing. Sheâ€™s able to bring all these little boys together.â€ And how does she do that, I ask.    A still from Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang   Cai just laughs, but Murdoch makes a sly smile at me and arching her eyebrows while batting her lashes. â€œI love working with creative people,â€ she says, with a flick of her long hair. Cai is dressed just as I would expect of an artist, by which I mean he is dressed a little like Vincent van Gogh, with a loose tweedy jacket, a simple jumper and loose trousers. Murdoch, by contrast, is in her usual glamazon style and she happily talks me through her outfit: â€œI love having fun with fashion,â€ she says, waggling her leather-and-tweed flat boots (â€œChanelâ€) while the rest of her is in a long-sleeved black top with ruffles (â€œPeter Pilottoâ€) and a leather skirt (unspecified). Cai and Murdoch make a somewhat unlikely double act, although they have been friends for 15 years, ever since they met at the Royal Academy in London and realised they were neighbours in downtown Soho, New York.    Deng Murdochâ€™s second film, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. Photograph: Allstar/FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES   â€œOur children play together and speak Chinese together,â€ says Murdoch (her daughters with Rupert are 15 and 13; Caiâ€™s are 26 and 13). â€œAnd I just knew Caiâ€™s story would make such a great story: a child from a small town becomes a huge star internationally. Then you have to ask yourself: how do I challenge myself now? I need new things. Itâ€™s a universal story,â€ she says. Well, not quite universal. But perhaps she related to it on some level? â€œYeah. But we all relate to it.â€ Sky Ladder is Murdochâ€™s second film; Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, a historical drama set in 19th-century and modern China, was released by 20th Century Fox â€“ of which Rupert was CEO at the time) and was not a critical success. She is already working on her third film, although she wonâ€™t talk about it yet. Has she ever asked Harvey Weinstein for tips about how to produce? (I find itâ€™s generally a safe assumption that all super-rich people know each other.) â€œOh, I love Harveyâ€™s movies!â€ she says. (See?) â€œBut I didnâ€™t want to bother him â€“ heâ€™s so busy.â€ And who needs Weinsteinâ€™s advice anyway? I get the strong impression that Murdochâ€™s chief gifts are bringing people together (â€œWhenever a famous person is dating another famous person, chances are that Wendi Murdoch brought them together,â€ according to Vogue), and then bending them to her will, both of which seem like good qualities for a producer. I had been firmly instructed by the PRs to stick to questions about the movie, but I canâ€™t help but notice that her name in the credits is Wendi Murdoch, not Wendi Deng. Why is that?    A still from Sky Ladder: Cai Guo-Qiangâ€™s Elegy, on the riverfront of the Power Station of Art, China. Photograph: Lin Yi/Netflix/Courtesy of Cai Studio   â€œBecause my children are Murdoch,â€ she replies. Does she think the Murdoch name helps her? â€œNo, I donâ€™t think so,â€ she says, sounding a little astonished at the thought. So presumably she and her ex are on good terms if she has kept his name? â€œMany people ask that,â€ she says, again sounding surprised. â€œWe are very friendly. We parent together and we go to school events together. We have the same rules for the kids, like not to spend hours on social media. Heâ€™s an excellent father and we are on the same page.â€ So is she happy that he has found love with Jerry Hall? â€œMmm, next time you interview me we can discuss that,â€ she says, and I suspect Iâ€™m just about escaping Johnny Marblesâ€™ fate. Still, in for a penny and all that, so I carry on. Is she dating? This question seems to please her more: â€œI am, but no one serious. No one in particular.â€    With Ivanka Trump in 2015. Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images   One particular person she is definitely not dating is Putin. â€œIâ€™ve never met Putin,â€ she said to US Vogue this summer. And yet, our conversation does return to Russia frequently. Sky Ladder recently had a successful screening there. â€œRussia and China, these old communist cities, they connect,â€ smiles Murdoch. â€œA shared history of cultural revolution,â€ agrees Cai. In fact, she and Cai first discussed plans for the documentary on a flight to Sochi, on their way to the winter Olympics. But nobody goes to watch the winter Olympics. What were they up to? â€œWe go to almost all the Olympics!â€ says Murdoch. â€œI like to see all the nervous people. Itâ€™s like the excitement Iâ€™d feel for the Chinese Spring festival,â€ says Cai, sweetly. â€œAnd the winning,â€ says Murdoch, less sweetly. As well as producing, Murdoch backs an art website with Dasha Zhukova, the wife of Roman Abramovich, and the two are close friends. Itâ€™s that Chinese and Russian connection again, I say. She looks at me suspiciously and sits forward. I mean you and Dasha, I say nervously. â€œAh right,â€ she says, sitting back again. Another close friend is Ivanka Trump, who Murdoch set up with her now husband, Jared Kushner, and the threesome were photographed holidaying together in Croatia this August. I ask Cai and Murdoch how they find it living in America during this especially crazy election. â€œWhat theyâ€™re experiencing is similar to whatâ€™s happening around the world, like the referendum in Britain,â€ says Cai. â€œI agree,â€ says Murdoch firmly. That must be rather awkward, given that sheâ€™s such close friends with Donald Trumpâ€™s daughter.    The team behind Sky Ladder: Murdoch with Fisher Stevens, Cai Guo-Qiang and Kevin Macdonald Photograph: Maarten de Boer/Getty Images   â€œWell, sheâ€™s not running for office. Sheâ€™s very impressive. She has three children and she is teaching them Chinese. Itâ€™s very nice. Weâ€™ve been friendly for many years. I try to separate [the election] from that. She collects art, you know.â€ Iâ€™ll say this for Murdoch: sheâ€™s a real hoot. Terrifying, obviously, but also hilarious, sometimes deliberately so. When I ask her to describe her typical day, she reels off: â€œI wake up early, then I work out,â€ she begins, and she mimics lifting dumbbells, which is quite a sight to see in her Chanel boots. She clearly cares about educating the west about China; as well as making China-based movies, she co-hosted the massive exhibition, China: Through the Looking Glass, at New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Museum last year, â€œand a lot of people told me they loved the show and it opened their eyes. So thatâ€™s good,â€ she says. But sheâ€™s a lot more relaxed when sheâ€™s talking about fashion, dating and her friends. I can see why Rupertâ€™s kids were wary of her (a shy and retiring stepmother she was never going to be), but I always thought she looked a lot more entertaining than any of them. She would be a lot of fun to have a two-martini lunch with at some fancy place on Manhattanâ€™s Upper East Side. And sheâ€™d be petrifying to antagonise. The time is up and, as I stand, Cai gives me a beautiful postcard of the Sky Ladder. Murdoch, meanwhile, gives my outfit a very blatant once-over. The room goes silent. I hold my breath. â€œOh, God, I love your shoes!â€ she shrieks. â€œThe heel â€“ so perfect!â€ Nailed it. â€¢ Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang is on Netflix and in UK cinemas from 14 October",1

"As Iraq Burns, US Plans $500 Million to Terrorists in SyriaTony Cartalucci The reportage is a stunning entanglement of contradictions, claiming that the additional funding for terrorists fighting in Syria will somehow address spillover that is in fact a direct result of US, NATO, and their Persian Gulf collaborators creation, expansion, and perpetuation of the war in Syria in the first place. The NYT also stated: Despite the NYTs attempt to portray the US as having consistently resisted providing military aid to terrorists operating along and within Syrias borders, the US, UK, NATO, and the Persian Gulf monarchies have provided terrorists hundreds of millions in aid, including weapons, equipment, and even vehicles. NATO-member Turkey has also provided air and artillery cover for terrorists during cross border operations including most recently in the northwest village of Kessab. The answer is simple. There never were any moderates to begin with. An Independent article titled, I am not fighting against al-Qaida its not our problem, says Wests last hope in Syria, claims: And even with the Independent quoting the would-be recipients of yet hundreds of millions more in Western aid, admitting they work in tandem with Al Qaeda which is now cutting a swatch of horror and mayhem across neighboring Iraq, the truth is from the very beginning, years in fact before the so-called Arab Spring even began, the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia conspired to overthrow Iran and its arch of influence, including the government of Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and surely the Iran-leaning government in Baghdad, by organizing, funding, and arming sectarian militants including Al Qaeda itself. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hershs 2007 New Yorker article, The Redirection prophetically stated (emphasis added): Throughout the rest of Hershs nine-page report, which came out 4 years before the so-called Arab Spring unfolded, is outlined in specific detail how the West and its regional allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia, were already funneling in cash and arraying armed sectarian extremists against Hezbollah inside of Lebanon and against the government of Syria. Hershs report even included a retired CIA agent who portended the sectarian nature of the impending, regional conflict. There is no denying that this premeditated conspiracy described in 2007 has now been brought to full fruition in the form of a increasingly horrific sectarian conflict the West is now poised to further expand by injecting a half-billion dollars into terrorist operations in direct support of ISIS campaigns on both sides of the Syrian-Iraqi border. For the NYT to claim injecting more cash and weapons into efforts to topple governments currently fighting Al Qaedas various regional franchises is some sort of attempt to contain spillover is disingenuous at best, and at worst a poor attempt to cover up what is essentially Washingtons open state sponsorship of the largest terrorist force ever assembled in modern history.

"THE FIRST YEAR The union is in a state of deep and justifiable anxiety about jobs and mortgages and two long, bloody wars. President Barack Obama did not create these problems, and none could be solved in one year. But 2009 offered powerful and, at times, bruising lessons for a new president struggling to fulfill the seismic promise of his election. Obama's first State of the Union address, delivered after this editorial was published, was a chance to show what he has learned and to tell Americans how he intends to govern in the next three years. There is no denying the world's relief that Obama is very much not George W. Bush. He is managing the necessary exit from Iraq. His decision to send additional troops to Afghanistan (the necessary war President Bush disastrously neglected) was courageous and strategically sound. He leads global climate talks instead of sneering at them. At home, Obama won an economic recovery bill that was too small but staved off an even deeper recession. He raised fuel standards for cars and appointed Sonia Sotomayor to a Supreme Court that had been drifting dangerously rightward. That is good but not enough. Unemployment is still 10 percent. Bankers and their lobbyists (and much of Capitol Hill) are resisting essential financial reforms. The political climate in Washington is venomous. The Democratic Party is scared of its own shadow. The Republicans' only legislative plan is to carp and filibuster. We respect Obama's deliberative nature, and we, too, would like to see bipartisan cooperation. In 2009, Obama underestimated the Republicans' determination to block anything he proposed. When the economy was imploding only three Republican senators voted for the absolutely essential stimulus bill; none agreed to back health care reform or to even vote to end a filibuster. While he was deliberating and negotiating, Obama let his critics define and distort his policies. The public has not forgotten the summer of death panels. Obama needs to be tougher, faster and clearer going forward. If the Republicans want to continue to block bills that the country wants and needs, he should let them filibuster so the public can take notice. (Last December, the Republicans in the Senate tried to block the annual defense spending bill because an extension of unemployment benefits was attached to it. After that mischief failed, they voted for the bill in overwhelming numbers.) Rather than scaling back health care reform to court Republicans, he might try challenging them to come up with a serious plan -- one that provides real security for all Americans and has a real chance of controlling costs. While Obama needs to be tougher and more vocal, it would be a mistake for him to conclude that what's needed is shrill populism and a lurch to the left. After their taxpayer-financed bailout, he is right to call for additional taxes on the big banks. (And he should support the drive in the House to tax bankers' obscene bonuses.) But he must address the core issues that brought the economy to near ruin and insist on rigorous reforms of the financial system. Obama was right to propose a bipartisan panel on deficit reduction, and it was hypocritical of Senate Republicans to refuse to vote on it. We are as concerned as most Americans about the deficit, but right now the country does not need Obama to be a deficit hawk. The lesson of 2009 was that Americans need jobs and help with their mortgages. The private sector seems unlikely to propel a self-sustaining recovery any time soon. That means more stimulus spending, not less, certainly much more than the $154 billion jobs bill the House has passed. In a year as president, Obama has often reminded us that he is a gifted orator, able to inspire with grand vision and with the simple truth frankly spoken. The State of the Union was a good chance to address the big debates, to make clear that he would press ahead with health care and challenge the Republicans to work with him or get out of the way. It was long in coming. JAPAN AND THE AMERICAN BASES It took the United States and Japan a decade to negotiate a deal that would reduce the number of American troops on Okinawa and reposition those that remain. Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, is refusing, so far, to commit to the agreement, and the Obama administration is being less than patient. Before any serious damage is done to this important alliance, both countries must work harder to find a compromise. The 2006 agreement was designed to lessen tensions between Okinawans and the more than 20,000 American troops they host. The deal includes moving 2,000 Marines from the Futenma U.S. Marine air station in the city of Ginowan to the less populated Nago on Okinawa's northern coast, and relocating 8,000 other Marines to Guam. Before his party's landslide election in August, Hatoyama called for moving the base off of Okinawa or out of Japan altogether. The Pentagon got off to a bad start by insisting that Tokyo abide by its commitments. Hatoyama now says that he will defer any decision until May. Nago's newly elected mayor has announced that he doesn't want the Marines to move to his city. We hope the Obama administration shows flexibility and patience when two senior officials visit Japan for security talks this week. They should encourage Hatoyama to prove his commitment to being an 'equal partner' by offering solutions. And the United States must make a more compelling case for stationing troops in Japan. (There are another 20,000 American troops stationed elsewhere in Japan or just off the coast.) The alliance is more important than the basing agreement. But the longer the agreement is in limbo, the more it stirs questions about the future of the alliance. There are worrying signs that many of Japan's new leaders and its postwar generation don't understand the full value of the security partnership. A half-century of American protection remains a bargain for the Japanese. In much of Asia, it's seen as an essential balance against a rising China and a defense, if needed, against North Korea. The United States must respect Hatoyama's desire to strike a more independent course, including by seeking improved ties with China. A strong and equal partnership between Tokyo and Washington is in both countries' overwhelming interest. SO IT'S GRANNY'S FAULT? With its trysting governor and 'you lie!' congressman, South Carolina has suffered more than its share of politician-induced embarrassment. Now Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer has topped them, cruelly equating government help for the poor to 'feeding stray animals.' Bauer, who is running for governor, told a conservative political crowd about his grandmother's warning against feeding strays. 'You know why? Because they breed!' boomed the popular Republican. 'You're facilitating the problem if you give an animal or a person ample food supply. They will reproduce, especially ones that don't think too much further than that.' He eschewed what he described as political correctness and sternly called for the state to 'curtail that type of behavior' by taking away assistance if the parents of children receiving subsidized lunches don't show up for school conferences. 'You show me the school that has the highest free and reduced lunch, and I'll show you the worst test scores, folks,' said Bauer. In casting himself as the candidate of heartless civics, if not nitwit eugenics, Bauer at least stirred an encouraging furor. Outraged residents point out that South Carolina has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation, with unemployment rising to 12.6 percent in a Great Recession the poor hardly caused. Fifty-eight percent of the state's students receive subsidized lunches. Now watch Bauer backpedal. He insists he was a victim of the media, not his own overreach in the politics of class resentment. But his words are out there. With a lieutenant governor like Bauer in the wings, it's become clearer why the South Carolina Legislature declined to impeach Gov. Mark Sanford for going AWOL at taxpayers' expense in pursuit of his mistress. Voters should make Bauer eat his words. INTERNET VOTING, STILL IN BETA Internet voting is in its infancy, and still far too unreliable, but states are starting to allow it and the trend is accelerating because of a new federal law that requires greater efforts to help military and other overseas voters cast ballots. Men and women in uniform must have a fair opportunity to vote, but allowing online voting in its current state could open elections up to vote theft and other mischief. It is often hard for military voters to get ballots, and because of distance and unreliable mail service, it can be difficult or impossible for them to meet election deadlines. A year ago, the Pew Center on the States found that more than one-third of states do not provide military voters stationed abroad with enough time to vote, or are at high risk of not providing enough time. To address this problem, the new Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act requires states in most cases to get ballots to military and overseas voters well in advance of regularly scheduled federal elections. But the value of removing roadblocks is undermined when votes are put at risk, which can happen when ballots are returned by e-mail or are actually cast on a Web site. Massachusetts recently enacted a law allowing service members to vote by e-mail overseas. According to Verified Voting, a group that works to ensure reliable elections, 16 states allow some form of Internet voting, and more than a dozen -- including Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois and Washington -- are considering it. E-mail can be intercepted, and voting Web sites can be hacked or taken down by malicious attacks. There are not even agreed-upon standards for what safety measures are necessary. In many cases, it is not possible to ensure a secret ballot when votes are cast online or by e-mail. That is a particular concern for military voting, where soldiers could come under pressure from commanding officers about their choice of a candidate. The Internet can help improve overseas voting if it is used wisely. It can be a good way to get information about elections and candidates out to faraway voters, and to deliver blank ballots. Right now, those ballots should not be returned online. ",1
"Medical workers in parts of Syria have been forced to let the wounded bleed to death for lack of bandages, and have opted to use catheter bags meant for urine to administer intravenous fluids to newborns because proper drip bags are gone.Expectant mothers in areas vulnerable to shelling and bombing give birth by cesarean section rather than risk natural childbirth in an attack. Malnourished children are eating animal feed and leaves, in some cases only miles from warehouses full of food. Families are burning mattress stuffing and plastic scraps for heat.Those are among some of the details in a Save the Children report issued Tuesday night about the challenges confronting Syrian civilians in 18 areas across the country that the United Nations has defined as besieged, meaning they are surrounded by armed antagonists who have severely restricted aid delivery and freedom of movement.At least a quarter-million children are among the inhabitants of such areas, which have been effectively turned into â€œopen-air prisons,â€ the report said. It drew on data from the United Nations and other organizations, as well as Save the Childrenâ€™s interviews with local aid groups, doctors, teachers and civilians, including 126 mothers, fathers and children who reside in these areas.â€œThey and their families are cut off from the outside world, surrounded by warring groups that illegally use siege against civilians as a weapon of war, preventing food, medicine, fuel and other vital supplies from entering and stopping people from fleeing,â€ the report said.The war has shown little or no sign of ending, despite a partial cease-fire reached last month under international pressure between the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and an array of insurgent opponents.Issued as the war is entering its sixth year, the Save the Children report did not provide new statistics about the extent of suffering in the country, where half the population has been displaced and 250,000 to 470,000 have been reported killed.Yet the details in vignettes provided by civilian victims in the besieged areas added to the sense of desperation in a conflict in which images of bombed hospitals and maimed and starving children are no longer considered shocking.â€œThe medical station here is no more than a table, a sterilizer and piece of gauze,â€ a mother in eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, said in the report. â€œEven the wounded are left to die because there are no materials available to save their lives.â€Others said surgeons improvised by operating in candlelight and using old water hoses as ventilation tubes. â€œFamilies scour the streets for discarded blankets, cloths or scraps of cloth that can be boiled â€” in an attempt to sterilize them â€” and used as bandages,â€ the report said.In some areas where there are no doctors, the report said, others step in, including poorly trained volunteers. In one besieged community, the main health provider was a veterinarian. Three of the eight doctors left in Moadamiyeh, a besieged suburb of Damascus, were trained as dentists.Medical workers in Moadamiyeh faced a dilemma when they ran out of intravenous drip bags for newborns and could not get more. â€œTheir only option was to use bags normally used for catheters,â€ the report said. â€œMany lives were saved, but three infant children died of infections.â€In the city of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria, where water is available once a week for three hours, chlorine supplies ran out last June, the report said, drawing attention to what it called the irony of chlorineâ€™s dual use. â€œWhile many besieged areas struggle to find chlorine to purify water,â€ it said, â€œparties to the conflict have reportedly used chlorine gas to attack and kill civilians.â€Despite repeated United Nations Security Council demands and the tenuous â€œcessation of hostilitiesâ€ agreement, the report said, only a fraction of the emergency aid needed has reached the besieged areas.In a separate report on the depths of the Syrian crisis, World Vision International, a Christian relief advocacy group, collaborated with Frontier Economics, a European consultancy, to calculate the cost of the war to Syria, based partly on the countryâ€™s economic projections had the war never happened. Should peace be somehow achieved this year, their report said, the cost could total nearly $700 billion. If ended by 2020, the cost would grow to $1.3 trillion, roughly the annual gross domestic product of Spain.â€œThis is lost money,â€ Conny Lenneberg, World Visionâ€™s regional leader for the Middle East and Eastern Europe, said in the reportâ€™s introduction. â€œIt will never be recovered, never be spent to provide education, health care, safe environments, livelihoods or a future for children.â€",1

While itâ€™s pretty clear that monkeys arenâ€™t humans â€” weâ€™re distant relatives, separated by 25 million years of evolution â€” monkeys too, tend to become less social with age.â€œThis clearly tells us that we, as humans, are not unique in the way we age socially but that there might be an evolutionary â€˜deepâ€™ root in this pattern,â€ said Alexandra Freund, a developmental psychologist at the University of Zurich who worked on the study published in Current Biology. How human behavior changes as we age could therefore have some biological origins.Dr. Freund, along with Julia Fischer, who studies primate cognition at the German Primate Center in Goettingen, Germany, and their colleagues, wanted to know how age influenced the behavior of more than 100 Barbary macaque monkeys living in an enclosed 50-acre park in southern France. They studied how the monkeys, ranging in age from 4 to 29 (which is about 105 in human years, according to Dr. Fischer), responded to physical objects like novel toys and tubes baited with food; social interactions like grooming â€œfriendsâ€ or fighting; and social information, like photos or calls of â€œfriendsâ€ and â€œstrangers.â€The researchers found that the monkeysâ€™ interest in toys waned when they became reproductive. And around 20, (their â€œretirement ageâ€) monkeys, like humans, had fewer social contacts and approached others less frequently. What surprised the researchers is that this apparent withdrawal wasnâ€™t driven by a social tendency to avoid old monkeys: Younger monkeys still approached and groomed their elders. And it wasnâ€™t that older monkeys just werenâ€™t interested in anything: They still responded to photos of other monkeys and hissed at others during fights. â€œThey are still very much tuned into whatâ€™s going on,â€ said Dr. Fischer. â€œBut they donâ€™t want to participate themselves.â€Dr. Freund said she sees the same behavior patterns in humans.The dominant psychological theory to explain this in people is that we become more choosy with age in order to maximize the use of the time we have left with death in sight. While monkeys have excellent memories, there is no evidence that they are aware of their impending deaths. So if both humans and monkeys act similarly, perhaps this theory is just a way of rationalizing a natural behavior with biological roots, said Dr. Fischer.Perhaps monkeys and humans just lose stamina with age, and maybe the monkeys are too tired to deal with relationships that are ambivalent or negative, she added. Or maybe, as the researchers are now trying to investigate, aging monkeys are less socially interactive because they tend to take fewer risks, which is what appears to happen in humans according to some research.Whatever the reason behind the behavior of these distantly-related species is, thereâ€™s a take-home message for humans: â€œOur behaviors that seem very much the result of our deliberation and choice,â€ said Dr. Freund, â€œmight be more similar to our primate ancestors than we might think.â€",1
"The nine-year-old Dutch boy who was the only survivor of a plane crash that killed 103 people said he is in a lot of pain but keen to go home, in his first comments published on Friday. Ruben van Assouw could remember nothing of Wednesday's disaster and was not yet aware that his parents and 11-year-old brother had died in the accident, the Dutch newspaper Telegraaf reported. 'My name is Ruben and I am from Holland,' Telegraaf reported on a telephone conversation with the sole survivor of the Afriqiyah Airways crash at Tripoli airport. 'I am fine, but my legs hurt a lot,' the boy told a reporter from the newspaper on the mobile phone of one of his doctors. 'I am in a hospital,' Ruben told the newspaper. 'There are men and women here. I don't know how I got here, I don't know anything more,' he said. 'I really want to go home.' Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi's eldest son, Seif al-Islam, visited the boy on Thursday at the hospital in the capital where he is recovering after surgery on his smashed legs, the official Jana news agency reported. Islam had 'asked about the health of the Dutch boy and about the treatment he is receiving from doctors at Al-Khadra hospital,' the Libyan news agency reported. The boy and his family had been returning from a safari holiday in South Africa. He has only been identified by the Dutch foreign ministry as Ruben but more fully by Dutch media as Ruben van Assouw. He greeted an aunt and uncle with a smile when they arrived at his Tripoli bedside on Thursday and would be transported to the Netherlands as soon as his medical condition allowed, a doctor said. Officials said 70 Dutch citizens, including Ruben's family, were among the 103 people killed when the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 from Johannesburg disintegrated on landing on Wednesday. The Dutch newspaper Brabants Dagblad said the boy was probably from Tilburg in the southern Netherlands and that he had been on safari in South Africa with his mother Trudy, 41, father Patrick, 40, and brother Enzo, 11. Siddiq ben Dilla, the doctor who operated on the boy, said on Thursday that he was 'getting better' and could return to the Netherlands in the next few days. 'His family is with him now,' the doctor told selfnews. 'His memory is good: as soon as his relatives walked in he smiled, and was happy to see them.' ",1
"This Music Festival Will Challenge the Two-Party SystemBy Claire Bernish However, the UWSF is much more than just a music festival. As a platform for voices of every race, color, and creed, the 2015 UWSF is an educational event combining activism, information to challenge the two-party political duopoly, practical solutions for both political and non-political issues, and the arts. The UWSF focuses on bringing positive and conscious artists together with political leaders and thinkers with hopes of ending the divisiveness and partisan stalemate currently consuming the nation. During such a tumultuous time of injustice and hostility as weve witnessed in Ferguson, Baltimore, and around the country, Free and Equals initiatives have sparked a peaceful, positive, and powerful movement for effective, potent solutions. Free and Equal hopes the festival will help propel independent political thought and action far beyond the spectrum of Republican vs. Democrat. The UWSF will feature Civil Rights leader Amelia Boynton Robinson as the keynote speaker, as well as Professor Griff from Public Enemy, conscious reggae artist Spragga Benz, journalist Amber Lyon, and a host of other musicians, artists, activists and thinkers from around the country. Free and Equal is expecting even more well-known artists to confirm their participation in the UWSF as we get closer to the event date on September 19th. Tickets for the festival became available online today, but organizers are expecting tickets to the event to sell out quickly. Reserve yours here. Claire Bernish writes for theAntiMedia.org. Anti-Media Radio airs weeknights at 11pm Eastern/8pm Pacific. Claire Bernish joined Anti-Media as an independent journalist in May of 2015. Her topics of interest include social justice, police brutality, exposing the truth behind propaganda, and general government accountability. Born in North Carolina, she now lives in Ohio. Learn more about Bernish here! The entire supposed left-right political divide we take for granted as being a meaningful description of reality is false. The real divide in political systems is between extractive and inclusive. Extractive systems run the gamut of other political labels fascist, communist, oligarchy, or just thuggish dictatorship but they all funnel the fruits of their populations labor upward to a ruling elite through a variety of mechanisms. Inclusive systems have a rule of law that applies equally to all classes, hears the voices of all classes, is open to all classes to participate on an equal footing in the economy, and allows all classes to keep the fruits of their labor under laws that protect private property. Currently, neither mainstream political party believes or practices inclusiveness. I wish the UWSF much success. ",0
"1 | Break gender norms in childhood Itâ€™s important to implement gender sensitisation through education as early as primary school. Trying to bring about a change in mindset about what roles are â€œtraditionallyâ€ for women (such as care work) is crucial to creating a more open and accepting society. Fiza Farhan, global strategic development advisor, Lahore, Pakistan @Fiza_Farhan 2 | Work with religious and traditional leaders For most parts of northern Nigeria, some discriminatory norms can be tackled by the involvement of religious and traditional leaders. After sensitisation and behaviour change, a man would not restrict his wifeâ€™s or daughterâ€™s involvement in any economic activity. Titus Orngu, gender technical adviser (Women Peace & Security Programme), UN Women, Yola-Adamawa, Nigeria 3 | Encourage employers to hire inclusively We must create awareness about the potential of women in the workplace. When it comes to supporting lower-income women who may not have high levels of formal education, itâ€™s important to help employers realise the value of competency over credentials. Letâ€™s encourage employers to look beyond a CV (which is merely a proxy for the skills they want to hire) and instead focus on the competencies our youth posses (both men and women). This will lead to more inclusive hiring practices. Noella Moshi, programmes lead, WAVE Academies, Lagos, Nigeria  4 | Pass a gender equality law Legislation â€“ such the gender and equal opportunities bill (GEOB) â€“ would go a long way in addressing some of the discrimination that women face. It would adddress the issues of inheritance rights and property/land ownership.    Related: Youth in development: 'We're tired of being the topic, not the leaders'   One of the reasons the GEOB was represented at the National Assembly was because of pressure from influential women and groups. Though the bill was previously thrown out, the lawmakers said that it could be presented again. Elections will soon be here and no one would like to test the power of women voters. The majority of women in Nigeria â€“ including those in the Boko Haram-ravaged north-east â€“ stood in the sun, rain and in the face of attacks to vote. Titus Orngu  5 | Get women access to capital Women run 30% of all registered businesses worldwide, yet only 10% of women entrepreneurs have access to the capital they need to grow. Partnerships are crucial: mobilising the skills and resources of public and private sectors creates a bigger impact than working in isolation. For example, for our Road to Growth project, we involved a bank in designing our training curriculum on financial literacy, and also organised events with the bank and the women entrepreneurs to build relationships. Itâ€™s not enough to simply teach women about financial literacy; financial service providers must also offer the right kinds of products and services. And of course the right legislation is critical for women to have land rights, collaterals and access to loans. Annabel Azim, enterprise development programme director, Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, London, UK 6 | Recognise informal workers Most of the worldâ€™s poor, especially in developing countries, are working, and of the estimated 630 million working poor, the majority are women. The primary challenge is that most of those cannot work their way out of poverty because most earn their living in the informal economy where average earnings are low while costs and risks are high. In Nigeria, the value of the informal economy has been estimated at 7.615tn naira ($48.2bn). And yet the activities â€“ the livelihoods â€“ of these workers remain almost entirely unrecognised, valued or taken into account in urban planning or local economic development. If urban poverty, inequality and unemployment are to be reduced, urban informal workers, especially the working poor, need to be recognised, valued and supported as economic agents who contribute to the economy and to society. Victoria Okoye, urban advocacy specialist, Wiego, Accra, Ghana   Related: Why arenâ€™t we designing cities that work for women, not just men?   7 | Make travel safer for women We need to integrate women more effectively through infrastructure. For instance, our Nigerian Infrastructure Advisory Facility has connected millions of women to employment: an estimated 550,000 trips have been taken by women, facilitated through these improved transport networks. The GEMS3 programme identified that women are less likely than men to travel when challenges such as bad roads prevent them from doing so. Removing obstacles to travel will have a disproportionately favourable impact on women. Adanma Abalunam, project manager on the Growth and Employment in States (GEMS3) programme, Adam Smith International, Abuja, Nigeria 8 | End violence against women at home and work I did research last year on masculinities, conflict and violence in Nigeria [pdf] that found that womenâ€™s difficulties within the home increase as their earning power grows, particularly if they earn more than men. At the same time, we also need to look at violence women experience in the workplace. Most women in Nigeria I know who have set up their own business or work for a company or organisation have experienced sexual harassment. This has a detrimental impact on womenâ€™s wellbeing at work as well as their motivation. In some cases, men often will not allow daughters, wives or sisters to work outside the home (although many still engaged in home-based businesses) â€œfor their own protectionâ€ and to guard against this violence. Chitra Nagarajan, activist and writer, Maiduguri, Nigeria @chitranagarajan 9 | Teach boys to respect women Thereâ€™s a long-term role that parents must play in raising our sons better. I grew up believing many things to be true that I have now found to be unfavourable to the development of women and opportunities. My son, and every boy in his generation, must be educated about equality and that it is the role of any human to support another, as men must women. Gbenga Sesan, executive director, Paradigm Initiative Nigeria, Lagos, Nigeria @gbengasesan 10 | Use emergencies as opportunities   Related: Where are the women of colour in non-profits' tech departments?   In emergency situations, individuals often turn to opportunities for immediate economic relief where dependents have no alternative but to â€œallowâ€ women to enter the labour force. So while this may not necessarily lay the foundation for long-term change in society, organisations and the civil society need to use this situation to their advantage. Providing short vocational training for women to improve their skills and make them more favourable for employment will empower them. The government would need to implement policies and task forces to ensure that economic progress is not halted when these women return to their communities. Fiza Farhan 11 | Look at wider inequality in Nigeria In Nigeria, the gap between the rich and poor is massive and has been growing. This can be seen by the fact that even when GDP was growing, youth employment was falling. We need to look at womenâ€™s economic empowerment, but we also need to look at economic inequality in Nigeria in general. We need to move away from a system of kleptocratic politicians and officials as well as rampant capitalism and its models of growth that have harmed so many women and girls and exacerbated economic inequality. We need a model of economic development and growth that is much more socially and environmentally conscious and focuses on ensuring the whole of society, not just the wealthy few, benefit from economic growth.

"DARPA: Genetically Modified Humans for a Super Soldier ArmyBy Paul A. Philips The genetic modificationof specific human genes will give these soldiers certain characteristics advantageous on the battlefield, giving rise to the most amazing abilities and performances. Smarter, sharper, more focused and more physically stronger than their enemy counterparts these soldiers will be capable of telepathy, run faster than Olympic champions, lift record-breaking weights through the development of exoskeletons, re-grow limbs lost in combat, possess a super-strong immune system, go for days and days without food or sleep Then theres the emotional side. These soldiers will have the empathy genes deleted and show no mercy, while devoid of fear Even more disturbingly, the Human Assisted Neural Devices program involving brain control allows the joystick remote operation of soldiers from some far away control center. All this has been revealed, even in mainstream media. In spite of the secrecy, fiction writer Simon Conway was allowed into the Pentagons DARPA and given a guided tour Doesnt this suggest that DARPA are well into the final stages and they want us to get used to the idea of a genetically modified super soldier army? The type of super human characteristics that have been developed (or are in the development stages) in the soldiers is indicated by funding allocations. For example, DARPA has handed out a $40 million grant to California and Pennsylvania Universities to develop memory-controlling implants. It has also been revealed that DARPA awarded $9.9 million to the Institute for Preclinical Studies Texas AM University to develop a means of surviving significant blood loss. This would overcome the normal difficulties in requiring life-saving medical treatment immediately after combat injury which is known to be difficult to give during the complications and dangers encountered on the battlefield. Another characteristic in development is having the soldiers genetically modified to hibernate throughout winter. There is a gene in squirrels that produces an enzyme in the pancreas which enables this ability. This gene can be taken from the squirrel and inserted into solders 1. It has to be remembered that wars are secretly manufactured for power, profit and political gain. So all the massive funding gone into these projects only goes into supporting false pretexts created by thepowers that befor their own selfish means to an end...regardless of the consequences. Theres never enough money for humanity but always a blank check for war 2. As history has shown us, any advantage created will sooner or later be matched by the enemy. Human genetic modification technology for military advantages shouldnt be any different and will be matched as a response by the enemy after their realization that the technology exists. Indeed, this in effect cancels out any advantages as in the historic case of the nuclear arms race with the political superpowers and now with the global drone arms race. 3. Are we civilians next? Will the genetic modification technology extend into civilians? Rather than give us anything to our advantage will it be used for dumbing down and control in a scientific dictatorship? What about those memory-controlling implants mentioned? Consider the sinister implications: Remember the Arnold Schwarzenegger filmTotal Recall involving false memory implants? 4. When it comes to genetic modification there are always the dangers related to tinkering with life: What about the long-term consequences and the spread of these genes over generations? What about the potential irreversible damages as in those related to the transhumanist agenda? As Geoffrey Ling, DARPA director at the Technologies Office, said to Agence France Presse It is risky Well, he should know! 5. Last but not least there are the ethical considerationsWhat will be the humanitarian cost? Could this by design lead us down the road to Hell? Image Credit: HULC Exoskeleton Lockheed Martin You can read more from Paul A. Philips at his site NewParadigm.ws The Island of doctor Moreau, enough said. memory-controlling implants. I thought that was a scar from a poor marksman. OH WELL there is always tomorrow, try harder. Everyone wants to up you but are afraid it will be flagged and name on a list. Are you kidding???? If you are commenting on this site you are already on the list and flagged!! YES,, And it keeps moving around, it`s in a different place or it`s shaped different or it`s gone !? It is clear that the hospital-bombing war criminal now in power in this country, along with his retinue of Marxists, muslims and morons, is planning to turn this country into District 12 of the world government. Discussions have been held with Canada and Mexico about military integration and United Nations troops are about to start operating on our soil along with militarized and federally-controlled police as part of Operation Strong Cities, which will weed out extremists opposed to the regime. The military is being systematically purged of any religious believers, who might feel scruples or compunctions at certain acts of violence, and officers are being promoted or not based on their willingness to use violence against the civilian population. Now it appears that this is but a prelude to genetically-engineered soldiers capable of doing anything the government orders them to with superhuman strength and efficiency. These are to be the Peacekeepers of the new world order: we are going to have Hunger, but it wont be a Game. Think positive. They are still part human and therefore taste like pork when cooked properly. I am not opposed to hunting mutant soldiers for sport and consumption. sick,sick, sick! Im not so keen on the cannibalism aspect of that, but hunting them down and killing them is a definite necessity!! This is something Putin or that moe-ron in N. Korea would come up with. The fact that OUR government has done it should have EVERYONE screaming for Obamas head on a pike! They have given them drugs in the past and did not tell them. Just hope they are telling them about this experiment. You cant genetically alter an already existing human being. These are grown in test tubes or possibly surrogate mothers in a lab! They are not human, they are experiments in genetically altered organisms. They are not persons, they are government owned weapons. They will never walk among us as equals they will be oppressors under the control of the ruling elite!! If this is true the program should be shut down immediately, the principles involved locked in prison, and any existing super soldiers destroyed immediately!! What were these moe-rons thinking?????? They are doing some of this testing on soldiers, like keeping the helicopter Pilot up for 40 hrs. Listen to the video. What they want is a soldier with the physica mental Capacity to adept in combat period Research Plum Island,, You`ll be amazed at what they do !!! Every once in a while, SOMETHING escapes !! They are thinking they have created slaves!! How long before these programs begin looking for ways to alter pre existing humans rather than having to creat new ones? It would speed up their power grab tremendously and would ensure that nobody was safe from their experiments/control. Test tubes? Youve been reading too much science fiction. Genetic modification is absolutely possible. your wrong on that aspect of test tube babies Im all for that pike!! Soilent (GMO) Green Ecological Enforcers, with some fava beans, and a nice chianti! Um Um Good! well Im glad because when it comes to small arms weaponry I dont I dont miss and i like pork YepThat about sums it up I personally think this is more BS on the web.Where might you have gained this insight. Of district 12 of world government and the UN forces? We make up a large portion of UN forces already. Our constitution would require amending to allow any foreign or domestic military forces for policing. Although they would probably hide the military behind actual police units. I do believe any uniforms outside of the official dress of officers excluding plain close should be considered as militarization. If the national guard are utilized they should not be armed either unless they are sworn to uphold our civilian laws as deputys . Then they have discression like other officers and are no longer bound by a military chain of command structure. And yet when Bush did all this you didnt have any issues. Shows what hypocrites you people are. I doubt you have any idea what Marxism even is aside from American propaganda. If these soldiers have no emotion or empathy, what happens when they get home to their families??? Have to be nuts to submit to this. I hope they are getting their consent, they have not in the past on some of their experiments. Who said anything about going home! Never thought of that, damn. Like I said, hope they are getting consent and it is explained to them. A soulless army Hope I never see the day. You and I probably wont, but my poor grand and great grandchildren will. Ill say a prayer. I hope I never see it. I am a Nam vet also. Welcome home brother Thanks Mike, welcome home. Same to you Thank you for your service to your/our country. My uncle was in Nam. My humble thanks, from all us NAM vets! These are experiments! Theres no families involved! These are soldiers with TEST TUBES for mommy and daddy PROPERTY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT!! Just what we need: An army of soldiers that are superior physically and mentally, non-emotional, no morals, completely obiedient to their masters (the US Government) rather than to US the people. If this isnt stopped immediately, we are done as a country! Well be a suburb of the UN with these super-soldiers taking care of the police work worldwide = one world government with someone like Obama in charge!! NOT GOOD!!! Morally reprehensible!! HIGHLY ILLEGAL!!!! COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! The dumbing down started in the 70s and each generation since! When you rewrite history, pass kids because no child should be left behind, grade on a learning curve and the teacher unable to control the classroom..well, you get what you asked for. brainless to follow any order? It is a shame that there isnt a similar project to improve politicians to be more honest, have integrity, empathy and love America more than themselves and money. Are you kidding??? Now you want super-politicians???? The ones we have, have totally screwed us over and screwed up the country (and working on the world now) and you want to create SUPER versions of them???? The only project we need is one to eliminate politicians and lawyers THEY should all be recycled!! The next step is totally autonomous mechanical soldiers can be made much quicker than growing them in test tubes and they can be repaired in the motor pool instead of the hospital, they NEVER question orders, and the do what they are commanded to do by their masters!! These super soldiers are only an interim step to the final product totally obedient servants perfect for keeping the riff raff under the thumb of the Master! You never took English Literature? I said I wanted improved politicians. Now take the lithium, and calm down. These new soldiers will be loved because Obama opened the military to accept and appease homosexuality. Thats absurd!! Yeah, I suppose homosexuality is a terrible thing, what people do in the privacy of their bedroom is an atrocity! In the name of true freedom, the government should force out homosexuals from the military, because thats what America is about! Freedom! And what happens to them when they get out of the service? They join the Democratic National Committee. The country is in enough trouble without having someone with no emotion or empathy running it, oops I forgot about POTUS. Oblowme was the prototype no super strength, or super-intelligence, just a knack for saying exactly what they think people want to hear and then doing the exact opposite of whatever was spoken about! Totally obedient to his masters! Right, and yet Bush does these things and its ok. Nobody thinks that what Bush did was okay. You are assuming that criticism of one partys figurehead implies support for the other which just isnt true. Everyone more or less wants the same outcome for the country and Im so sick of seeing everything being perceived under a partison lense. And please, spare me the republican anti-abortion rhetoric because I couldnt care less what you want to do to your body. Personally, I find the fanatics who sit online quoting irrelevant scripture passages to be some of the most annoying, misguided people Ive ever encountered. The deliberate ignorance these people cling to is counterproductive at best. But that doesnt mean the other side is any better. Secular fanatical groups claiming to do the right thing (like PETA for example) can be so ideologically driven that they too do more harm then good (PETA euthanizes more animals than any group or shelter, possibly even combined with a euthanization rate way over 50% despite having millions of extra dollars in revenue). So please, keep this in mind next to you decide to comment.. super soldiers will be property of the US Government they dont get out, they get replaced. In a society that has no problem murdering unborn babies in the womb for convenience, do you honestly think that these Super Soldiers grown in a test tube will EVER experience the freedom that we used to have??? These are Eco-fascists in charge, theyll recycle used up Super Soldiers! Probably use them to generate electricity or some such abhorrent use, but more than likely, theyll just incinerate them and start a new batch! These things can not exist in normal society they will be used for police, army, navy, air force, coast guard, national guard and theyll ONLY answer to their masters the political elite liberal progressive communists that currently control the Obama administration. My only hope at this point is that this is just some bodys idea of a sick joke!! If our Government has actually done this, then that government and EVERYBODY IN IT MUST GO!!! I cannot find anything wrong with you message. In fact, I agree 99.9%. Puts me in the mind of the movie, Soldier with Kurt Russell. Yeah, because how dare women choose what to do with their own bodies. In the name of freedom from the oppressive government, we should push legislation to force the government to remove womens rights, so that people are forced to live a lifestyle as we see fit! Thats true freedom, forcing my ideology on the world, and not allowing for any creativity outside of it! Wonder if all of these mass killings by young men, who are on a poly pharmacy of psychotropic medications, are either false flags or experiments gone bad. Take your pick! Probable answer ALL OF THE ABOVE!!! The memory implants are supposed to allow memory of committed atrocities to be deleted. If you believe that is all this government will use it for, I have several bridges and islands Id like to sell you!! People, there is no choice being offered! It will be a fact . Me you, most likely will not experience the full impact. To know the future of war fare , watch the latest science fiction war stories.. They are all predictions These things are NOT human! They may have been created using human genes, but as soon as they modified the DNA they became a new species! No moron, theyre humans. This is something that our congress MUST thoroughly investigateimmediately! These soldiers are American citizens, and will likely have no say in this matter. These soldiers, after finishing their tour of duty, will come home and live(think integrate) with the rest of us normal people, thereby creating a nightmare situation for them and for us. THIS DEFINITELY MUST NOT BE DONE WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL!! I dont give a flip if the lying thieves in Congress put their rubber stamp on it or not. Theyre the idiots that made it legal to murder hundred of thousands of unborn children and now were harvesting them for parts and we are paying for that atrocity as well!! Theyll approve anything thatll put money in their pockets. Remember theyre immune to laws prohibiting insider trading. And if this isnt an opportunity to cash in on an investment in technology then I dont know what is!!! I take it, then that you are all right with having to live alongside these returning soldiers who will be physically stronger, more intelligent, have a kill-or-be-killed mentality, and most likely be able to read your mind??NOT ME! Thats one reason I am voicing my opinion now. This is what Hitler did to the soldiers in Germany with super drugs, mainly opium and thats why they were acting superhuman until the end when they started declining in strength and dying. Ah. A history major. Opium.is a hullucinogen and a sedative that blurs reality to the point where a soldier cant tell if what they are shooting at or fighting is real or imagined. U.S. soldiers used that in Viet Nam. That is why there is a BIG Black wall in D.C.. You must have dabbled in opium yourself. Never touch drugs myself.I like to deal in reality and keep my wits about me. Learned this from a TV documentary on the subject. So this is what Planned Parenthood is doing with the baby body parts from abortion after they kill the babies and sell them to another middle group to get them to right places.. So why dont they just make slaves that do not fight back and exterminate the rest of us? China already has individuals that see in the dark . . . Didnt they try something like this before, and they ended up killing each other. Lol. Seems like they should be working on significant brain loss. Just saying. I take it they will have male/female versions for copulation or are they all super studs? if they are doing this, we will never hear about it 8/2/11 Supersoldier escapes aircraft carrierAugust 2 2011 at 5:52 PM There was a heavy set (arnold schwarzenegger looking) soldier in a some program in the bowels of an aircraft carrier. Either it happened, or he forsaw, that the carrier would be blown up, a huge internal fire, and the command decision was made Not to Release these soldiers, as their training/abilities were too much to be publicly known. (Super Seals??) This soldier knew this would happen, so in the second take of the dream, when i went back to sleep, he dived off the back of the carrier holdin a piece of floating equipment BEFORE the explosion was set, in order to avoid dying this way. He then was walking away along the dock, having swum to shore. The Men who stared at Goats can never be allowed to go home apparently. I volunteer to be a mutant patient, and be a real super soldier for my country. What about uplifting another species (like gorillas or salamanders) ",0
"Cool Berkeley-area dentist Marvin Wilson, DDS, has grown in popularity lately due to his laid-back attitude toward regular brushing and flossing, which he 'couldn't give two shits about,' according to sources. 'I asked him if I should be brushing differently, and he said people should just brush in whatever way makes them happy,' recalls longtime client Amanda Jefferies, 27. 'One time he started to warn me about gingivitis, but then he was like, 'You know what? Forget it. I can tell this is totally bumming you out.'' A receptionist confirmed there is currently a six-month wait to see Dr. Wilson, as his schedule is booked with patients needing extensive gum reconstruction. ",0
"Visitors to the central country of Nantou who become familiar with Chungliao township after the devastating 921 earthquake will have no trouble finding the building that houses A-mom's Dyeing Workshop, as it stands in the town as it did 10 years ago. The difference now is that very few customers are calling at the shop on Yungping Road, even on holidays or weekends. The flood of people that poured into the area after the 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck on Sept. 21, 1999 has trickled off and so has business at the hand dyeing shop. Established by a loosely formed group of local women after the earthquake, the shop sells items that are colored with dyes made from natural plants that grow in the nearby mountains. It also offers do-it-yourself classes for visitors to learn the basic techniques used by the over 10 mothers and housewives -- known as A-moms -- to dye the colorful pillows, cellphone pouches, sheets, notebooks and other items on sale at the shop. The women learned their craft from professionals provided by the Taipei-based ROC Community Resources Exchange Association, and the shop got off to brisk start after it officially opened in 2003 with financial assistance from the Council of Labor Affairs. However, the colorful dreams of the A-moms are being crushed by the bitter reality of fewer and fewer visitors over the years. 'We will not give up, because we don't want it to be just a flash in the pan, ' said Wu Mei-chen, manager of the workshop. In their efforts to revive the business, the women refurbished the run-down workshop and set up the classroom where visitors can learn and practice the basics of dyeing. 'At one point, we even hired fashion experts to teach us how to pose and model and this helped to attract some visitors and boost our revenues for a while,' said Wu. 'However, in the last two or three years, very few tourists have been calling at the workshop, and we'd be lucky if 10 people a day come by on weekends.' This is mainly because large crowds of people are no longer visiting the Chungliao area as they did after 921 earthquake, she said, adding that another factor is the township's relatively remote location. The variety of colorfully dyed products on display in the workshop are also not moving off the shelves because the women lack knowledge of the marketing process and government assistance has dried up, Wu said. The other women also expressed concern over the future of the business to which they have given so much time and effort and which now earns them only a few thousand New Taiwan dollars a month. One of the women, Chien Chien-mei, called for the government to assist them in exploring markets and setting up a system to certify their products. But the women are not sitting back and waiting. They are trying on their own to think of new ways to put the workshop back on its feet. 'We are mulling a transformation plan to achieve sustainable growth for the workshop, which we established from scratch, and we will continue to strive for its success despite the tremendous difficulties we are experiencing,' said Wu.

"During the second world war, Irina Rakobolskaya, who has died aged 96, was a member of the all-female Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment of the Red Army that became known as the â€œnight witchesâ€. The unit was secretly formed, with the authorisation of Joseph Stalin, in October 1941, with Adolf Hitlerâ€™s Wehrmacht at the gates of Moscow, and Rakobolskaya, then a 21-year-old physics student at Moscow State University, volunteered to join. She went on to become the regimentâ€™s chief of staff and a chronicler of its achievements. After the war, she returned to MSU and graduated in 1949. She forged a career in the physics of elementary particles and became professor of physics at the university, but her experience with the celebrated â€œnight witchesâ€ defined her long life. The daughter of a school teacher, Varvara (nee Shevlyakova), and a physics lecturer, Vyacheslav Rakobolsky, Irina was born in Dankov, 300km south of Moscow, on the river Don. The family moved to Moscow in 1932, after her fatherâ€™s death. Rakobolskaya was one of the few Soviet women to be admitted before the war to MSU, which she entered in 1938, a dark year in Soviet political history with Stalinâ€™s purges still under way. Three years later, with 17 other female students of MSU, she unhesitatingly forsook her studies to answer the call for women to join the Red Armyâ€™s air wing. She did so, she later said, not for Stalin or for the Communist party, but primarily for patriotic reasons: to defend her homeland. With her skills in physics and mathematics, she was trained as a navigator, but instead of flying, she was appointed regimental chief of staff, much to her initial disappointment. She cried because she wanted to fight on the front lines. But her regiment did so, flying an extraordinary 24,000 sorties, in tiny, flimsy biplanes, in three years â€“ all the way to Germany. Their stealthy, low-level, night-time bombing raids earned them the disparaging sobriquet â€œnight witchesâ€ from their German enemy; it was a term these young women embraced with pride. Despite initial doubts about their fighting capabilities on the part of their male Red Army comrades, the regiment won 23 Hero of the Soviet Union medals, the highest military award. Their valour came at a cost â€“ 32 dead â€“ which caused Rakobolskaya lasting grief. On 9 April 1944 she personally witnessed the death of 23-year-old Yevgeniya Rudneva, shot down in flames. After the war, Rakobolskaya kept the memory of these young women alive, publishing Rudnevaâ€™s diary and her own memoirs and poetry, giving numerous interviews, and participating in annual regiment reunions in front of the Bolshoi theatre in Moscow. She took her wartime conviction that â€œa woman can do anythingâ€ into her distinguished postwar career as a physicist at MSU. She studied cosmic rays â€“ high-energy particles flying all over the universe at approaching the speed of light. She authored or co-authored some 300 academic publications, including six books and a textbook on nuclear physics. She was appointed professor of physics in 1977, and from 1994 held the lifetime position of distinguished professor. From 1987 until 1997 she chaired the Union of Women at MSU. She became a member of the universityâ€™s academic council and of the Russian Academy of Sciencesâ€™ scientific council on cosmic rays. Between 1966 and 1990 she was a chair of a special department attended by professors from other universities to upgrade their knowledge and qualifications. A documentary on her life was broadcast on Russian television in 2013. She was honoured with numerous military and civil awards. Her husband, Dimitri Linde, whom she married in 1946, died in 2005. Rakobolskaya is survived by their two sons, Andrei and Nikolai. â€¢ Irina Vyacheslavovna Rakobolskaya, physicist and second world war veteran, born 22 December 1919; died 22 September 2016",1
"It was nearly 18 months ago, shortly after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, when a reporter for National Public Radio, Mara Liasson, observed at a White House press briefing that President Obama and his aides had â€œbent over backwardsâ€ to avoid using the phrase â€œradical Islam.â€ The press secretary, Josh Earnest, said this was because â€œthese terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion,â€ opening a debate over the phrase that has taken on new rancor amid the massacre in Orlando.â€œIn his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words â€˜Radical Islam,â€™ â€ Donald J. Trump said in a statement within hours of when Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and invoked the Islamic State in a 911 call. â€œFor that reason alone, he should step down.â€The next day, Mr. Obama called the focus on phrasing â€œa political distraction.â€â€œWhat exactly would using this label accomplish?â€ the president asked. â€œCalling a threat by a different name does not make it go away.â€What does â€œradical Islamâ€ even mean and why has it become so controversial? Is this argument just semantics, or does it go deeper?Letâ€™s start with the words. â€œIslamâ€ is a 1,500-year-old religion whose 1.6 billion followers worldwide observe a spectrum of customs and traditions. â€œRadicalâ€ can mean something very different or against tradition, or be defined as extreme views, practices and policies.The words, absent political context, could be read as trying to distinguish fringe interpretations of Islam, including justifications for violence, from the mainstream majority view, which is peaceful. But that context â€” including who shouts the phrase and who studiously avoids uttering it â€” has ladened it with pernicious meaning in particular quarters.Shadi Hamid, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that before the controversy began, he did not use the phrase â€œradical Islamâ€ much, but neither did he find it overly objectionable. After two years of politicization, though, Mr. Hamid and other analysts say the phrase has worrisome connotations, potentially maligning all Muslims or Islam itself.â€œWhy would you feel such a need to use this particular combination of words, when the vast majority of us agree that this is terrorism and that it should be stopped or countered?â€ he asked. â€œThese terms are being used as dog whistles.â€Will McCants, another Brookings scholar, told The Washington Post in December 2015 that â€œevery bit of that phrase is analytically unhelpfulâ€ because of its lack of specificity. â€œIs this the wine-drinking Islam of the poets?â€ he asked. â€œThe court Islam of the caliph? What kind of Islam are you even talking about?â€Republicans who invoke â€œradical Islamâ€ seem to be trying to telegraph certain arguments about Muslims, political correctness, and the United Statesâ€™ failure to stop the march of extremist groups across the Middle East. At the same time, Democrats who reject it are also making a political statement, one touching on Islamophobia and inclusiveness.If it seems unlikely that a single phrase with no fixed definition could contain all that information, the fight over â€œradical Islamâ€ becomes easier to understand when examined in its initial context: as a way to make sense of the rise of the Islamic State.Throughout late 2014, as the group, also known as ISIS and ISIL, conquered much of Iraq in a campaign of shocking violence, Americans struggled to discern what role, if any, religion played in its ideology. Because only 38 percent of Americans personally know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2014 Pew poll, most have little firsthand knowledge to go on.Mr. Obama, then and now, has tried to separate the terrorists from Islam, urging tolerance of Muslims in the United States and abroad.â€œAnd all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam, because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative,â€ he said in February 2015.Republicans slammed him for either ignorance or a misplaced sense of political correctness. In part because the president refused to use it, the phrase â€œradical Islamâ€ became a shorthand for everything he would not say about ISIS, and therefore, a way to accuse him of privileging sensitivity over forthrightness when discussing the threat the group posed.In its simplicity, the phrase reframes the daunting, confusing litany of problems that contribute to terrorism â€” faraway failed states, complex ideologies, a prevalence of guns â€” as something much easier to understand.â€œWe are at war with radical Islam,â€ Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said after the attacks in Paris last November. He likened Mr. Obamaâ€™s avoidance of the phrase to â€œsaying we werenâ€™t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but werenâ€™t violent themselves.â€Over time, the phrase morphed into a way for critics to explain why the Obama administration had failed to anticipate or stop the rise of the Islamic State.â€œYou cannot fight and win a war on radical Islamic terrorism if youâ€™re unwilling to utter the words â€˜radical Islamic terrorism,â€™ â€ Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said in January, back when he, too, was clamoring for the White House.Over time, â€œradical Islamâ€ has taken on darker connotations. Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Hamid of Brookings, â€œinvested these words with new meaning.â€As his campaign of anti-Muslim policy proposals and speech gained traction, Mr. Trumpâ€™s Republican rivals sought to match him. Mr. Cruz, for example, urged refusing Syrian refugees if they are Muslim. Ben Carson suggested Muslims should be barred from the presidency. They often invoked â€œradical Islamâ€ at the same time.The phrase does not explicitly say there is an intrinsic link between terrorism and Islam. But it suggests religion is the core issue, and by using the vague modifier â€œradical,â€ there is an implication that any adherent can be suspect on grounds that are unclear and open to interpretation.â€œTo term something â€˜radical Islamic violenceâ€™ condemns a religion,â€ Steven Cook, a Middle East scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in December, â€œand leaves one with the erroneous impression that the competing modern interpretations of Islam that specifically refute violent Islamismâ€™s worldview do not exist.â€Mr. Obama and others say that condemning â€œradical Islamâ€ does not make clear who is being condemned. That, they argue, risks exacerbating anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States, which has already grown violent.It also risks alienating Muslims abroad. Washington has long battled a perception in the Muslim world that it is at war with Islam, a perception that can feed anti-American sentiment and politics.At the same time, labeling ISIS â€œradical Islam,â€ in some eyes, legitimizes the groupâ€™s claims to represent an entire religion, when in fact most of its victims and enemies are themselves Muslim.â€œIf we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with the broad brush, and imply that weâ€™re at war with an entire religion, then weâ€™re doing the terroristsâ€™ work for them,â€ Mr. Obama said on Tuesday.Even before Mr. Trump took up the phrase as a mantra, Mr. Obama and others resisted it as part of a larger hesitation to discuss the Islamic Stateâ€™s use of religion as anything but false and cynical.But it is impossible to understand the Islamic Stateâ€™s ideology and recruiting power without acknowledging the role of religious beliefs that, while rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims, are often earnestly held.â€œIâ€™ve always been of the view that ISIS does have something to do with Islam,â€ Mr. Hamid said. â€œWe just have to talk about what that something is and do so in a nuanced, constructive way.â€He called it â€œproblematicâ€ that many Americans, including the president, do not seem â€œcomfortable speaking about religion as a motivating force or how it inspires violence or extremism, or that religion has a certain kind of power in everyday life in the Middle East.â€Hillary Clinton, perhaps in tacit acknowledgment of these concerns, has this week tried to take a middle path. She described the Orlando attack as â€œradical Islamismâ€ â€” a small but meaningful distinction; Islam is a religion, whereas Islamism a political ideology calling for Islamic government. She also declared, â€œIt matters what we do, not what we say.â€When I asked Mr. Hamid this, he countered with a different question. Given how many labels already exist to describe terrorists that draw on Islam, why insist on this one?He listed several â€” â€œradical jihadists, Salafis, Islamist extremists, jihadis, jihadi-Salafistsâ€ â€” none of which, he said, carry the baggage of â€œradical Islam.â€But if itâ€™s that baggage that repels scholars, it may also be what draws others. â€œRadical Islamâ€ has come to imply certain things about issues that are closer to home than abstract terrorist ideology: political correctness, migration, and the question of who belongs.Those same issues have animated debates over terrorism and terminology in other societies. In Germany, â€œmulticulturalismâ€ has become shorthand for larger questions of how to absorb migrants and whether there is a degree of minimum assimilation. There is endless sparring over â€œBritish values,â€ and what sort of burden this puts on migrants before they will be welcomed into society.France has had its own parsing of â€œradical Islam,â€ though the fight over â€œsecularismâ€ is even fiercer.Even majority Muslim societies have had versions of this same argument, Mr. Hamid pointed out. In Egypt, he said, the struggle over terms is, in part, a way of litigating whether parties like the Muslim Brotherhood are ideologically akin to terror groups â€” and therefore whether they should be allowed to participate in society.What these debates have in common is that arguing about how to define terrorism becomes a way to push and pull the contours of national identity, determining who is invited in to that identity and who is kept out.In every case, the debate is framed as one of pluralism versus security. Pinning terrorism on â€œmulticulturalismâ€ or non-secularism or foreign values or â€œradical Islamâ€ all portray inclusiveness as somehow threatening and exclusiveness as safer.The question of whether pluralism and security are indeed in tension, or whether pluralism in fact enhances security, is one that people around the world have long grappled with. But itâ€™s hard to discuss because it is so core to national identity. Debating semantics is much easier.",1
"â€˜The grown-ups are back in chargeâ€™ I think sheâ€™s the right person for the job. In general terms the mood has changed: it feels like the grown-ups are back in charge. It also helps that May has a hinterland, has experienced life outside Westminster and is interested in policy. It no longer feels as if decisions are being made as part of some game. Brexit is a key issue but it cannot dominate the whole of the governmentâ€™s agenda. We need to address insecurity: we should channel money and resources to the regions and trust in the sense of local institutions to spend it wisely.  James, 34, Devon â€˜The Leave campaign played on peopleâ€™s intoleranceâ€™ I hope the Tories under May continue to support economic growth, and work towards a budget surplus to pay off national debt.

The party needs to focus on the economy, in particular continue with the liberalising agenda under which they were elected last year.

The parties are splitting, parliament is broken, and I think they have lost their way. They are pandering to the right wing too much. Where is the pull to the centre ground?

Given the financial difficulties faced by Italy and Germany with their banks, the UK would be well to get out of the EU as soon as possible, so her â€œhard Brexitâ€ is the correct option, because it means we are not left holding the baby, paying to bail out all the rest of the countries in the EU when the euro collapses.  We must make good our escape, because when one of their banks needs help they all will, without state intervention it would be the end of a number of them, the end of the Euro, and the end of the EU.

The party is heading towards a â€œhard Brexitâ€, against its 2015 manifesto promises to remain in the single market. It has also decided that immigration was the main issue in the referendum. Whether this is a cynical ploy to attract Ukip voters is moot, as it is already damaging our reputation as an outward-facing, tolerant society and will surely impact on the efficiency of the NHS over time, not to mention British businesses.  The party seems to be willing to commit economic suicide in the name of a misguided appeal to â€œsovereigntyâ€.

She was not elected as Prime Minister, and the policies she appears to be championing did not appear in the Conservative party manifesto, which suggests that she has no mandate for anything she is doing.  After the lies that were told prior to the vote, there should be some form of honest fact-based appraisal of the cost - and benefit - of Brexit. I fear that this is going to drive the country into a long decline, when the party should be sorting the budget defecit and ensuring economic stability. Anonymous, 40, Berkshire",1
"When I am advising non-profits, I tell them that effective fundraising is part art, part science. You need structure and planning to support it, but you also need instinct and charisma to make it a success. Both sides are essential. The same is true of fundraisers themselves, great ones are typically all-rounders who can turn their hand to all components of income generation. There are specialisms, of course, but mostly fundraisers are expected to be jacks of all trades.  There are some characteristics and competencies commonly sought by charities, though, that in fact most fundraisers should not be expected to bring to the table. I have needed to steer many clients away from obsessing about these qualities when building fundraising teams and I would like to see this change. So, when searching for your next fundraiser, I recommend not prioritising the following: A â€˜black bookâ€™ of contacts The reasons people give to charities are simple: theyâ€™re passionate about the cause and they have been well cultivated by the organisation. A lot goes into what â€œwell cultivatedâ€ means, and while introductions from mutual contacts can go a long way, expecting fundraisers to bring a list of contacts with them is unrealistic and not recommended.  Itâ€™s better to hire an experienced and competent fundraiser who is totally new to your network than to choose a well-connected socialite who canâ€™t create a gift table or an engagement plan.  Fundraisers may have connections from previous roles, but many of those will be owned by other charities, or will be donors with no interest in a new cause. As a result poaching donors from your teamâ€™s rÃ©sumÃ© is bad practice, for both of you. The key is to hire great relationship builders, who can work your networks and events in order to find and engage your hottest prospects. Donâ€™t just recruit people who happen to have the phone numbers of people on a rich list. Corporate sector experience Experience in a variety of sectors can bring transferable skills â€“ but recruiters should not necessarily be looking for connections in the corporate sector, specifically from finance, with Â£ signs in their eyes. Having worked with wealthy people or companies does not mean someone will be comfortable, or proficient at, soliciting ex-colleagues, friends or family. Perhaps â€œinsider knowledgeâ€ can be valuable, but if itâ€™s not related to donations or partnerships, then itâ€™s not that relevant.  Qualities that promote success in the corporate world do not always translate to non-profits. It can be quite a significant transition, and the most frequent line I hear from people who make the switch is that they didnâ€™t realise it would be so hard to get money out of people for such good causes.  Enthusiasm and an MBA are, unfortunately, not enough to crack open the chequebooks of most donors, and the majority of charities do not have scope for a commercial income stream. Passsion for the cause Staff are certainly more likely to go above and beyond if they feel proud of what theyâ€™re doing, but passion alone cannot carry lacklustre fundraising practice.  Similarly, being an expert in the programmes of a charity does not mean someone will be good at raising money for it. The knowledge needed to raise money for a cause can be gained through a good induction process and a couple of weeksâ€™ revision â€“ and the ability to speak about it in an engaging way can come from one or two practice sessions. But gaining the skills to be a great fundraiser takes time and experience. Some of my biggest fundraising successes have been in contexts where I only fully understood what the charity did after my first week on the job. I am not alone in this â€“ a strong case could be made for the excellence and professionalism of fundraisers who are able to advocate for causes they do not particularly care about. Knowing when to bring other teams into conversations with donors is also important. Rather than concentrating on the above traits, my key recommendation when looking to hire fantastic fundraisers, especially for new or larger targets, is to prioritise candidates with experience of successful fundraising at a comparable level elsewhere.  Decide the skills and knowledge you need for your organisation, and look for a cultural fit, but always favour applicants who have demonstrated those in an equivalent fundraising context.

"A coalition of die-hard Cubs fans and Wrigley Field supporters introduced a drastic proposal at a Chicago city council meeting Tuesday, angrily calling for the demolition of the expensive, obsolete, 175-year-old city surrounding the beloved ballpark. Hundreds of devoted Wrigley Field advocates attended the public hearing as thousands of like-minded demonstrators gathered outside of City Hall, using chants, pamphlets, and signs to point out that the greater Chicagoland area is a decrepit eyesore and the outdated 10,856-square-mile urban sprawl should immediately be razed. 'It's truly a travesty that a hallowed franchise of Major League Baseball is still playing in a dilapidated city that should have been replaced decades ago,' said lead organizer Keith Garrison, addressing the assembly in a Ryne Sandberg jersey. 'I'm sure that to some of its more hardcore fans, Chicago has some charm in an antiquated way. But the greatest baseball team and fans in the world deserve something better than this dump.' 'It's more suburbs than city anymore, for crying out loud,' Garrison added. 'Instead of actually improving the place, they'll just keep adding more tacky stuff on until it's in danger of collapsing under its own weight.' Garrison, who presented a petition signed by more than 50,000 irate Cubs fans to mayor Rahm Emanuel, said that leveling the 234-square mile area immediately surrounding Wrigley Field would be 'an excellent start,' eliminating a decades-old blot on the landscape and providing an opportunity to construct a modern, multi-use metropolis fit for a more contemporary and cosmopolitan urban resident. Supporters of the plan spoke at length about the archaic, crumbling, inefficient city that now encircles Wrigley Field, voicing complaints about inadequate access, the lack of decent concessions other than hot dogs, and the dozens of unsightly neighborhoods obstructing the view of the adored baseball stadium. 'That whole Chicago area around Wrigley is decrepit and, if we're being honest, just plain ugly. Frankly, I just don't understand why we should hang on to the past,' said Cubs season ticket holder Mark Barger. 'I've never been a big fan of the skyline. We should get rid of it and put up some sleek, contemporary buildings that aren't so gaudy, something that doesn't look like it was built in a hurry in the late 1970s.' 'Also, they should remove that tacky water feature,' added Barger, indicating the Chicago River. 'It's right in the way of everything and old and gross and nobody even uses it.' The majority of fans lobbying for the demolition of the third-most populous city in the United States also objected to the fact that Chicago lacks a retractable dome that could be closed on days with bad weather. Others criticized the area outside of Wrigley Field for being too cramped and deficient in decent seating, pointing out that, during the winter months and while the Cubs were on road swings, the city went largely unused anyway. Although Wrigley Field adherents acknowledged that tearing down the city of Chicago would be a colossal endeavor, the dedicated Cubs fans recommended accomplishing the task in small increments, starting with imploding U.S. Cellular Field and then bulldozing what remains of the South Side. 'I know how this will sound to people who don't live here, but Chicago is totally cursed,' said Cubs fan Paul Griffin, who suggested the Cubs demand a new city as lovable as their legacy. 'We shouldn't be afraid to knock this whole place down and start over. Nothing has happened in the place for over a century.' 'Chicago will always be known as the place where dreams go to die. It's time to demolish it and get a brand new metropolis,' added Griffin. The optimistic Cubs fans informed city aldermen that destroying everything surrounding Wrigley Field would rally the local economy by creating millions of jobs to first tear down Chicago and then to rebuild the new, far better city. In addition, the plan suggested that finding a corporate sponsor to buy the naming rights could offset the costs of constructing and running Chicago's replacement. The plan to tear down Chicago, sources confirmed, was surprisingly popular with people from other cities in the region. 'I hate that fucking thing,' said Milwaukee resident Tim Rach. 'It's such a shithole. It's expensive, the beer sucks, the food is overrated, and they're total assholes to visitors.' ",0
"Fleeing BabylonHolly Deyo, Contributor Whew! People cry out for direction Where can I go? Where should I move? What country is safe? Tell me! TELL ME! I should have written this article four years ago, but people would not have listened. Now it is nearly too late. Increasingly people feel the answer is to flee our country, move somewhere else, move anywhere else. Before you embark on this likely one-way journey, let me share with you what it might be like. In the last 12 months, Ive read numerous accounts of people suggesting to those who have the means to move to Central America, Canada, Australia, Costa Rica, New Zealand, Mexico, anywhere besides here. Even before that when people had heard wed lived in Oz many years, inevitably comments poured in, Ive always wanted to go to Australia! Living in a foreign country is vastly different than merely visiting it for even 6 months. As a tourist youll be treated like royalty as its your pockets contents they want, not your presence. My husband moved to Australia to pursue his advanced propulsion research in 1971. At that time, Australia welcomed him like a chick to its nest. Many of his closest friends are still those who live Downunder and three of our children and their families live there. But these are people that it takes years to bond with, to be accepted by. Australia is a unique and beautiful country, but not without built-in problems. Let me say at this point, that it is not my intention to offend any Australian or any person living in another country. If they moved to America, they might feel the same way I did living elsewhere. To this day, Stan and I have dear friends In Australia with whom we still write and Skype. Six months ago Stan lost his oldest Aussie friend Charlie Parker. Chas built the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria from the ground up. He befriended Stan when he first set foot in The Lucky Country helping him beyond measure, and they remained friends for over 40 years until his death in November. You dont ever find better friends than he and his wife, Val. They were our Aussie family and there are others, too, that well let go unnamed. So Im not picking on Australians. Its just the experience Im compelled to share because people are looking for answers. It was 30 years later, nearly to the day, when Stan came home to America. In the intervening time, I had lived in Australia 5-1/2 long years and feel qualified to give an eagle-eye assessment of residing in a foreign country having given it a fair go. It is nearly impossible for people to adequately explain what its like to live abroad without having done so. Yet many pundits pontificate on this subject while sitting cozily in their American bugout quarters. Getting out of Dodge When most of it arrived through customs several months later, every single piece of clothing had been removed from countless boxes and shoved back inside in massive colored wads of tangled, wrinkled fabric. Some of my most treasured items things that would have meant nothing to anyone else were magically lost. Most surprising was to find that the Cuisinart had been used sometime between Denver and Perth and put back into the packing dirty and oily. Little Things That Werent So Small After the first glow of romancing a new country wore off, innumerable changes surfaced. I had to learn to drive on the wrong side of the road. It meant a new drivers license and a new test. Everything was measured in metric from distances to recipes to weight. Road differences like irritating roundabouts had to be negotiated, but driving-wise, most frustrating was traveling to a specific destination. In America where even numbers are on one side of the street and odd ones on the other, often there was no logic to addresses. It was random chaos. On many occasions, once you crossed an intersection, the street you were driving on vanished and it became a whole other road. Oopsies. Sorry, the change wasnt on the map! For people new to the area, it was like driving in a time warp. I used to be a pretty decent cook, took gourmet classes occasionally in Kansas City and knew my way around the kitchen with fair ease. However, it was like someone had sucked my brain out between leaving Denver and arriving in Perth. Shopping was culture shock! Many ingredients that were common in the States were non-existent Downunder, and when you could find them, the prices might rival those for your first born. Other problems encountered were equivalent conversions. In the States, a can might consist of 14 oz., but there it could be 300 grams, which when you convert it, is only 10-1/2 oz. This difference certainly mucks up recipes. Its these seemingly small irritations that are a big part of why female immigrants to Oz generally only last two years. And this time frame is for one of the countries most like America. That two-year statistic is according to Australias Dept. Immigration and Citizenship, not something scraped off the bottom of my shoe. Now think what that transition would be like to a country where you dont even speak the language. Imagine trading every single thing you know, every piece of history you identify with, every single store youre used to shopping, every landmark you associate with your culture, every street familiar to you, every joke and bit of humor you get, every idiom thats a part of your language, every holiday that is your tradition, every convenience you take for granted. Weigh all that and more, it carves a big hole out of your heart. I remember seeing programs on Aussie TV that originated in America. It was so good when they panned the city and one got to glimpse a slice of home, even if for a few seconds. Though those seconds brought more waves of wretched homesickness, it was wonderful to see America again. Details, and more Details The most screamingly hilarious, ridiculous stroke of insanity came with the mandatory immigration papers. Because I arrived in Australia unmarried, it was assumed I had moved Downunder to improve my living standards. Improve my living conditions? Are you kidding? To be fair, Australia gets a lot of Asian, Indian and Indonesian immigrants, and in those cases, yes, most likely they would be moving to better conditions. Second point of fairness, when we lived in Perth, it was closest to living in the States since many U.S. service people are stationed in Fremantle, which is just south of there. Generally people in Western Australia get Americans, and we met some absolutely delightful folks. That said, Perth is a big city and if your purpose is to get out of the line of fire, like here, you dont want to be in heavily populated areas. In the ensuing four years, a stack of paperwork literally 2 thick had to be completed for the Australian government. Every 6 months I had to exit the country for 6 weeks at a time to not overstay the visa. That became very expensive for the two of us. I also had to prove that my personal funds were sufficient to show that I was an asset and would not be a burden on their welfare system. Background checks were run on me both in Colorado and in Perth by their police departments to make sure I wasnt some bolting criminal. Oh yes, I had to pay for these too. Open Wide Essays of why I wanted to move to Australia had to be completed and submitted, along with birth certificate, social security number, personal history, and a ton of other data that clogs the memory banks. Over the course of the 4 years approval time, four recommendations from Australian friends had to be submitted attesting to my good character. This is what its like when you play by the rules just for residency, never mind citizenship. That said, U.S. citizenship was one thing I would never, not ever, have relinquished. Four long years later, nearly to the day, approval to stay in Australia was granted. However, by that time, homesickness for America had reached astronomical, unbearable heights and Stan and I considered moving home. Thank you God. Thank you God. THANK YOU GOD and praise YOU! But it would be another year and a half before it came to pass. During these 5-1/2 years, because I retained my U.S. citizenship, we paid dual income tax on the same money, which was very expensive. This made Stan extra happy since he had to do paperwork for this exercise every 6 months one return for America and one for Australia. It was like enduring male PMS every 180 days that lasted two weeks at a crack. Back to the 1800s Before moving to Australia for two decades I had run a small, very profitable business. Hired, fired, trained, interviewed prospective personnel, did the payroll, quarterly returns, etc. I was used to handling everything and anything, and making all decisions. Imagine the surprise to find that Downunder many women are still viewed as having no minds except for creativeness in the sack, washing laundry and prepping food. Imagine dialing the clock back two centuries . . . Didnt the days of mans knuckle-dragging disappear in the 60s? Not there. Even Stan was shocked to see the disparity in treatment. Without being a snot, I still expected to make decisions beyond what to wear that day. That was a mistake. One day, Stan and I were shopping and I whipped out a $100 bill for the clerk and the change was given to Stan. He handed it over to me and we went about our business. This happened time and again, and not just by men. Women, too, thought the fairer sex, meant you were the stupider sex. About the 10th time this occurred, the poor bugger at the other end of the line got a full ear-blast. His jaw is probably still dragging the ground, along with his knuckles. Chat Me Baby While waiting in line at Coles (its like Safeway here) I was bored spitless and attempted to engage in conversation with the woman behind me. At first try, she pretty much ignored me. On the second attempt, she looked at me like I had a third ear. Finally she gave in and you could see she thought it was pretty nice talking, but breaking the ice required a sledgehammer. Anyway, it made me smile, which remained glued on my face till reaching the checkout clerk. Clearly there was something off here. I didnt know her from a bar of soap, but asked if she was OK. She mumbled something and continued chucking groceries into the bag. This woman couldnt have been more than 19. She was frail and her hair was bedraggled and dull. Frankly, she looked hammered with tiredness. Again I asked if she was OK and she confirmed that she was just exhausted. OK, 19, healthy, why are you so tired? Despite her reticence to talk to a stranger, let alone a Yank, she said that once she finally got off work she had to go home and clean house. Then she had to make dinner for her boyfriend and his friend who also lived with them. She barely had time to study before dropping into bed and then having to get up just to do it all over again. When asked what they did all day she replied, play video games. Im sure my mouth must have hung open a full 10 seconds before recovering from shock to ask her, why do you put up with this? Then it was her turn to be shocked. Apparently it had never crossed her mind to think things could be different. She had been beaten down for so long, down seemed to be her only direction. We talked a little longer and by the time the groceries were sacked, you could see the wheels clicking around in her mind. Maybe life could be different. Stan and I arrived home in 2000 on a scouting mission for a place to live. Restaurants were alive with conversation and with people laughing. Stan looked around in surprise. Itd been so long since hed heard just normal conversation while dining out. In Australia it really wasnt the done thing. People got on with eating and little else. Its Only Polite Later when we passed through a mall door, a little old lady held it open for him. When we passed through, he turned and asked, whyd she do that? Huh? Do what? Hold the door open for me. He replied patiently. Because thats what we do here. Its just common courtesy. I cant tell you the number of times when walking through a door in Victoria and the person a hairs breath away let the door slam right in my face. It just wouldnt occur to them to do otherwise. What it does do is point out differences once again between Americans and somewhere else. Nearly Naked One way women feel at home in a new environment is through shopping. If we can just find a store we really like, it makes us acclimatize easier. However, shopping for clothes there was nearly impossible. I simply could not find jeans to fit. My body is curvy and long-legged, but most Australian women are either more straight-legged and they gain weight in their middles or they are Asian built with very short, lean legs. Either way I simply couldnt find Levis to fit and ended up importing them from Colorado. It was beyond frustrating and I didnt purchase more than two pieces of clothing the whole time in Australia. OK, these are bearable grievances if you have no alternative for where to live. One could suck it up and buck up if necessary. Trouble was, I didnt have to, and it made the longing to go home all the stronger. I just didnt fit. Youre Not in Kansas Anymore One November, really dear friends gave up a surprise Thanksgiving feast. We were touched down to our toes and Carmel had even made a traditional pumpkin pie, though Aussies normally eat pumpkin in soup. Their entire family had come to dinner from around the country all 11 kids. One of their sons was an international banker in South America. Mike was refined and sophisticated; he had a quick wit and even quicker tongue. Partway through dinner, Mike inquired whether wed read an editorial the preceding week in The Age, Melbournes lead newspaper. No we hadnt, should we have? Quietly he nodded, Yes, this bloke wrote a piece about whats wrong with Americans. He paused, then continued. Theyre over sexed, over paid and over here still. Then Mike flashed an engaging grin, but we sensed his underlying animus. Living primarily in South America, he been exposed too long to ill feelings toward Americans and it was impossible for him to disguise his own dislike. This sentiment dates back to WWII when many U.S. servicemen took their RR in The Lucky Country. By all counts, American men had more $$ and their teeth were better. We had better diets, so our men were bigger, healthier and generally better looking. Those are Mikes word, not mine. Australian women fell all over themselves thinking if they put out, the servicemen would marry them and take them back to America. Instead, it produced a rash of illegitimate babies, literally thousands of them and Americans were blamed for that, pretty much like we are for the rest of the worlds problems. Somehow, it was always conveniently overlooked that if the Australian women hadnt been so easy, they wouldnt have ended up pregnant. I looked over at Stan; he looked at me. You could have heard a leaf drop two miles away. For a moment, no one said a word. Then Carmel quipped, Would somebody please pass the peas? She must have been beyond mortified and we were embarrassed for her for Mikes brash manners. A second clue came to light about the true feelings some Australians share when Stan took our truck to the mechanic. Every time we saw Joe, he was always singing and talking about going to America. His dream was to conquer L.A. and hit it big in the music industry. We got to be friendly to the point where Stan shared with him a bad experience of being hugely overcharged by a repairman. Joe started to say something and changed his mind. When Stan prompted him, Joe finally conveyed that it was the prevailing attitude that most Americans had money. If they had money, they had screwed somebody to get it. (Believe me, that is the cleaned up version.) And if Americans had screwed people to get what they had, it made them fair game for the same. Hence the overcharging. It was just assumed about Americans and wrongly so. Through the years, Stan learned it was best to live in jeans and drive a beat up car or your wallet would take a waxing. Wow! Was that attitude a shock! Stan had started an egg business at age 13 and I had worked every day since age 15. I worked year round and all through high school and university while carrying 19 hours a semester. No one gave us anything, and both sets of our parents had instilled in the kids a strong work ethic. The Australian tall poppy attitude was disappointing. When the World Collapses So now you have a general picture of what its like on the downside of living in a foreign country during good times, a country as much like America as youll find with the possible exception of Canada. To be fair, it is much more difficult for women to adjust to living outside the U.S. than it is for men. Additionally the older people are when they move, the more difficult the transition. Weve had half a dozen acquaintances over the past few years move to Australia and New Zealand. They quit their job, sold out, and moved their entire family to a place theyd never been. Thinking to make the best of it, they dug in as had we. When I say dug in, it took us two full years to make our 10-acre farmlet self-sufficient. It was truly a beautiful property with two wells, two ponds, fully fenced acreage, steers, good neighbors, stored food, a productive garden and everything was debt-free. However, those are just things and it cant replace family, your heritage and your ties. Within two years, three tops, those people who had moved to Oceana packed it in and came home to America. Those were expensive lessons all in a fit to escape. All Hell Cuts Loose What if you are abroad when the SHTF? How will you feel when all that you loved disappears? You will, in essence, be a country orphan. It is something neither Stan nor I could contemplate. We would rather go down with the ship so to speak, than to save our buns, but have your heart ripped out. When we finally decided to come home, it was after much prayer 6 months in fact, of asking for direction. Stan has shared this dream/vision in interviews before so Ill just reference the barest outline. He was shown this exact location, where we live now, looking southwest to the mountains as seen from our basement window. Three times on the map was spelled out B E U L A H, which is the small town we see from that perspective. When he lifted his head, an invisible hand pushed his face down again to look carefully at the map. It doesnt get much clearer than that. In 2001 when we came home and for many years before that, Stan knew that America would be taken out of the picture. Then, more than a decade ago, I didnt have a firm grasp on that concept. Not really. All I could think about was coming home to Colorado. So even though Stan knew this will not end well for our Nation, he obeyed the Lord and moved us where he was shown. So chances are when things go south globally, it will be perceived as Americas fault if not in actuality. Right now you might be contemplating moving out of America or perhaps youve already done so. Maybe the natives are friendly now, but how will they treat you if you are seen as the cause of their new-found misery? You may not be directly responsible, but you will be the bulls-eye of their hatred, for deep inside you will always be American. When America goes down, the world will too, and while the entire world grieves our destruction, poo rolls downhill and attaches to all in its path. Remember Revelation 18:9-20? Where will people get the better-made goods and to whom will they sell all their stuff? Arent we the great consumers? Consider that its no one thing, but a system, a religion, and a place. Entire treatises are devoted to this subject and Mystery Babylon is not the point of this message so please dont write me on this. This was a rhetorically-posed question only. What is hoped by this author is for those thinking of moving abroad that you consider all ramifications rationally and carefully. Do not romanticize such a move. There is nothing romantic about it. It is difficult and expensive and one that will leave wounds in your heart you cant even imagine. Then pray about it. If the Lord shows you unquestionably to leave, then do so and He will take care of you. I love our country, but not its government. It has become a corrupt and contemptible machine. While this Nation resembles little of what it used to be even 25 years ago, it is still the best place and Im glad to be home. Regardless, make your preparations as quickly as possible. So many, many people feel Stan and I included time is running out on nearly every front. Getting a new place ready and fully equipped, whether within the U.S. or abroad, takes time and considerable money. The dilemma is well summed up by the 70s punk rock band, The Clash in Should I Stay or Should I Go? If I go there will be trouble, if I stay, it will be double. Whatever you decide, Godspeed.

"Los Angeles â€” After the recent murders of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., and the devastating videos of the shooting deaths of black men like Alton B. Sterling and Philando Castile, the future of police-community relations in cities all over America hangs in the balance. But even as the country is still reeling from these traumas, this is no time for despair.Since the urban unrest of the 1960s, a series of post-riot audits â€” from the McCone, Kerner and Christopher Commissions to President Obamaâ€™s Task Force on 21st-Century Policing (on which one of us serves) â€” have prescribed the same remedy for police-community conflict: move to guardian policing, overcome bias and replace the â€œspiral of despairâ€ in poor neighborhoods with opportunity and justice.We have yet to deliver on many of these â€” despite the regular reminders we get. Just this week, the report on Baltimore commissioned by the Department of Justice after the 2015 death in police custody of Freddie Gray prescribed a transformation of police culture and practice supervised by the courts, much like the â€œconsent decreeâ€ imposed on the Los Angeles Police Department in 2001. At that time, the city faced a total breakdown of public-police trust; since then, we have come a long way, but reform is still a work in progress.One of us is the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. The other is a civil rights lawyer who, for years, sued that department. Itâ€™s safe to say that the Hatfields and the McCoys shared more affection than we did. But in 2002 we joined forces with: Mayor James Hahn; a Federal District Court judge, Gary A. Feess; the chief of police at the time, William J. Bratton; and an army of reformers in an urgent quest for a police culture that no longer prompted race riots or judicial supervision.Call it guardian policing, trust policing, problem-solving policing, relationship-based policing, community policing or partnership policing. The many names share one vision: humane, compassionate, culturally fluent cops who have a mind-set of respect, do not fear black men, and serve long enough to know residentsâ€™ names, speak their languages and help improve the neighborhood.We believed this approach could reduce bad policing, bolster law enforcement and increase public safety. We went out to prove it, and 15 years later, we think we have.Come to Watts and East Los Angeles and you will see the Police Departmentâ€™s Community Safety Partnership unit, which operates in seven of the cityâ€™s most violent public housing projects. Here, officers call out residentsâ€™ names in greeting and patrol on foot with gang intervention specialists. The officers earn trust by participating in a range of neighborhood activities â€” everything from buying bifocals for older people to helping start a farmersâ€™ market and sports leagues for kids. The unitâ€™s officers are not promoted for making arrests, but for demonstrating how they diverted a kid from jail and increased trust.Above all, they do not view residents of high-crime areas as potential suspects or deportees but as partners in public safety. In white neighborhoods, they are trained to not see black men as out-of-place threats. Many other officers, of course, strive for these goals, though they often do so without the special training and extra resources of this program.But the police are only half the equation. This partnership demands changes from the community that may be even harder to deliver. In Los Angeles, grieving parents had to agree to join cops who had jailed or killed their children during the wars on drugs and gangs. The Community Safety Partnership began with an officerâ€™s apology for past police transgressions; after that, Watts and East Los Angeles leaders agreed to work with the Police Department in the pilot program.The benefits are manifest. In its first year, the partnership unit posted the departmentâ€™s steepest crime reductions and has sustained those drops ever since. For nearly two years after the start of the program, three housing projects that had once suffered several killings a year did not have a single murder. And in Watts, there have been no shootings by the partnership officers in over five years.The true test of guardian policing, however, is during a crisis. This is when the reservoir of trust saves lives â€” as it did three weeks ago, after a Los Angeles police officer killed a young man who was shooting at the police.Angry members of the community demanded an emergency meeting with the police. At the end of the painful session, a former gang leader concluded that the death was extremely sad, but â€œif you shoot at the cops, you should expect to die.â€ Other attendees handed officers rosaries, and they apologized for earlier â€œkill the copsâ€ talk after rumors that officers had fired when the young man was surrendering.In the past, there would have been no listening â€” bottles, rocks and worse would have been the only response. But by morning, calm had taken hold.The same dividend for guardian policing was evident in Dallas. Despite the worst efforts of a determined, vicious assassin, community policing efforts there yielded an outpouring of public grief for the slain officers and gratitude for their service, as well as equal heartbreak over the recent police shooting deaths of black men. Since the shootings, about 500 people have applied to join the Dallas Police Department.We have much to do before most poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles see the Police Department through a lens of trust. The Community Safety Partnership is only one unit; we need more. But it is solid evidence that this is not the last centuryâ€™s police department and that guardian policing is part of the solution to conflict between police and community. If it works for the housing projects of Los Angeles, it can work anywhere.",1
"Complaining of intense abdominal cramping and diarrhea, more than two dozen patrons at La Bergerie reportedly fell violently ill Thursday night after witnessing a marriage proposal. My wife and I got really sick, and were pretty sure it was that ring in the champagne glass that did it, said Stephen Fitzgerald, 45, who told reporters he was able to suppress his nausea only until the bride-to-be began crying and called her mother, at which point he hurried to the restroom to vomit for several minutes. I mean, it couldve also been the string quartet that came out of nowhere while the guy dropped to one knee, but theres no doubt in my mind it was something in that proposal. Honestly, Im getting a little queasy just talking about it. Fitzgerald added that hed likely never go back to La Bergerie, but if he did, hed definitely steer clear of the tables near young couples.

"The Economic Abuse Of Veterans In AmericaBrandon Smith, Contributor During Vietnam, the waters were muddied (at least in the view of millions of citizens), and many Americans did not see the fight as their own. The line between our system, and the enemies we were supposed to despise, had become progressively more foggy and disjointed. For any wise and honorable man to go out of his way to risk his life, the fight must be clearly just, otherwise, he may feel that his death will serve no purpose. No matter what era of war an American soldier happens to take part in, his desire is usually simple and honest; most seek to defend the underlying principles of freedom which have guided the soul of this country for generations. They seek a righteous cause, and transparent leadership. Unfortunately, for decades, sincere leadership by our government, from Washington D.C. down to the good-old-boy networks of county politics, has all but been erased. Not even a trace of truth permeates the bedrock of our legal or bureaucratic structure anymore. The system has become so corrupt, so leprous and putrid, that it now actually influences originally honorable men and women to do great evil just to survive and to thrive. Our administrative structure encourages and even breeds thieves, murderers, and tyrants. It is a self-perpetuating monster machine. The mistreatment of veterans is often examined with shock and dismay, primarily because the general public cannot fathom why federal, state, and local governments would work against men and women who once served their interests. However, when one understands that the establishment system views veterans as a political and social threat, a cultural base that is respected by average citizens and carries weight when exposing corruption, the abusive actions of the oligarchy make perfect sense. I could delve into the disparaging world of Veterans Hospitals and the horror stories surrounding the dime-store-style socialized medical care that men and women receive there (I could also point out that this is a perfect active example of what medical treatment would be like under Obamacare). I could write for hours about soldiers exposed to chemical and biological warfare from Vietnam to the Gulf War; soldiers who went on to suffer recurring health problems, and who were quickly swept under the rug by Washington. I could even outline the numerous instances in which the DHS, the Bush Administration, and the Obama Administration, have all attempted to categorize veterans as possible terrorists who present a danger to national security: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/16/napolitano-stands-rightwing-extremism/ While it is absolutely imperative that veterans and current serving military alike research every aspect of these issues, I would like for a moment to focus on a far less discussed crisis that looms over former military; financial subversion. Today, most people are suffering an economic loss of one kind or another, and the knee-jerk response by those in financial dire straights might be to question why they should care at all about veterans being squeezed by the system. I would point out that while the credit crisis is certain to strike the vast majority of average Americans, it has crashed like a ten-ton sack of bricks upon the heads of veterans in particular. While the U.S. Interagency Council On Homelessness did launch a program called Opening Doors in an effort to reduce veteran homelessness, claiming a 12% reduction in 2011, the official number of homeless former serving still stands at 67,000. This, unfortunately, is a misleading stat, and only counts veterans who have are considered consistently without shelter. In reality, it is estimated that 200,000 or more veterans are homeless on any given night: http://www.military.com/benefits/veteran-benefits/homeless-veterans-programs.html That is large population of people under consistent poverty (23% of overall homeless by some measures), and this is not even counting those veterans that just scrape by. Approximately 40% of these homeless veterans suffer from war related psychological disorders, including Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and are not responsible for the difficulties they face in the job market. The unemployment rate for veterans continues to be epidemic, with official numbers between 8% and 9% (and we all know how the Labor Department undercuts real unemployment statistics). For younger veterans, especially those involved in Gulf War II, unemployment has skyrocketed to 30%: http://www.businessweek.com/finance/occupy-wall-street/archives/2011/11/the_vets_job_crisis_is_worse_than_you_think.html One would think that a military background with years of training and command experience in the midst of the most chaotic environments the world has to offer would translate well in the business and working world, but the numbers say otherwise. Government programs to aid veterans are tossed to the public every year like trick-or-treat candy, but in most cases, they are only a half-hearted attempt to pay lip service to the problem, falsely reassure Americans, and place a band-aid on the gaping wound. This has become painfully apparent after the 2008 derivatives bubble implosion, which has now triggered the bankruptcy foreclosures of over ONE THIRD of all veteran households: http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/11/30/banks-targeting-military-families-for-illegal-foreclosures/ A homeowners mortgage assistance program under the U.S. government does exist, but only covers active duty military. Veterans are forgotten. The most active banks foreclosing on veterans include JP Morgan, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, and PNC. All of these institutions have been cited for using illegal and hidden fees to increase mortgage liability. This tactic has been specifically and violently applied to veterans in particular, and over 30,000 cases of possible banking fraud against veterans were exposed in 2011 alone: http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-10/politics/congress.military.mortgages_1_military-orders-active-duty-service-member-returns?_s=PM:POLITICS http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/05/veterans-bank-fees_n_996422.html Why would banks place such priority on aiming their crosshairs at veterans? There are a multitude of reasons. Most veterans have made a career out of following a chain of command and paying heed to authority figures. Often, this mindset is carried over into the civilian world, where new authority figures like lawyers, judges, bailiffs, even bank representatives, are given far too much credence and are approached with a subservient attitude. Many veterans also spend so much time within the unique legal structure of the military system that they lose familiarity with civil law, and become frustrated with its operations and complexities. Some find it impossible to adapt. To put it bluntly, corporate banks see veterans as easy targets. To make matters much worse, local bureaucracies have been more than happy to aid major banks in their criminal enterprises, and veterans have been principle victims. Instead of providing relief and aid to those in financial distress as was originally intended when the bankruptcy court apparatus was created, it has now become a network of parasites honing in on the fiscally weak and using their despair and confusion to rob them of every last possession. I have WITNESSED this first hand while examining the case of Warren Bodecker, a Montana local and WWII hero who helped to liberate over 2000 prisoners near execution from the Los Banos prison camp in the Philippines. Bodeckers 89 years of life have been filled with amazing accomplishments and a certain level of success. It is saddening that in his old age, during days in which he should be allowed some measure of peace, he has come under attack by so many despicable circumstances and people. Warrens wife, after battling cancer for a decade, had finally passed. Her body was put to rest on the family farm, but her medical bills were not. With debt and interest payments mounting, and Warren living essentially alone, the stress and fear of insolvency ruled his waking moments. He then made a terrible error; he trusted his fate and his home to the bankruptcy system. Warrens story in his own words can be found in the video interview below, conducted by the founder of Oath Keepers and Constitutional Lawyer Stewart Rhodes: I analyze and write about legal corruption on a regular basis. I have uncovered and outlined banking criminality for years. But, to watch this tyranny wrought upon an individual right in front of me, a man I know to be good hearted, a person who absolutely does not deserve it, is difficult to endure. What I found most disturbing in this case was the number of deviants who came out of the woodwork to claim their pound of flesh. The Trustee, Christy Brandon, has gone out of her way to intimidate Warren, which puzzled me until I learned that she had also appointed HERSELF lawyer for the estate. If proceedings became adversarial, under the law, she would be conveniently awarded a percentage of the bankruptcy loot. Warrens former son-in-law (whose motivations remain mysterious and suspicious) wrote secret letters to the courts accusing him of deliberately hiding gold and silver assets. Warrens own lawyer advised him little, and in some cases very poorly, pushing him to wave his homestead exemption and feeding Warren to the wolves as it were while he quietly collected his salary. The vet was surrounded by frenzied piranha. With little understanding of bankruptcy law or what was expected of him, he didnt have a chance. The system, his lawyer, and the Trustee all asserted the same lie; that if he just quietly rolled over, all would be well. He has now lost everything, including his home. He will be forced to exhume his wifes body from the land he also planned to rest on, with no conceivable future beyond homelessness and regret. The system not only failed Warren, it hunted him down and mauled him. At every level, the legal structure sought to harm him, not protect him, or to conduct fair justice. It became clear to me after speaking with Warren, even more so than before, that there is no recourse through the legal realm. It is utterly broken, and beyond all possible repair. If a veteran and WWII combat hero can be treated so egregiously, what possible chance do the rest of us have? Warren is just one example of a detrimental and sometimes organized crippling of veterans and their economic safety across America. Sometimes it is done out of mere greed, sometimes it is done out of idiocy, sometimes it is done with downright malicious intent, and sometimes its a combination of all three. In light of this, and as Warren Bodeckers situation proves, there are no solutions within the bounds of the establishment anymore. The problem, then, goes to those of us who are aware, and to those who also share a military background. It is up to the Liberty Movement to rally around veterans, and for veterans to rally around each other. The enemies they face today are much more insidious than any they ever faced on the battlefields of the past. There will be no relief or comfort unless we support each other.
