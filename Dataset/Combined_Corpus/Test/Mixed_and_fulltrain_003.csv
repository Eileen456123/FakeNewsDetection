The standard, white envelope was found by a staffer at Clintons 45th St. office in Manhattan, where mail is received, around 5:30 p.m.It was then taken to her Brooklyn headquarters. The 11th floor office at One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights was evacuated after a second staffer called 911. An NYPD spokesman declined to identify the substance, but said that tests showed it was not harmful. A total of four people were exposed to the substance but no one reported health problems. The incident just adds to an extremely intense and divisive election season. Earlier this week, GOP headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina, was firebombed when a flammable bottle of liquid was thrown through the windows. The liquid ignited the inside of the office and caused a fire to rage before it finally burned itself out. A swastika alongside the words Nazi Republicans get out of town orelse was written on a wall outside. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearmsand Explosives was working with local police to determine who was responsible. The Republican offices in Indiana were also attacked this month when vandals threw bricks through the windows.Signs for Donald Trump and Todd Young were hanging on the window at the time. Luckily, no one was injured. In Bangor, Maine, 20 cars were spray-painted outside of a Trump rally.

0,"Real Life Antarctica Sea Ice Not Cooperating With Global Warming Hoax In yet ANOTHER case of the experts were oh, so wrong, it seems that the research stations in Antarctica are in danger of being stranded due to the presence of too much sea ice. From The Guardian: Sea ice around Antarctica is currently at record levels for May, part of a trend of increasing ice around the frozen continent making it harder to resupply and refuel research stations. Rod Wooding, from the Australian Antarctic Division, said last year ships couldnt get anywhere near the Australian research site, Mawson station, requiring a years worth of supplies and fuel to be flown in by helicopter. [That] is inadequate for the long-term sustainability of the station, Wooding said. Other national programs have had similar problems, the French in particular, the Japanese also. Whoops. It seems that the forecasters didnt see this coming, because according to all the climate models all that sea ice was supposed to be gone by now, or at the very least, thinning as a number of scientific papers posited in the last year. The current theory on why there is so much sea ice in Antarctica when CLEARLY there shouldnt be per Global Warming, is that there was a change in wind patterns or something. Wouldnt be that its been colder on this planet of late, would it? Well, according to the experts theres an explanation for that, too. Tony Worby, the chief executive of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre said,Those changes of wind are driven by the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere and the increasing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The El Nino phenomenon, too, drives changes in pressure which drives changes in wind which drives changes in sea ice, he said. Oh, thats right, its an El Nio year. (Wrote about that yesterday. Is 2015 FINALLY an El Nio Year? The answer is yes.) As Matt Vespa over at Townhall put it, you mean this is a natural phenomenon???? Gee, imagine that. Theres a record amount of sea ice in an El Nio year just like the other El Nio years. More greenhouse gases have been blamed on human activity, but so far, no scientist, researcher or climate change expert has been able to pin El Nio or his sister La Nia on people. There are a number of scientists gathered in Hobart in Tasmania this week to discuss better sea ice predicting because at this point, the only way to get to the research stations is via helicopter and that is just too expensive for maintaining the global warming research facilities in Antarctica long term. Plus, the Antarctic researchers want to avoid the debacle of theAkademik Shokalskiy, the research vessel caught in a sudden freeze in December 2013. Given that the other end of the earth the Arctic circle also is seeing record ice in a less than active period of hurricanes and tornadoes, maybe the lack of cooperation from Mother Nature and the sea ice in Antarctica is trying to tell the climate change movement something that would impact us more than anything else they could do: give it up.

0,"Ridiculous Racism, Claremont College Students Refuse To Room With WHITES! For the 2016 to 2017 semesters, we now have a group of students refusing to live with white students. These kids say it is not racism. What college professors are teaching the students is the major problem with this kind of senseless mentality. It seems that Liberals have a rule, their rule is, if they say it is or isnt It is or isnt! These students claim that this is not a racist act. Have you ever heard of anything so ridiculous? Student Kar Urea (PZ 18) posted on Facebook that, non-white students in need of housing arrangements should reach out to either her or two other students with whom she plans to live in an off-campus house. The post states that POC [people of color] only will be considered for this living opportunity. I dont want to live with any white folks, Urea added. This is directed to protect POC, not white people. Dont see how this is racist at all Dalia Zada (PZ 18) expressed concerns to the anti-white discrimination. POC only? Maybe Im missing something or misunderstanding your post, but how is that not a racist thing to say?

0,"Dead People Are Labelled Inactive Voters In North Carolina As we inch towards the 2016 general elections that is assuming they happen it is incumbent on each of the 50 states to, well, purge their voter rolls of people no longer living in the state, as well as those no longer living. Despite the integrity implications, this is never much of a priority in states where a laundry list of initiatives are spending tax payer cash by handing it over to non-taxpayers, so a number of nonprofit and civic groups are reminding the states to do just that. Getting the dead off of any voter roll should be no problem, right? Just cross reference one database against another. Minor issue that True the Vote and other voter integrity projects are encountering: the states dont always have such databases and some of them, like North Carolina, are labeling dead people the same as those who have left the borders. They are called inactive. Thats pretty much an understatement. Contract out to a private company and this issue, like lack of customer service skills at the DMV, will go away. The big problem, according to the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina in a Watchdog piece, is that the number of inactive voters is growing in that state without any sort of a purge. The Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina reports that voters classified as inactive grew from 460,065 in 2007 to 739,041 this year a 62.3 percent increase. VIP calls them missing voters who election officials can no longer locate. This is worse than dead people (on the voter rolls) because you cant find them, said Jay DeLancy, executive director of VIP. The alarming recent growth in this voter category points to a more systemic problem, he said No kidding. If such voters are inactive it would be logical that they havent voted recently, so why not remove them? Logan Churchwell, spokesman for Houston-based TTV, said having more inactive voters is not unexpected in a growing state like North Carolina. Churchwell said alarm bells should go off when states fail to remove inactive voters within the eight-year window permitted by the National Voter Registration Act. As long as inactives dont stick around too long, thats OK, Churchwell told Watchdog.org. You go to war if theyre not moved off the rolls. EIGHT YEARS???? No wonder we have a voter fraud problem in the United States. Not only is there a concerted effort to force the states to accept the votes of those who cannot prove their identity at the polls, but states are leaving inactive voters on the rolls for two election cycles? And then not checking the rolls against the obituaries and death notices without prompting? In an artfully deceptive ploy, election officials name missing voters inactive. This implies they just sat out an election or two, but these people are genuinely missing and the public has been kept in the dark, DeLancy charged. Who knows, with the levels of voter apathy, inactive voters could be bloating the final tallies at the polls with no one the wiser if the total number of votes doesnt come close to the total number of people registered in any one precinct. Add that to the voter registration pushes from ACORN, Ralph Nader, the ACLU and any number of other leftist organizations and the American people are due to be misrepresented for the foreseeable future.

The answer to the first question is easy, the woman is Jessica Reger. As to why she is so happy, maybe it is because she is among friends. But that is another story. Police in the town of Hanover borough, said that they have arrested Jessica Reger, 29 on other occasions, so many in fact that they have almost gotten on a first name basis with the young mother. But this time is different. This time the Pennsylvania mother is accused of stuffing her children, ages 3 and 5, into the trunk of a red Corvette and then driving around town with a friend. Hanover Borough Police say they pulled over the two-seat sports car after dispatchers received a frantic 911 call from a person who saw someone placing two children in the Trunk of a car that matched in description. Authorities said that when the car was stopped, the mother, 29-year-old Jessica Reger, was in the passenger seat. Officers said that when they opened the trunk of the car, they found both children and in good condition. But as a result of the lack of judgement, the woman now faces two misdemeanor charges of endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person. A call seeking comment from her public defender wasnt returned Monday. But this is nothing new to Reger, who according to a string of mugshots and court records, has been arrested and charged several times in the past. Previously the charges have ranged from shoplifting, to child endangerment. Currently Reger is being held in lieu of $2,500 bail. It is unclear who has custody of the children at the current time while their mother is in jail. Reger has a rap sheet in the double digits, including previous court cases for shoplifting, disorderly conduct, driving without a license and endangering the welfare of a child, according to court records. In addition, she has also been in state prison at least once.One mugshot shows her smiling widely as she is booked at York County Prison. In addition, the 28-year-old driver of the sports car, Ilena Blackburn, has also been charged with recklessly endangering another person. No attorney information for her was available in online court documents. The Daily Mail and the Associated Press contributed to this story. 2016 R. L. Grimes "

0,"Desperate Racist Black Caucus Blames Trump For Obama Lies About His Birth, Past First of all two things must be noted. The Congressional Black Caucus is, by its very nature a racist organization. Secondly, they engage in partisan Democrat grievance politics, much of it race-based, as a means of motivating their own racist constituents who keep them and their party in power, basing their voting on the color of a candidates skin and not the content of their character. Simply put, these black racists see their candidate losing so theyre out to stir up the base. They echo the speech of Harry Reid of a day earlier in which he similarly applied many of the same untrue and unflattering labels to Donald Trump. They know their candidate is in trouble and so its time to get nasty. GK Butterfield (D-NC) starts off by calling Trump disgusting fraud for acknowledging years ago that Hussein Obama is not an American citizen, saying he had no proof of it. The fact that Obama has buried his records, used other peoples documents and presented clearly falsified verification should be sufficient, but Congress never challenged Obamas treachery so now the perpetrators are emboldened. Butterfield makes the claim that it is strictly race-based, saying, He would not have done that to a Mitt Romney, he would not have done that to a John McCain or any other white who was running for president of the United States, but he has leveled this criticism against president Obama. Of course Romney and McCain werent using falsified documents so Butterfield is correct, Trump would not have leveled those charges, although he is incorrect in asserting the reason as racism. Another racist, this one an Islamist as well, Hakeem Jeffries, labels Trump a two-bit racial arsonist who for decades has done nothing but fan the flames of bigotry and hatred. Of course thats completely untrue, there is nothing to support those claims, but Jeffries is a Democrat, they can lie at will. The greatest display of blatant racism came from the embarrassment to Congress and the state of Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, who called on every non-white subset of the population and women to join with the black bigots in fighting Donald Trump. Her racism is okay, because of her skin tone. There is no Congressional White Caucus. She says Trump has brought down this dignified place of respect in running for president, you know that they have the ultimate goodness of America in their hearts and minds. Hussein Obama has demonstrated the exact opposite to be the case and the criminal profiteer Hillary Clinton may be worse. Both want to subordinate the United States to a world government, so, aside from the fact that it came out of the septic hole on the front of Sheila Jackson Lees face, its offensive in that it is untrue. Lee continued, as if she is the queen of liars and racists, proclaiming, Today I pronounce that that place of honor remains only in one candidate, for Mr. Trump has given up his right to have any respect for running as president of the United States of America. He is now unfit. Coming from Jackson Lee, can that really be considered an insult? The Democrats are scared, theyre doing the only thing they can, engaging in desperate personal attacks. "

0,"Sen Sessions, Dunford, Carter Agree - Lurching Middle East Strategy Not Working Senator Jeff Sessions poses his observation to the witnesses, General Joseph Dunford and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, that the situation in the Middle East will take decades to correct. He says that he has come to the conclusion that theres just going to be a lot of violence for a long time. In an Armed Services Committee hearing on March 17th, Sessions said, There wont be one victory that makes us safe, advocating a grand strategy that extends beyond elections and administrations, which is bi-partisan in nature and much less subject to deviation based upon which party is in power. General Dunford couldnt agree more, saying no more than we can develop a budget year to year and expect to be successful can we develop a strategy year to year and make lurching changes and expect to be successful. Sessions asks if he assesses it to be a generational conflict of twenty years or more. Dunford replies, Senator, I think once you look at the underlying conditions that have led to violent extremism, I cant imagine addressing those in anything less than that period of time. When you look at the economic issues, the political issues, the social issues, the educational issues, those are all things that will take a long period of time and my assessment is that violent extremism in some form will exist until those conditions across the Middle East are addressed. Secretary Carter agrees with the caveat that what cant be tolerated in a generational way is ISIS, and he states that the regime is intent on accelerating their defeat. Its an acceleration from a stalled, standing stop in the slow lane, some would argue.

0,"When a Texas Mosque Set Fire Everyone Blamed Islamophobia,But Guess what the REAL Motive was We have all seen it before, liberals posing as Tea party members with racist signs at rallies to make Tea Partiers look racist. Black lives matter activists spray painting offensive language on their own property just to play the victim. The only difference in this case is, people could have been killed. In a disgusting attempt to promote islamophobia, 37 year old MuslimGary Nathaniel Moore torched his own Mosque. A Houston man has been arrested in connection with a suspected arson at a mosque on Christmas Day. A spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed that the man was arrested early Wednesday, sometime after midnight, and appeared in court 7 a.m. Wednesday. The suspect, Gary Nathaniel Moore, 37, of Houston, appeared in court at 7 a.m., spokeswoman Nicole Strong said. According to a charging instrument released by the Harris County District Clerk, Moore told investigators at the scene that he has attended the mosque for five years, coming five times per day to pray seven days per week. Moore told investgiators had been at the mosque earlier on Dec. 25 to pray, and had left at about 2 p.m. to go home. Moore told investigators he was the last person to leave the mosque and saw no smoke or other signs of fire when he left. He had returned to the scene after hearing about the fire from a friend. Using surveillance video from multiple businesses nearby, investigators were able to identify Moore, according to records. A search warrant of his home was conducted, in which investigators recovered a backpack and clothing that seemingly matched that which was seen in surveillance footage, as well as one half of a two-pack of charcoal lighter fluid bottles that seemed to match another lighter fluid bottle found inside the mosque. Bond for Moore has been set at $100,000. Who knows how make fake hate crimes have been committed in the name of Islam. The rumors were that some hateful redneck did this when in fact it was a Muslim.The Quran tells Muslims that they can lie, cheat and deceive in the name of Islam. Although disgraceful acts like this may be fine to commit under Sharia law, this is America and we arent having it. "
0,"UNREAL! Obama Spending $1.5 BILLION A Year On Hot Air! Yes, its true. In a period of American history where we are running deficits in the tens of trillions of dollars, the Obama Administration is spending money on the equivalent of hot air. $1.5 BILLION of your tax dollars on public relations and other propaganda. According to the office of the Government Accountability Office via the Cato Institute and The Washington Times, the breakdown goes something like this: Thats 667 additional staff members added to the 5,238 already working for the fed as of 2008. (The number is under 5,100 at this point, but five thousand PR flacks? Were they expecting an invasion of bad news?) Spending $1.5 billion on government PR activities is a huge waste of money. That sort of spending should be drastically scaled back, said Chris Edwards, a federal budget scholar at the Cato Institute. What costs so much is the median salary of $90,000. Washington is an expensive city in which to live and work, and that amount will not go far, but really, FIVE THOUSAND of these people? It seems that the Pentagon has the most with about 2,100. Veterans Affairs a cabinet department that really does need the PR help had about 286 propaganda professionals as of 2014. That number grew from 144 not quite eight years earlier. Other departments seeing their PR staffs grow included Homeland Security, Interior and Health and Human Services. What function these people serve, exactly, is not made clear. GAO investigators said in their report that agencies may have legitimate interests in communicating with the public regarding their functions, policies and activities. The report said the National Zoos webcams, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions warnings about the Zika virus and the IRS advertising of tax credits available to taxpayers are all examples of PR activities. But Mr. Edwards, the Cato budget scholar, said the government is also paying for one-sided propaganda, including touting of federal programs that are failing. Whats needed from the federal government is not one-sided propaganda, but a more honest assessment of the costs and benefits of each program, he said. Look on the website of nearly any federal agency, and you will find glowing discussions about how programs are helping people and doing wonderful things. But there is rarely any mention of the taxpayer costs and economic damage done by these programs. What is also needed is a place for budget hawks to look for redundant and replicative services that can be consolidated or eliminated. Public relations and propaganda flacks may be a good place to look. Writers note: back in the day, the original PR people were said to need a flack jacket since they were paid to absorb bad press. Hence the name PR Flack. "
0,"The Truth Will Be Revealed On Multiple Fronts, A Serious Problem For Clinton Lou Dobbs has some views as we enter the final stretch of the presidential campaign, with roughly two months remaining until the election, early voting that begins as soon as September 23rd puts decision time even closer for some. Dobbs notes the number of events held last month by Donald Trump was triple that of the sickly Democrat, 37 for Trump to 13 for the feeble pant suited granny. Dobbs says, Mrs. Clinton appears to be unable to keep up with Trumps torrid pace on the campaign trail. Trump is outworking her in every aspect of this campaign. He did the same thing in the primary. He outworked every one of those candidates. Mr. Dobbs observes, Hillary is no longer ignoring the press, you may have noticed, taking questions for a second straight day from some journalists now traveling with her on her big new plane. And they asked questions like, How was your Labor Day weekend? Wow, tough, tough stuff. And shes taking those questions after 275 days of no press conferences at all and she did so, it is obvious, because shes slipping in the polls. And in the latest national poll, Dobbs reports, Trump holds a two point lead over Mrs. Clinton in what is a four-way race after all, according to CNNs ORCs poll. He points out, Clinton last month, by the way, held an eight point advantage. Its quite a reversal of fortune. And the Real Clear Politic shows Clintons lead in the polls shrinking to under 3%. I believe Trump, in the coming weeks, is poised to gain in the polls as the release of thousands of documents looms large over Clintons candidacy. Dobbs reminds us that Federal judges have ordered the release of newly-recovered Benghazi emails, all of Secretary Clintons calendars will be released now and Mrs. Clinton also ordered to provide written answers about her use of a private server in a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, doing the work of what should be government investigators. In other words, says Dobbs, Clintons efforts to run out the clock, to avoid the press altogether has simply failed her. And by Election Day voters will more far more about Hillary Clinton, the Clinton cartel and her corruption scandals than she and the Democrats thought possible just a few months ago. "
0,"PREPPER ALERT: Inside The National Strategic Stockpile Every now and then NPR puts out a piece that invokes a whole lot of Hollywood comparisons. This time, the reference is to Raiders of the Lost Ark (I actually think the better comparison is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but the same principle applies). See, somewhere in America, we have six different GIGANTIC warehouses collectively known as the National Strategic Stockpile each of which is loaded with all sorts of stuff to get us through a biological attack. (Hopefully.) This is closer to what it looks like: According to Greg Burel, the guy in charge: If you envision, say, a Super Walmart and stick two of those side by side and take out all the drop ceiling, thats about the same kind of space that we would occupy in one of these storage locations, Burel says. A big American flag hangs from the ceiling, and shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy. We have the capability, if something bad happens, that we can intervene in a positive way, but then we dont ever want to have to do that. So its kind of a strange place, says Burel. But we would be foolish not to prepare for those events that we could predict might happen. Nell Greenfield Boyce, the writer of the piece, signed a confidentiality agreement, so there is no information on where any of these warehouses are, or exactly what is in them, although given the exchange from one official, its a good bet we are not stockpiling cobra antivenom. The inventory, started in 1999 with $50 million, now has an estimated value of $7 billion. The Stockpile was accessed after 9-11 and during the cleanup of Hurricane Katrina. Minute specifics of the contents of the warehouses is not available, but Greenfield Boyce writes of seeing row after row of ventilators, and includes a partial list of medications and vaccines that are contained in the buildings, although no specific amounts of each item. Addictive medicines, like painkillers, are locked up to avoid them disappearing. Medicines with time sensitive expiration dates are rotated on a regular basis. (The article was not specific about additional items like masks and durable equipment, but its a good bet that anytime these are used, they are replaced quickly.) All this preparation is both good and terrifying at the same time. Theres just one problem with the set-up as it is. The warehouse is fine in terms of the management of stuff in there. What gets in the warehouse and where does it go after the warehouse, and how fast does it go to people, is where we have questions, says Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. Apparently, there is no distribution system in place at this time. In addition, with the continuing changes in the intelligence landscape, the realities of what we need to be stockpiling are changing. The process goes by the clunky acronym PHEMCE and involves agencies from the Department of Defense to the Food and Drug Administration. Theyre looking to acquire or develop products that can meet the threats. A lot of under-the-hood, background work goes into identifying what the size, the scope, the special needs are, and what medical countermeasures exist or need to be made, says George Korch, senior adviser to the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services. That then drives the rest of the process for research, development, procurement, stockpiling, et cetera.. The government recently hired Gryphon Scientific to do an analysis of how well the stockpile was positioned to respond to a range of scenarios based on intelligence information. The studies that were done before have all been one-off. Theyve all been looking at a single type of attack at a time, or a single type of weapon of mass destruction, says [Rocco] Casagrande [of Gryphon]. They havent looked across all threats to make decisions about whether you should buy A versus B. Scared yet? Just remember that the Obama Administration is still in charge. "
0,"[Listen] To St. Louis Countys Prosecutor Correct The Record On Michael Brown Grand Jury Its pretty sad when the subject of a lot of vitriol and controversy from coast to coast has to call a radio station and set the record straight regarding simple, straightforward details that have been left out of a national narrative. But that is what Bob McCullough, the elected BY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, did on Friday in order to set the record straight on what is going on with the grand jury that is considering whether or not to indict Darren Wilson, officer with the Ferguson Police Department who shot an 18 year old, 300 pound black man while on duty, with any charge of any sort. Take a listen to the entire interview: These are the details that we here in St. Louis know, but are not being reported well or at all in favor of sensationalist stories on armband bans and protesters trying to shut down interstates during a monsoon: Some other details surfaced from McCullough in the interview that were new, namely that the county, the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys office have been sharing information. McCullough may have let the cat out of the bag with his follow-up to the ham sandwich analogy when he discussed presenting a self-defense element to a Grand Jury. Given the stories circulating and the video available, there is a good possibility that self-defense is on the table. What is important to understand about this from a St. Louisans perspective, is that in all of St. Louis City-County government, Bob McCullough is considered to be about the most honest man. To see him villified on a national level over THIS case is just wrong. News coverage from outside the city is now having an impact on local races in the upcoming November election due to his endorsements, and that just should not be. We in St. Louis have complained mostly to ourselves that the national reporting on this story has been abysmal. A lot of issues were blown out of proportion without knowing and understanding local history, especially on race. (Look up Kinloch, rezoning in the city per A.J. Cervantes, and Pruitt-Igoe if you dont believe me.) Armchair police commissioners had a lot to say critiquing the way police matters are done here without knowing WHY they are done that way or the history of how it came to be. People from other cities have offered unsolicited advice without knowing Missouri state law or the mentality of the people here. Even the medical examiner was questioned, and shes nationally renowned in the field. In a nutshell, all the attention given to detractors and unrest from professional agitators present in Ferguson from the very first night of looting last month is giving the world a warped view of who we in St. Louis are. In addition, as a culture, we in the United States THINK we know how legal matters work, but really we dont. A very good and honest man, our county prosecutor Bob McCullough, wants to set the record straight. It is worth hearing what he has to say. Source story from The Riverfront Times "
0,"Can Marco Rubios Oratory Skill Elevate Him In The CNN Debate? This week, 2016 presidential contender Florida Senator Marco Rubio ruffled some feathers over at Florida State University. He, uh, reverted to true American form and ribbed his alma maters rival just a bit ahead of football season. Naturally, that made headlines. Not much else of what Rubio has had to say of late has. Like the rest of the GOP field, hes one of a bunched up group that is playing what the hell behind bombastic billionaire Donald Trump. That being the case, Rubio is one of several candidates that must, somehow, someway, break through Trumps sales pitch to America and demonstrate why his is different even if he is an establishment candidate. Rubio gave us an idea of how he can do that in the first debate: Aside from Dr. BenCarson, not one person on that stage tonight has the same easy cadence and ability to string together that much in a single elevator pitch with specifics, no sign of arrogance, and no reference to his Rolodex. It is his great, and honed gift. The big question iscan he use this to his advantage. Rubio has a record and paper trial in public service thatcan and will be used against him, specifically on immigration. Has he evolved and why? That is an interesting question that will no doubt be raised. Foreign policy is definitely his big strength followed by being well able to empathize with the middleclass when itcomes to money struggles. How much of that will shine through. Rubio iscomfortable discussing economics in a way that is accessible to the people. He gives specific solutions for problems facing Americans right now. With all luck that message will be expressed. These are the questions that will be raised in this evenings debate that may well start the process of separating the wheat from thechaff when the dust settles and the voting public starts to look beyond the rhetorical fireworks and into what the actual tactics acandidate will use to achieve goals and objectives are. Rubio gives specifics where a lot of the others dont. Well see if that helps him. An interesting twist in the polling done of the 16 remainingcandidates is that when asked who would be their secondchoice, most people actually say Marco Rubio. While always being a bridesmaid is never all that much fun, thiscould be the sweet spot for Rubio as others drop out and he picks up support. To becontinued. "
0,"Paul Ryan, GOP Establishment Candidate For President 2016 - First Ad Many Americans recognize that the GOP establishment is not supporting Ted Cruz because of who he is but rather because of who he isnt. Hes not Donald Trump and for them, at this point in time, that is enough. Theyll support him to the extent that they are able to use him to deny Trump the nomination. Once they are successful in creating a contested convention, a Cruz delegate will be as hard to find in Cleveland as a Christian on Obamas Syrian refugee rosters. As the push continues, its time for the establishment to start preparing their slaves to accept the new master, the latest lesser of two evils that we are being manipulated towards and being forced into voting for. That puppet of the ruling globalists, who has already been determined, is believed by many to be Paul Ryan. Why else would a speaker of the house be running ads promoting himself in the lead up to a contested convention? There is no other reason. Hes proven himself to be a reliable and effective tool of the elites by pushing open borders and immigration as well as anti-American trade bills such as TPP. He also handed the Marxists every resource they wanted to advance their agenda under the omnibus funding. Ryans proven himself to be a puppet loyal to the globalists and disloyal to the people of this nation; their ideal candidate, another Obama. In preparing the American people for what is about to be forced upon them, they want to convince us that its actually better to submit to their dominance than it is to attempt to go it on our own. Were just not as capable as they are of selecting a candidate fit to govern or to win. Of course their credentials and track record in that regard is horrendous, but that doesnt matter. Whats important to them is that Donald Trump is defeated. So now the establishment has launched their first campaign ad for their primary within the primary. The establishment is selling us Paul Ryan, or at least theyre trying. They were able to force his speakership upon the American people through the capitulation and subversion of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Rep Jim Jordan (R-OH). Now theyre trying to build upon that success by appointing a president who will dance to their tune, continue making the deals they want and open us up to every type of exploitation imaginable. They think were schmucks and an easy mark like Congress. Theyre wrong. Heres their first offering from Mr. Reasonable the Great Unifier. They created the chaos by fighting the choice of the people tooth and nail and are now offering the solution to the animosity. Trust them, it wont hurt, just a simple surrender of our nation and the acceptance of global government is all it takes. Well like not having to make decisions and taking instructions from abroad. Ryans a despicable traitor who is completely owned by the money, whose loyalty lies with the international cartel he works for. Hes not fit to be Speaker of the House and hes certainly nobody we want for president.

0,"French Court Overturns Law Local Mayor Says He Will Not Comply A top French court on Friday overturned a controversial,temporary ban on Muslim-friendly burkini swimsuits. The Council of States ruling relatesspecifically to thesoutheastern town of Villeneuve-Loubet, but the decision is expected to set a legal precedent forthe approximately30seasidetownsthat have issued similar bans. Lawyer Patrice Spinosi, ofthe Human Rights League, told reporters in Paris that other mayors mustadhereto the ruling and women who have been fined for wearing burkinis can challenge the penalties. However, themayor of Sisco on the French Mediterranean island ofCorsica said he would not lift the ban following the ruling. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is seeking the conservative nomination for the 2017 race, said he would bring in a nationwide burkini ban if elected to his former post. Terror analysts have warned that the dispute will fuel jihadist propaganda as groups like Isis attempt to portray France and other Western countries as at war with Muslims. According to a survey by Ifpop, 64 per cent of French people are in favor of the burkini bans, while 30 per cent described themselves as indifferent and only 6 per cent of respondents were opposed. It seems as if France is the same as the United States, they do not listen to the people either. If they did they would see that the people of France are in favor of this ban by a majority. It is always a small number of people that make up the laws for everyone else. That small number of people are usually the ones that have the worst intentions too. I have said many, many times. If the people that were in France seeking safe harbor had only good intentions they would be willing to do anything they could to make those welcoming them feel safer. But that is not the case, they want everyone else to jump and cater to them. That is not the way it should be in any country that has taken in refugees. H/T Independent UK "

0,"Details Emerge On How ISIS Women Keep Each Other In Line The U.K. Daily Mail calls the hard core Islamic women of ISIS female Gestapo. After the latest release of information in their expos from the Middle East, that description could well be entirely accurate. This weeks new revelations elaborate on the tactics the women higher up the ISIS food chain use on new recruits and sex slaves: [One British woman] told of her horrifying capture by the citys ruthless all-women police unit, the Al-Khansa brigade, created to enforce IS rules. They said my eyes were visible through my veil. I was tortured. They lashed me. Now some of them punish women by biting. They give you the option between getting bitten or lashed. According to multiple compiled accounts, the Al-Khansa brigade stops buses to hold impromptu inspections. They can force everyone on a bus to get off and berate the driver if women are allowed on who are dressed inappropriately. One former member of the Al-Khansa brigade escaped to Turkey herself after her husband blew himself up, and the women of ISIS tried to force her to remarry before she was ready. She told of her recruitment and involvement. Women who have escaped the brutal ISIS regime also describe being forced into brothels and being expected to satisfy fighters returning from battle. Some say that they were forced to have sex with over 100 different fighters in a matter of weeks. There are also descriptions from women who went into the marriage mart at Raqqa and were married to one man, divorced via a mulsim cleric, and then married to another man the next week. More information has also emerged about what happens to the girls who are recruited via social media from western countries. A research fellow in Britain named Emily Dyer follows the recruitment and treatment of these girls via social media. "

0,"Obama, Do Not Even Think About Messing With The Fourth of July Alright, now Obamas done it. Him and his Environmental Protection Agency that seems to want all Americans to live in the Classical Antiquities Era whether we want to or not. [Srs. Mary Gregory and Denis forgive the gigantic grammar error.] The wackadoodles have decided to pursue draconian surface ozone levels that can only be reached by limiting some of our favorite summertime activities: grilling and setting off fireworks. From the Daily Caller: Because the proposed ozone rule is set so low, things as harmless as a few backyard chefs grilling burgers in the same area at the same time, or even festive fireworks being launched during an Independence Day celebration, could cause an area to violate federal ozone standard thresholds. Such a violation of the EPAs unreasonably low ozone limit would result in fines and other penalties for local governments from federal regulators. In an attempt to steer clear of punishment, local lawmakers will have to respond to the new EPA rules by enacting municipal grilling bans and canceling fireworks shows from sea to shining sea. Uh, yeah, no. Ixnay on the anbay. Not even. No can do, you Marxist comrades. Aint happenin. See, the municipalities out here on the fruited plain are a bit busy with the crime rate that has skyrocketed since you all stirred up the embers of the race war issue that had been slowly dying for a few decades. The cops really dont have time to be writing citations for this kind of thing. The municipalitieswhat, is the goal to fine them out of existence? Dont answer that. Backyard grilling is how a lot of us survive in the summer. Normally this summer is an exception in these parts since its a flood year one cooks on the grill mainly to keep the house from heating up with the oven. (Gotta love natural gas. Yeah, that in-ground grill is not a luxury item.) That just makes the air conditioning run more. More AC uses more electricity, which is in short supply as it is since the regime has decided we cant burn coal anymore. When it comes to fireworks, both the legal small stuff and the huge displays put on by cities from sea to shining sea, uh, yeah, see it was John Adams, second president of the United States and signer of the Declaration of Independence, who said that we would forever be lighting bonfires and illuminations on this day. The regime wants to break a 239 year old tradition for the sake of a little ozone that will naturally dissipate just like it always has? Oh, yeah, thats a brilliant idea. No more oohs and ahhs for a country that defied the odds when it sent the overlords packing and not only survived, but became the most powerful nation on earth. Thats one way to work on demoralization. The Daily Caller points out that such a move as limiting ozone would cost a lot of construction jobs and force manufacturers to find other places to make their products. Thats a sector of the economy the USA cant afford to lose. As it is, the latest ozone rule standards are unenforceable and there are still places not in compliance. And, for Heavens sake, it is so freaking unnecessary. According to the EPA itself, surface ozone has been falling on its own for thirty years and will reduce further with no changes: Americans are breathing easier than they have in decades and, if the EPA just leaves things alone, ozone levels will drop another 36 percent by 2025. There is simply no need for President Obama and the EPA to kill jobs, destroy the economy and end Independence Day as we know it for the sake of irrational and unnecessary new environmental standards. And yet the environmental stooge, Gina McCarthy gave it a shot anyway. She tried to con Congress into passing the rule. So far they havent taken her up on it. Yeah, well out here on the fruited plain, Obama regime, you can take your EPA ozone standards and shove it. Youre messing with the Fourth of July, the nations birthday. This is one of just two days that have been with Americans from the beginning where we celebrate all together. (Memorial and Labor came considerably after the 4th and Thanksgiving, even if Thanksgiving kept moving for the first 80 years or so.) Its a day of relaxation and good, old American style food and yes that includes a whole lot of dead animal flesh. (Grilling fruit? WT#? That would ruin perfectly good watermelon.) It could even mean roasting marshmallows over a bonfire and making the greatest of American camping treats smores. For many of us, its a celebration of one of the tastiest animals God put on this earth pork. (Seriously, give me bacon or give me death could be slogan in this house.) Mess with surface ozone and risk the wrath of dissident patriotic Americans who are crossing the days off the calendar until we can vote this regime into the dustbin of history. Obama, dont even try to fundamentally change the Fourth of July. The people just will not stand for it. "
0,"[Watch] Dr Jerome Corsi - Obama Motivated by Hatred of America, Planning Another 9/11, Martial Law Dr. Jerome Corsi goes down the list of evidence that points, rather than towards an incompetent boob who just happened to charm his way into the White House, to something more calculated and sinister. All of the apparent inattention to his job may well be just another component of the deception in the highly orchestrated effort to overthrow our representative government. Corsi says, I think president Obama has had a plan from his childhood when he was indoctrinated in Communist nonsense by Frank Marshall Davis; when he advanced to be in a Saul Alinsky organization, following now Cloward-Piven theory, to collapse our social welfare system in order to bring about a communist state. He says, What Obama learned was to hate America, that America is a colonialist Imperialist nation and that his job in this fundamental transformation of America was to reduce the power, the dignity. Corsi points to evidence that leads possibly to another 9/11, a plan that may be coming to fruition, which leads us to another, much worse terror attack and the imposition of martial law as a response. Corsi talks of a response of our own, one that must quickly come from patriotic Americans, in the form of pink slips to the treacherous and self-serving politicians. They have ignored their duty to their fellow citizens and to their nation and are now instead in service to this domestic threat.

What Gingrich calls the tragedy about where we are goes much further back than Obama, as far as 1979 and the Iran hostage crisis, with us refusing as a nation to tell the truth about radical Islam. He says The truth is this is a radical islamist group, they say openly if you dont convert well kill you, it turns out they mean it, no complexity. They are exactly like Hamas. Hamas says openly were going to kill every Jew. Gingrich adds, The difference is that ISIS is gaining power and theyre doing exactly what they said they would do. He maintains that For three or four administrations we havent had the courage to confront how bad this is, and its getting worse. They are in northern Lebanon, theyre in Syria and they are recruiting in Europe and the United States. ISIS sees this as a worldwide fight and we draw a line in the sand at Irbil, Gingrich asks, What does that accomplish? He says we should be arming and training the Kurds as well as the traditional tribes we know and had relationships with when we were previously in Iraq. We should be providing air power in a massive way and hunting ISIS anywhere it exists. Gingrich contends Our goal shouldnt be to stop ISIS, our goal should be to destroy ISIS.

0,"Savage - DHS Mobsters Attempting Takeover Of US Elections Savage speaks to the attempts by the Obama regime to physically occupy and control our elections in November. Savage says of Obama, He wants a special declaration to the Department of Homeland Security to take charge of the elections in the United States of America. Do you realize what hes saying? They want an absolute coup. Savage equates it to a gang takeover, saying, If Black Lives Matter took over America and did a thing like this youd say thats outrageous, they cant do that. What do you mean they cant do that, theyre doing it right in front of your eyes. The criminal gang running America has just landed 10,000 Muslim Syrians in the United States of America without a peep from a Congressional figure, says Savage. Without a peep from anyone in the media he violated the Constitution, he violated the wishes of the American people, he violated the wishes of Congress, he violated our national security. Savage compares the thug Obama to any other criminal, saying, If you dont stop them they escalate their acts. You ask any one, its like a drug. Criminal behavior is like using drugs. The more you use, the more you need. Obamas criminal behaviors are an example of a man who is seeking a greater thrill to see what he can get away with next. So he does one thing and theres no opposition so now he has to escalate his crimes against America. So he escalates it guess what, no opposition, he doesnt get a big enough thrill. He has to escalate the crimes against America. So he escalates his actions against America and theres not a peep of opposition, zero. Its unbelievable to me. Savage notes that Jihadi Jeh Johnson at DHS should have been fired multiple times, labeling as frightening the audacity with which he has the nerve to say he wants to take over the elections in America. Calling the Obama gang clever, Savage cites the tactic used to manipulate their way in, the declaration that the election system is a critical infrastructure in need of government protection. He also points out the thinly-veiled death threat against Donald Trump by Hussein Obamas mobsters in their public assertion that if there is a death of either candidate the election would be suspended. Savage describes that as basically telling us that if Trump wins theyll suspend the election because something is going to happen or theyre going to take control of the election to make sure that Trump cant win. And meanwhile at the same time this is going on theres no opposition. Congress is also corrupt and bought off by those manipulating all elections, including their own that many are now home campaigning in. They wouldnt want to disrupt their own method of maintaining their position by actually representing the people. Its safer to appear to be on the side of the voters, make empty promises and accept bribes. Weve got the race in Arizona in which John McCain defeated a well qualified patriot as evidence that the American people have no representation whatsoever. The outlaws are running loose and there is no sheriff in town. "

Clinton and Obama blamed the attack on a video even though it happened on Sept. 11th and they had prior warning of a potential attack. Teds comments resemble Fox News Channels slogan, Fair, balanced and unafraid. When Nugent watched 13 Hours, he literally threatened Hillary Clinton and Hussein Obamas life.

The post continues on, but everything after the first paragraph clearly consists of quotations from another source.Nugent later updated the post to indicate that the rest of the prose is from an unlinked New York Times article by Keith Timmerman. Many think he went to far, and liberals are calling for him to be arrested for threatening the life of their Commander and Chief. Of course, this is nothing new for Ted Nugent.

0,"Immunity Granted To Individual In Hillary Clinton Email Scandal Last year when he appeared before a Congressional committee, Bryan Pagliano, the Justice Department staffer who set up the server in the Clinton household while Hillary was Secretary of State, pleaded the fifth. It is now being reported that the Justice Department offered Pagliano immunity in exchange for information: The official said the FBI had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clintons 2008 presidential campaign before setting up the server in her New York home in 2009. As the FBI looks to wrap up its investigation in the coming months, agents are likely to want to interview Clinton and her senior aides about the decision to use a private server, how it was set up, and whether any of the participants knew they were sending classified information in emails, current and former officials said. In the larger scheme of things when it comes to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, Pagliano is believed to be a relatively small fish. Federal prosecutors and Paglianos attorney all declined to comment to the Washington Post, however, Paglianos cooperation does indicate that the ongoing investigation may well be working its way to a conclusion, convened grand jury or not. The investigation into Hillary Clintons abnormal email situation and practices while she was Secretary of State has been ongoing for almost a year with reports from numerous outlets that agents at the FBI who were outraged at the slap on the wrist former CIA Director retired four-star General David Petraeus got for storing a top secret file in his home, when Mrs. Clintons at-home server was left vulnerable to hacking from foreign governments, are livid. Current FBI director James Comey has said that he is close to the investigation, and gets daily updates. As for actual prosecution of Mrs. Clinton, that is up to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Any decision to charge someone would involve Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who told Congress when asked last month about the email inquiry: That matter is being handled by career independent law enforcement agents, FBI agents, as well as the career independent attorneys in the Department of Justice. They follow the evidence, they look at the law and theyll make a recommendation to me when the time is appropriate. She added, We will review all the facts and all the evidence and come to an independent conclusion as how to best handle it. In effect, that means that any actual prosecution of Hillary Clinton of the litany of felonies of which several prosecutors assure us all she is guilty will not happen until the investigation is completed. How long that will take is anyones guess. "
0,"Sticks Stones...But Words Can Steal 17 Years of Life The power of the words we speak has always been downplayed. Sometimes we see the impact those words have on others lives, sometimes we dont. For Susan Mellen, 59, the impact of one persons words took away 17 years of her life. Susan was convicted of the 1997 killing of a homeless man she had once dated, Richard Daly. The man had been set on fire after being bludgeoned with a hammer. Jurors found Mellen guilty on the testimony of one person alone, June Patti, who died in 2006. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole. In 2013, attorney Deirdre OConnor, head of Innocence Matters, had been investigating a different case when she found Mellens, realizing right away that the case didnt add up. June Patti testified that she heard Mellen confess to the murder. However OConnor, after a little digging, discovered Patti was notorious for giving the police bad tips. It didnt take long for OConnor to prove that Patti was a pathological liar, and that her testimony in court didnt match her initial statements about the crime. Mellens defense attorney at the time didnt object to these discrepancies. During the course of her investigation, OConnor learned that the detective who had arrested Mellen was also responsible for a 1994 case that culminated in the convictions of two men whose charges were later dismissed by the Innocence Organization. LA Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold threw out the conviction, saying, The justice system failed in this case, immediately releasing Mellen. Three gang members were later linked to Dalys murder and one was convicted of the crime. Mellens children were 7 and 9 years old when she was sent to prison. Upon her immediate release, she danced around with her 16-month-old grandson. Mellen told reporters, I always knew that one day God would bring the truth to the light. She said she cried every night she spent in prison, but didnt lose hope, writing the word freedom on the bottom of her shoes because I knew I was going to walk free one day. The Torrance, California woman voiced a surprising sentiment to reporters later that day, claiming she had no hard feelings toward those who had put her behind bars. No, no, I always forgave my enemies. Even your haters, you have to forgive them and sometimes you have to thank them because they bring you closer to God. "
0,"Clinton Cancelling Events... Is She Too Sick, Or Is No One Showing Up? Hillary Clinton cancelled her event today in Cleveland, Ohio in order to avoid another blow to her campaign like the one in Pennsylvania just one day ago. She drew in a large crowd of dozens, while the Trump campaign drew in thousands. Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) July 30, 2016 Clevelands event was not looking to be any different for the Clinton/Kaine campaign. When asked about the cancellation they stated it was due to times constraints. The event cancelled was originally billed as: Cleveland Manufacturing Event scheduled for: 12:00 p.m. EDT, Sunday, July 31 Where: APOC (A Piece of Cleveland), 1310 E 49th Street, Cleveland, OH 44114 Yesterday, in Johnstown Pennsylvania the Clinton-Kaine rally could only attract a few dozen, heavily vetted/controlled, supporters. The Clinton-Kaine campaign have kicked off their general election efforts by traveling via buses through Pennsylvania and Ohio. Some, given the history of how the Clinton campaign deliver misleading information, may speculate the Cleveland cancellations was due to lack of interest, ie. bad optics. Perhaps this is a possibility. However, theres a very solid argument to be made that Hillary Clinton is not physically healthy enough for the rigors of general election campaigning. It is entirely possible the decision to use large buses for travel is more attached to her health condition. Time will tell. If her current health conditions present a problem for her to travel just to the first two states, how could she handle being the President. This is one more thing to add to the reason why Clinton is not qualified to be running for this position. "

The flight was going from Indonesia to Singapore. It was halfway through its 2 hour flight when it lost contact with air traffic control. There were 162 people aboard the plane, including 7 crew members, 18 children, one being an1 infant. Search parties, have been scouring the areas of Borneo and the Java Sea, but bad weather conditions have hindered the search.No wreckage has been found yet. There is some speculation that the plane might be at the bottom of the Java Sea. The pilot did ask for permission to deviate from the course due to bad weather. Ministry official Djoko Murjatmodjo said the request could not be approved at that time due to traffic, there was a flight above, and five minutes later [flight QZ8501] disappeared from radar. There is speculation that the pilot did try to ascend anyway to avoid thick storm cloud, but no one is sure what happened after he asked for permission. Strong, severe storms were reported in the area during the time the pilot requested permission. The pilot of flight QZ8501has had over 20,500 flight hours with nearly 7,000 of those hours being with AirAsia. The families of the 162 passengers are anxiously waiting to hear any word about the fate of their loved ones. There was a briefing for the families with airport officials at the airport in Surapaya, Indonesia. Officials are trying to keep the media away from the families while they await news and keep them as comfortable as possible. As bad weather has hindered the search, but the weather looks like it will be good enough to continue the search today. With over 12 hours missing , officials are becoming more worried. This is the 3rd tragic loss for Asia aviation. Two other flights have been lost this year, flights MH307 and MH17. MH307 has never been recovered and MH17 was shot down over Ukraine with no survivors. There is no link between the 3 flight tragedies. "

Theres more to being a woman than long hair, a unisex name, heels and a pantsuit and presumably more to a transition. As long as its obvious or even suspected that he might be a man can he really claim to have transitioned? Hes cross dressing, role-playing or something along those lines, okay, more power to you buddy. Its your right and your life. But dont expect others to share your fantasy or even to give a darn.

The nature of the crime that Kirk-Robinson is accusing former Bolton mayor Guy Harkin of committing is that of misgendering, him repeatedly, something he describes as a personal attack. Failing to share in his delusion is not an attack, it is an observance of the reality of the situation. He could play along if he so chose to, but how can he be legally required to deny the truth? Apparently he can in jolly old England, as the Manchester Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime. This world truly is upside down and perversion is the new normal. All of the Looney Tunes in power that are accusing Harkin of the horrific crime of misgendering should have the sense to realize that had he addressed the man Kirk-Robinson as a female, he would have then been misgendering and that Robinson is actually misgendering himself. In keeping with what is the typical response of the left to being called on their lunacy and hypocritical projections, the sexually confused man went on offense, taking the position that he is the normal one and those clinging to reality are defective transphobic for opting not to join him in his fantasy. Robinson tweeted I cant say Im surprised at his behavior but I had hoped that Boltons leading political group wasnt transphobic. He also tweeted, I will be calling on Bolton Labor Group to denounce his behavior. Bolton does not welcome transphobia. Harkin isnt exhibiting a phobia, hes not afraid of the trans-dude aside from the potential legal consequences. How about a new label, something like trans dont give a crap or trans just shut the hell up to describe their unwillingness to pretend hes something he isnt and that hes nothing more thanan annoying and desperate little man seeking attention in any way possible. Robinson posted a video blog saying, If Im truthful, it hurt a lot. The guy had no reasons to ever suggest that I was male, he has never met me as a male. I transitioned over 10 years ago and I have lived in Bolton for seven, going on eight years, he never met me before I transitioned. If Robinson really wants to be truthful, hell have to admit hes the one denying reality, not the ex-mayor. As for Harkin having no reasons to ever suggest that Robinson was male, the reasons are everywhere. Pick up a mirror, Mr. Robinson. And the fact that you started pretending to be a woman before he met you is meaningless. Go ahead, look in the mirror. The motivation behind Robinsons attack on Harkin becomes clear when you realize he prides himself as A campaigner for gay and transgender rights, and a hate crime ambassador who is part of a local police-council partnership. Hes looking for an issue and a little notoriety, pressing his cause of forcing people to submit to his declarations of falsehoods as truth. Its about licensing himself to control the actions of others, a manifestation of the typical liberal lefts power addiction. Kirk-Robinson admitted he has gotten the police involved, saying, The incident has been referred to Greater Manchester Police, and therefore is now out of my hands. As a hate crime ambassador, I always urge people to report hate crime when it occurs and I will continue to do so. In other words, dont mess with him. Avoid a problem and give him whatever he wants; hes going to start demanding special favors. Harkin, 69, insists that the use of the wrong correct pronoun to reference Robinson was accidental and not intended as an attack. He said, I was utterly unaware of this slip of the tongue until it was pointed out to me the day after the meeting. I offered immediately to apologize as there is not a homophobic or any kind of phobic bone in my body. Its not about you, Mr. Harkin, its about power; youre just a tool the leftist is using to get what he wants. "
0,"[Watch] Reid Wrong on Border Security - Bin Laden Just Crossed it Several Times, No One Said a Word Filmmaker James OKeefe, who almost single-handedly brought about the demise of Obamas election fraud group ACORN, is back at it, focusing attention on the sad state of what is being peddled to the American people as border security. His latest video, released on Monday shows we have no security, we barely have a distinguishable border, and that anyone who is able to walk can come and go as they please. OKeefe proved his point by donning Arab garb and an Osama bin Laden mask and crossing the border in broad daylight, with no effort to conceal himself, four times. He crossed into Mexico and back into the U.S. twice, once as himself and once as bin Laden, with no enforcement or security personnel challenging him, stopping or even visible within the area. This is the Secure Border that Harry Reid assured us we have. More correctly, this is the wide open border that the American people are being blatantly lied to by Harry Reid, Hussein Obama and others, particularly Democrats, when we are told it is secure in order to permit their human smuggling operations to continue. This wide open border is not the fault of Americas Border Patrol. They are for the large part loyal, patriotic Americans who signed on to the job to protect their nation. Their leadership in DHS, Jeh Johnson, Obama and others, dont share their same loyalties. Maybe this video will have a similar impact as the ACORN one and shock some sense into the sleeping American public. Its gone on too long already and we have an enemy living in our midst, ready to strike at a time of their choosing. Every day the border remains open brings more of our enemies to our neighborhoods.

0,"[WATCH] Steve Hayes: Hillary Clintons Email Was Born Classified (Drip Drip Drip) Now that the media types have had a chance to scrutinize the latest batch of Hillary Clintons email while she was Secretary of State and they seem to be concentrating on everything BUT all the redactions, yet more information is coming to light that not only did she lie when she said she didnt send anything classified through her homebrew server, but she lied like a rug, and just about everything having to do with foreign governments is classified by definition at the time of generation. My, oh, my, does this woman have a problem. She broke American law in so many ways its not even funny. Someday were going to see her frog marched to a paddy wagon in one of those lovely pumpkin hued jumpsuits, but in the meantime, watching the Obama people twist in the wind while they try to explain her actions. Oh, wait, theres a story here, even if the Mainstream Media is desperately trying to ignore it. So, anyway, Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard was kind enough to distill the whole scenario for us in a talk with Bill Hemmer. Well, isnt that special. The big debate is more on which agencies consider what classified, and the State Department isnt in synch with the rest of the gang. Please, tell me this is a government project. Will this help or hurt Hillary? It depends on whether or not the mainstream media actually reports the story or not. Thats in the short run. In the end, we are assured by Judge Andrew Napolitano and others that the team of FBI agents that are investigating this matter are apolitical and really dont care who they are stepping on as they get to the bottom of the matter. This is why so many conservatives have hopes of seeing Hillary in an orange jumpsuit someday soon. "
0,"WATCH Donald Trumps Cameo Career In Less Than Four Minutes Plain and simply, Donald Trump is a master of mass communication. That has become obvious as the 2016 presidential election season has progressed. What few appreciate is what it took for him to get there. Yes, there is natural talent involved, but over the decades, The Donald has honed that natural talent to a sharp edge. Part of that training, and something that added tremendously to his name recognition prior to throwing his hat in the presidential ring, was the number of Cameo appearances on television sit-coms and dramas and in movies over the years. Thanks to YouTube channel CH2, we now have a compilation. Lets see what we have here: Okay, so I skipped over professional wrestling. Still, though, some of the very people in the cameos where Donald Trump can be found are the celebrities who are dead set against the idea of his candidacy, and who will tell the world and any one else who will listen what a horrid man he is, and that they will be leaving the United States if he is elected. Uh-huh. For decades Donald Trump has been in the public eye and never before not even when he was mingling with anyone who is anyone in Hollywood have complaints against him been raised as they have in the last few weeks. The accusations are beyond transparent, and are wearing very thin. Donald Trump gave a face to a movement that began years ago when the American people were betrayed by our leadership, and anti-American taxes and legislation were passed by Congress. All along the way, weve been gaslighted and lied to by the mainstream media as well. We get that. The people in the swamp in Washington, D.C., do not want to admit that we know this. Now is our time to make a statement that cannot be ignored. "
0,"DC Area Professor To Catholic University: Too Many Crosses On Campus For Muslim Students To Pray It just got surreal. George Washington University Law School Professor John Banzhaf filed a human rights complaint to the D.C. Office of Human Rights against Catholic University for hindering Muslim students free exercise of their faith due to the excessive amount of Catholic imagery on the campus. It seems that this man who teaches at a different school across town thinks that Catholic Universitys adherence to the cultural aspects of Catholicism (we have a lot of artwork, Crucifixes, and statues in every nook and crany) keeps muslim students from praying the required five times a day. Banzhaf, who already has a pending lawsuit against the university over ending its policy of allowing mixed-gender dormitories andhas a history of filing civil rights suits on such topics as childhood obesity and smoking, filed the complaint alleging that Muslim students are not given their own prayer rooms. He allegesthat the university, does not provide space as other universities do for the many daily prayers Muslim students must make, forcing them instead to find temporarily empty classrooms where they are often surrounded by Catholic symbols which are incongruous to their religion, according to the Tower, Catholic Universitys student newspaper. Just as an aside from a graduate of Catholic high school, at least, did Prof. Banzhaf not see the title of the university? Did he not see the GIGANTIC church on the university property we know as the National Basilica of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception???? Oh, thats right, its named in the complaint as a place muslims are forced to pray. (We dont do that in Catholicism.) That basilica is, like, the flagship American Catholic church since its named for our national feast day even if it is NOT a cathedral, contrary to the complaint filed. (No cathedra or bishops chair is in the building. In Washington, that is in St. Matthews.) What part of Catholic isnt sinking in? Were into high art, Jesus hanging on the Cross, defending the separation of the sexes in dorms, etc. Its part and parcel of the deal when you attend Catholic school. Across the board, the 60-page complaint filed by Banzhaf has officials at Catholic University and just about every other corner scratching heads. First off, no muslim students have voiced concern for the issues of which Banzhaf writes. Second, when members of other faiths are accepted at Catholic schools, their beliefs are not scorned or maligned in any way. That violates Catholic norms of hospitality. No one is required to pray with us. Thats a private act, anyway, that Catholics are really supposed to do it more than five times a day. Non-Catholics may not be specifically accommodated at our schools, but we Catholics would not request special treatment from schools of other faiths. More or less, in this situation we are all guests in someone elses house, and manners prevail. Usually. Anyone who has a problem with pictures of popes hanging on the wall, Crucifixes, statues of Our Lady of Grace, etc., can just go find somewhere else to go to school. That the D.C. Office of Human Rights is even entertaining the complaint is cause for the big worry. The complaint is absurd, writes Thomas Peters on the website CatholicVote. Can you imagine a law professor helping Catholic students to sue a Jewish or Muslim school to demand that the schools install crosses, remove their religious symbols, and allow the Catholics to construct a chapel on theirproperty? wrote Peters.Can you imagine the argument being that Jewish and Muslims schools using their religious symbols and following their faith traditions would be described in the legal brief as offensive?! Normally I would have confidence that this lawsuit will be deemed without merit, but the way things are going these days, I just cant be sure anymore. Simply incredible. At Breitbart, John Hayward warns that if Catholic University caves and creates space for muslims to pray their required five times a day, this will not be the only concession on the horizon. He is correct in that even as the assault on religion continues, in order to maintain the true identity of faith any faith institutions of higher learning and the Church Herself will need to forgo tax exempt status. It is the only way since the Church cannot and will not change. At the same time, given that this is nowhere near the first time there have been complaints about Catholic art and culture being offensive, there may be another explanation. This attorney is really turning civil rights on its head, [Patrick Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society told Fox News]. Hes using the law for his own discrimination against the Catholic institution and essentially saying Catholic University cannot operate according to Catholic principles. A notion that has been put in practice in many walks of life. Stay tuned. Catholic sentiment is leaning more orthodox these days. Abandoning the identity is not likely to happen without a big fight. Well that was very un-enlightening. The god of the koran is the moon god allah and in no way, shape, or form is the God of Abraham, Isaac, Moses and Jesus. The god of the koran is hate, the God of the Bible is love. AMEN! As I see it, there are only two reasons a muslim would go to a Catholic university: 1) to get an education, realizing at the time that they applied, CATHOLIC would be the theme and they would have to deal with it if they chose to go there, which apparently is the case according to the article since no muslims have complained. 2) to get the opportunity to complain, cause trouble, incite a lawsuit, win concessions, deliver a defeating blow to Christianity. Lets be fair about Allah. The Muslims, Christians, and Jews all hail to the God of Abraham and Moses. Given that Abraham is Abraham and Abraham and Moses is Moses is Moses, I would say they are all claiming the same God. But in different ways, for example, Christians insist it is impossible to get Gods favor by outweighing your bad deeds with good deeds, because any bad deed condemns you to Hell, so everybody needs to find repentance in Jesus our Lord and Savior. Jesus would not have submitted to crucifixion if there was any other way to be saved. Besides our Pakistani friends taught us you read the Quran and stuff ritually pure (starting with a shower). I dont think they would worship on a potty seat. Moms friend Mrs. Khan, they met in Rockville and we went to Waldorf and they moved twenty minutes away (MD 382, maybe). I had not seen them since I was 14. I think there would be an armed rebellion against Sharia America even if it got voted in. What dothey expect? This is a Catholic University. If they are agreived about it, they should go to a university that is more in line with their beiefs. The best thing to do would be for the courts to reject this lawsuit. Plain and simple. Separation of church and State. Okay.is it me?????..WTH is a Muslim doing at a Catholic University in the first place and if these damn ppl have a problem with it..number one.go to a different school.if that doesnt work..GO BACK TO YOUR OWN DAMN COUNTRY AND STOP TRYING TO CHANGE OURS! exactly how I feel about Sharia Law You have come here and expect to institute Sharia law Dont hold your breath. Sharia law and Western Law are polar opposites. This is OUR country You want Sharia law Go back to Your OLD Country. WTF!!! Just goes to show you dont have to have more than one functioning brain cell to be a professor. I think his credentials should be inspected and whatever school he bought them from should be shut down. And the one he works at also! What a f%*ing goof, I guess it just goes to show that there really is a good reason to outlaw the so called muslim religion, they seem to be coming to this continent with the intent of over-running us. I was raised Catholic but havent been what you would call a practicing Catholic for a few decades now, but I can still respect peoples choice of faith. Muslims are about the least tolerant bunch I have ever heard of. They remind me of ambulance chasing lawyers, cause problems and sue for whatever they what this time. Muslims can pray to allah (satan) in the toilet Bottom line folks,..there are a lot of people that hate America and what it stands for. This a-hole professor being one of them..for decades and centuries, our young men and women have sacrificed everything, including their lives to protect our freedoms; speech, religion, voting, etc..he is obviously one of those people that takes advantage of those rights. As long as we give an inch, they will take the mileStarting in DC. Back to the shithole you came from, muslim inbred. "
0,"Identify Terrorist Living Next Door? Not Until They Kill Someone... After most terror attacks the ones most shocked are the friends and neighbors of the suspect. They are always shocked to find out they were living next door to a monster. Never thought that nice man could do such an act. You can never know whats going on in another mind. The hijackers of 9-11 were told not to draw attention to themselves. Their families back home had no idea of the evil being planned. The hijackers were kind to anyone they met. Their neighbors considered them kind young men. They were well dressed and well trained. If their neighbors had accused them of being terrorist those neighbors would have been accused of being racist towards Muslims. They took numerous flights to learn every detail about flight procedures as they prepared for their attack. 9-11 we were devastated, but they were not close to being satisfied. If they had trained more pilots they could have killed even more. Those hijackers were not terrorist until they took over those planes. Before that they were men minding their busines and trying to fit in.Where there is one there are many. The Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the Department of Homeland security. They know every detail of this country and the Girl Scouts could design a battle plan that would work. The president will never admit to being a Jihadist anymore than those pilots before 9-11. You dont need a confession to prove treason because his actions have already proven that. Jihad has been talked about for years and the goal of Islam is to rule the world. They dont plan on killing thousands their plan is to kill millions. I challenge anyone to read the Quran, the goal of Islam, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Their goal is Jihad and their guide is the Quran. Obama proceeds to grow bold with no respect for our laws. He continues to release our enemy in preparation for this holy war. If he was white, republican, or Christian he would be in prison. The hijackers controlled those planes with fear while Obama controls with fear based on the color of his skin.If Washington doesnt grow a pair they neednt worry about losing their jobs. They will be on the list of those who lose their life after the initial attack. I pray to be the first on that list because I wouldnt want to live knowing I was right! God bless America, and Semper Fi Shep Muslims have been gaining in numbers and territory by torturing and killing unbelievers since the 7th century until the Ottoman empire was broken up after WWI in 1924. They enslaved and raped captive women and children during their rein of terror. They tried to invade Europe many times but were pushed back by the Crusades. Unless we know history we are fooled into believing Terrorism is something new by Islam because of the terrible things the United States is doing or because Israel was made into a nation after WWII. The truth is terrorist are following the teachings of the Quran just like they did during the Ottoman empire. Moderate Muslims are just the ones that dont take Islam seriously. The radical Muslims are the ones who take it seriously because Islam is a radical belief. Islam seeks the establishment of Sharia law that calls for the submission and or death of unbelievers. Our constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Sharia law is, of its own nature, unconstitutional and can not be permitted in order to protect the very freedom of religion it seeks to destroy. The other problem with Islam is it isnt just a religion, it is also a form of government that seeks to replace other forms of governments. We sell land to foreigners, and when they grow in number on our soil, they become politically relevant Ought to be a law disallowing ANY foreigner from owning one inch of America soil. We need to ban Islam and any culture that will not tolerate anyone else. Islam is the only one I know of that refuses to live peacefully among the rest of the world. It must be banned, destroyed, eradicated form the face of the earth. We will never stop fighting them if we allow them to continue to grow and flourish. Yes, we get it, were not allowed to speak ill of Islam or criticize it. Its always about Israel. And whats that stuff about were not allowed to criticize those who control us in reference to the Jews that those like you always bring up? Think about this, why are we not allowed to point out that Islam is the ideology behind 9/11? Whyd that upset you and cause you to bring up the dancing Israelis, who were not on those planes? Why are we not allowed to question Islamic extremisms role in 9/11? Israel has attacked us. Muslim countries havent. Israel is the worlds largest parasite in history. They are bankrupting us. That is another form of attack. I dont see Israel people beheading and killing people If Palestinians controlled our media you probably would. They have a very violent history and they feel justified by cherry picking from their texts which support genocide! Yeap Radical Muslims who have said they will not rest until the wipe Israel off the map. WHEN Hispanics create Aztlan in the SW of the US if you oppose it YOU will be labeled the radical. I guess at that point you will finally figure out the Palestinians were right. I dont see Israel people beheading and killing people, However Muslims are killing hundreds , beheading people, executing hundreds of innocent civilians. So yeah we are more worried about these radical Muslims then peaceful Jews that have not attack anyone , however they have defended themselves from missiles and tunnels that where dug into there country for the purpose to attack them BY who????? Yeap Radical Muslims who have said they will not rest until the wipe Israel off the map. So you can keep trying but the facts are the facts. nice try. Israelis are the good guys. And we have for more muslims in this administration Deport the ones importing them look up Barbara Spectre. Deport all feral cultures from this country including liberals. BTW, those Israelis arrested after being seen cheering and filming the WTC collapse had box cutters. Just a coincidence, I suppose. And that moving company they worked for vanished the VERY NEXT DAY. No big deal, right? For decades the KGB operated in this Who did Pollard work for? How many ISRAELI CITIZENS do we have in our government? Why are you not concerned about this? They are more than happy to whip up this fear about Muslims. Serves their purposes. "
0,"Establishment Political Hit On Trump - Duke Lacrosse Style Charges Used False Address The dirty tricks weve been expecting are being unleashed by those who oppose Donald Trump and are willing to do anything necessary to prevent him from becoming president. Cruz has already tried delegate stealing and non-stop lies about Donald Trump, why not go for the real whopper, the kind that would give them the ammo to demand his removal or resignation. As dirty tricks go, they are some of the lowest, Duke Lacrosse style attacks. The supposed incident is alleged to involve a victim who identifies herself as Katie Johnson, who alleges to have been victimized at the age of 13 in 1994. The story is already falling apart. Roger Stone reveals the nature of the false allegations and his reasons for dismissing them out of hand. He labels it A stunning hoax being perpetrated on Donald Trump. He says, This shows the extent to which the established order and the ruling class will go to destroy the only man who is a threat to their failed system. Stone has some personal knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein, whose home was the supposed location of the misconduct, a billionaire hedge fund manager, who was intimate with Bill and Hillary Clinton. The connection of Epstein to Trump is his membership at Trumps Palm Beach golf club and a single visit to a party at Epsteins house in which he stayed briefly. At that party Trump noticed there were a lot of teenage girls about the premises and wisely decided to make an exit. Mr. Stone notes that her allegations of having met Trump at a sex party are ludicrous, aside from the fact that they never occurred, knowing Mr. Trump as a private, family man who places a high priority on personal hygiene. He also points out that the woman filed the claim on her own behalf, with no attorney, although the documents were obviously professionally prepared. He says its clearly a hoax. They also make the point that Epstein is a convicted pedophile with documented connections to the Clintons, yet this fabricated charge is what the media claims to have an interest in. On the occasion of Trump visiting the Epstein Palm Beach home, he noted to his driver that it was nice of Epstein to have let the neighborhood kids use his pool, an indication that he wasnt aware of Epsteins darker side. Once he got inside and realized there were a lot of young women, including teenagers at the party, discretion became the better part of valor; he left. Stone thoroughly investigated Epstein as part of his book research for The Clintons War on Women. As a socialite fixture and a member of his golf club, Epstein did have Trumps number. He also had Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedins numbers as well as 22 different contacts for Bill Clinton. There are indications that the mystery woman doesnt even exist, that her contact information is falsified as well and that this is all a political fabrication aimed at getting Trump to quit or damaging him in the race. Stone has his own ideas of who it could be, but rather than throw accusations in a manner similar to that he received from Ted Cruz, hes going to verify a few points before making a statement. He says he doesnt rule Ted Cruz out as being the perpetrator but wants to leave it for the time being as were investigating. In other news Stone says that he is close to the point of being able to expose the battle plan of the establishment, who are circulating an amendment to the rules and also soliciting money for an anti-Trump offensive. He says Very clearly, the Romney, Bush, Cruz alliance, the insiders, are preparing to steal the election from Donald Trump. They really dont want the will of the people to be exercised. Beyond the obvious loss of power, it appears there is some concern over the actions that will be taken against regime criminals and complicit Republicans once an honest man is returned to the White House.

0,"Kerry Full Speed Ahead As If UN Climate Deal Is Law, Not So Fast, Johnny Boy One of the tools the globalist anti-Americans within the Obama regime, Obama, Johnson and Kerry in particular, utilize as the means by which to manipulate the public is to make a declaration and then treat it as if it is written in stone. It can be and often is completely illegal or at the very least illegitimate, that doesnt slow them down in the least. That was the case with the Iran deal which required as 2/3 majority in Congress to ratify it, a constitutional requirement they simply sidestepped by changing the label on the treaty to something else. They did the same thing with the Paris COP21 climate hoax agreement and the Sustainable Development 2030 UN agreement. Its also the method that Obama utilized when he and President Xi of China deposited their signed climate agreements with the UN when Obama attended the G20. The Senate must ratify treaties for them to be valid but Obama considers himself to be above either the Constitution or his co-equal partners in the legislative branch. Knowing that Congress and the American people would not approve of his plan to destroy America by green fascism, he simply declared a new power, that of self-ratifying his own treaty. He called it an executive agreement to get it concluded and intends to simply act as if it had the power of a treaty. Thats what dictators do. Now theyve got this elaborate scheme where one day before the elections, on November 7th in Marrakech, Morocco, at the next climate summit, following the first trigger of 55 countries having supposedly ratified the climate hoax agreement, step two will kick in. That will be the ratification by nations totaling at least 55 percent of all global emissions. Obama and John Kerry are presenting their plan as being close to fruition based upon an illegitimate non-ratified American agreement. Our supposed 17.89 percent that he and his fellow globalist pirates are counting as part of the total approved is a bogus number that cannot be included in their totals and they know it. Theyre going to continue with the farce and, as usual, daring Congress to stop them. They know that a Trump victory puts them out of business but the COP21 agreement was written with a four year exit period. That applies if its legitimately ratified, which it was not but the globalists are putting up the charade that it was. Theyre pretending to be fighting the clock to get Mr. Trumps hands tied but thats a false argument. The clock hasnt started and it wont. Nobodys hands are tied, theres no such thing as self-ratifying an agreement. A treaty requires 2/3 Senate approval, period. The video below is John Kerry laying it on thick, dismissing what he knows to be the reality. Its always the way these crooks operate, they do as much as they can get away with and then incessantly come back with one additional attack after another. Kerry made these latest comments at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, claiming he was absolutely confident the climate deal will enter into force. What he is is absolutely lying, an absolutely self-serving green pirate paving the way for post regime enrichment, and absolutely treasonous fraud.

0,"UN Says WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Is Being Unlawfully Detained Related To Rape On Thursday, a United Nations panel put the kabash on extradition of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks a website that has no qualms about publishing state secrets of any country from the United Kingdoms embassy in Ecuador to Sweden to face rape charges in that country. Assange made a complaint in 2014 to the UN Panel on Arbitrary Detention claiming that officials at the UK embassy looking to extradite him to Sweden had no call to detain him even if the Brits claimed it was their duty to do so. In the early hours of February 4, the UN panel sided with Assange. He is now free to leave the embassy, however, Swedish officials still want answers from Assange, who is Australian, and are working with the Ecuadorian police to arrange for questioning. The base reason, it is believed, for Assange fighting extradition to Sweden is his fear of eventually being extradited to the United States to face charges related to online publication of US government and military secrets. According to Vice News, it is assumed that a federal grand jury has convened and a case is being put together for Assanges prosecution. He believes the allegations are a politically motivated ruse that will ultimately result in him being extradited to the United States to press charges over his activities with Wikileaks, which posts classified government documents online. Its believed there is a US Grand Jury investigation underway over the publication of US military and diplomatic documents. It is a factThe US Department of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that there is a pending prosecution,says the Wikileaks website. Ultimately, any UN panel as no control over Sweden, Ecuador, United Kingdom, or the United States, for that matter. However, the UN holds enough good will internationally to force the nations involved to at least allow Mr. Assange the freedom to move about Ecuador, where he has asylum while he is being questioned. In astatement posted on Twitter in the early hours of Thursday morning, Assange said:Should the UN announce tomorrow that I have lost my case against the United Kingdom and Sweden I shall exit the embassy at noon on Friday to accept arrest by British police as there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal. However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me. The man is in South America. With a passport and freedom to move. "
0,"Big Money Went To Valerie Jarretts Homeland In Last Year Of Obama Dictatorship After playing a clip of State Department spokesman John Kirby admitting that the $400 million ransom paid to the Iranians was contingent upon the imminent release of the four American hostages, Jake Tapper tells Senator Dianne Feinstein that a lot of people would look at that and see what transpired as being a ransom payment. Feinstein, the liberal who represents the State of California with such integrity, sets about the task of distorting the English language as she usually does. She begins by blaming the fact that there are campaigns being waged as having an impact on the meaning of the word ransom. She continues, Misconstruing what somebody says particularly if theyre a part of the administration has become an art form of this campaign. She doesnt say whose comments were misconstrued or in what manner, shes a liberal, bestowed with the liberal medias favored political class exemption. No supporting evidence for her wild claims is required. Shes trying to diminish the significance that her party leadership is mired in one lie after another, and the fact that they had to admit to this one, as well as the fact that they deviated from the no ransom policy in providing a lot of money to Valerie Jarretts home country. Feinstein says, The facts are clear. This was a negotiation over a 1979 sale. This is Iranian money that was frozen. The agreement was that the four hundred million be returned to Iran. Now, Iran was going to release hostages that we very much liked released. Would we send them the money before theyre released or after theyre released? I ask for your judgment. I know what I would do; it would be after they are released. And thats exactly what the administration did and I think its very much the right thing. No, Feinstein, the right thing would have been to have demanded their release in advance of any nuclear negotiations. The right thing would have been to penalize Iran for taking our Americans hostage back in 1979, which happens to be when the money was frozen by never returning it. The right thing would have been not to give away $150 billion more and hand Iran a permission slip for their conventional arms buildup and their nuclear program. The right thing would have been not to turn our backs on our allies and make a sweetheart deal with Valerie Jarretts homeland terrorist regime. But that isnt how our dictator operates. He rewards Islamic extremism and does whatever Valerie tells him to in order to keep her happy. And you, Mrs. Feinstein, are as dishonest and as anti-American as they are. If you think what we did was the right thing, its most certainly wrong. "
0,"Obama Conspires At UN To Push Globalism Through New Refugee Commitments Obama is once again acting dictatorially at the UN and using that organization as a convenient mechanism with which to bypass both Congress and the American people. Naturally there is no mention of the UN in the Constitution, although George Washington did warn us of the dangers of foreign entanglements in his farewell address. Obama and the other globalists believe they know more and better than our founders and are the very type of government hijackers they rightly feared would destroy our nation. The UN met on Monday and will do so again Tuesday with the goal of spreading Islamists throughout the civilized world, degrading it to a common level of mediocrity, devoid of the opportunity and freedoms that made America great. The UN is seeking commitments from member nations to accept increased numbers of refugees into their populations. According to the Daily Caller, leaders of various nations agreed on Monday to adopt the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which contains commitments to ensure that all refugee and migrant children are receiving education within a few months of arrival. It also strongly condemn[s] xenophobia against refugees and migrants and supports a global campaign to counter it. We can expect a very broad definition of xenophobia consistent with those of refugee and migrant and for the global campaign to be funded in large part by the same Americans who will be targeted as an Islamic dumping ground. Outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday, Refugees and migrants are not to be seen as a burden; they offer great potential, if only we unlock it. We must place the human rights of all refugees and migrants at the heart of our commitments. Well place the human rights of Americans at the heart of our commitments, Ban, and you and the rest of your global parasites can just shut the hell up. Why dont you and your fascist buddies just get out of America while were on the subject. Thats the kind of great potential we want to unlock. The globalists have overplayed their hands. Not every country has a subversive traitor as their leader the way America does. The president of the European Council, Donald Tush, told Ban, You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders. As a result, this will lead to the further reduction of the irregular flows to the EU. There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than 1 and a half million irregular migrants. They see the writing on the wall and it spells many different forms of exit. Hell be lucky if the EU is still in existence three years down the road as referendums in France and elsewhere to leave their authoritarian cabal are gaining in popularity. Theres something about terrorism, economic ruin and cultural degradation at the hands of demanding foreign savages that turns people off. Tusk mentioned something about working with Middle Eastern and African nation partners to resettle refugees elsewhere. That will surely reduce the crisis. As the carrot of European citizenship is taken off the table the demand for asylum will fall with it. An offer of sanctuary in Congo doesnt compare favorably with one in Germany. Obama is going to hold his own UN meeting on Tuesday, his Im so important and I can get things done Leaders Summit on Refugees. Hell seek the same things, more funding, higher acceptance levels and more free stuff and work opportunities. In essence, everything that hes already stealing from Americans to give to illegals and other foreigners he wants other nations to also provide. Obama exposed his manipulation of the system, a way around the US refugee cap, that hes pressing others to adopt as well. If a refugee gains work or training visas from a business they do not count towards the cap. Therefore, he is able to displace an American worker, bypass Congress and import an additional non-white, non-Christian, non-American all at once. It doesnt get any better than that. At a minimum Obama is pledging for the US to import 110,000 potential terrorists as part of the globalist fundamental transformation. He trying to tie the hands of Donald Trump to honoring his illegitimate commitments.Instead, on January 20th,we need to pull out of the UN completely. Mr. Trump needs to hand them eviction papers from the city of New York as a threat to national security and invalidate their diplomatic credentials. That organization is the snake den where all of the attacks on sovereign nations around the world originate. We cant stop them from plotting, but we can certainly stop them from doing it in America and we can darn sure stop paying for it.

0,"Sexual Assault Victims of Bill and Hillary Clinton Finally Speak Out! Pay Attention! Three of Bill and Hillary Clintons many victims sat down for an interview with Aaron Klein at the Watergate Hotel in Washington DC, to give the world a wake-up call about the sexual predators that are attempting to manipulate their way back into the White House. Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick know firsthand the criminality of the Clintons, having experienced rape and sexual assault by the former president. They have also been victims of the personal attacks against their character, threats and intimidation inflicted upon them by his enabler and cover person, his wife Hillary Clinton. They want everyone to know that Hillary Clinton is not an advocate for women, as Willey describes her, she is a fake feminist. They say Hillary Clinton took an adversarial approach from the beginning towards them, having never once attempted to talk to any of them. They note that had Clinton reached out and talked to them she would have found out that they were telling the truth, the true nature of what her husband had done to them. But she never did, because she didnt care to. Asked if they believe Hillary is an enabler, Broaddrick responds, Oh my goodness, theres not a better word, for any of this, especially when she threatened me personally. Willey adds, Shes implicit in everything hes done. Paula Jones adds, Shes helped him do it. Klein asks how they respond to those who dismiss their claims as Bills infidelities. Jones replies, We didnt agree to do this stuff, he pushed himself on us. Broaddrick says, This is criminal. We were not willing to the acts that he performed. We were not willing participants. These were crimes. Kathleen Willey says, Rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, I want to say this to the mainstream media, Andrea Mitchell, Jake Tapper, all of these people. These are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail. They would be in jail for a very long time. This is no longer about infidelity, indiscretions, girlfriends, sex, interns, none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a predator, and his wife, who has enabled his behavior all of these years. Paula Jones adds, And he exposed himself to me, thats a crime. Youre not supposed to expose yourself to people. They point out that Hillary has turned a blind eye to the actions of her husband over all of these years and she has been the one to help cover it up and go after them. The thought of Hillary Clinton having the military, NSA, CIA, multiple intelligence agencies at her disposal as president, the most powerful person in the world, a frightening prospect for the ladies. They say it should terrify all people. Willey warns, She will annihilate any enemy, all of her enemies, anybody whos spoken against her, across the board for I dont know how many years, she will get rid of them. She will spend her entire administration ruining people. Thats what she will do, instead of running the country. Broaddrick says, Its frightening. Ms. Jones asks, How can Americans not be frightened about this? How do they think were sitting here, all three of us, and were making this stuff up? How can they not be in fear for this woman to run our country and to sit up there and pretend she cares about anybody, much less a female? And that were scared for our lives, I mean, basically. She adds, Anything could happen, she could do anything or say anything because shes gotten away with everything. The Clintons have gotten away with everything. Nothing ever sticks to them.

Only the Obama Communications team could write a get out the vote piece and insult the very people intended to be the recipients of the message. Many people arent even aware there is an election on November 4? While it might be true, such a statement is not going to encourage the faithful to get off their government iPhones long enough to go to the polls. Then, theres that progressive phrase moving forward again, and again and again. No mention of assuring liberties and rights. Just a lot of we can give you if you help us put partners in Congress over those evil Republicans who are blocking progress. Obama is correct about one thing. Every election is about voter turnout.

0,"Advice For The Shattered Glenn Beck Following Cruz Endorsement Of Trump Glenn Beck has been betrayed by his prophet and his ticket to entourage nobility. Ted Cruz has endorsed Donald Trump. Thats how the Cheetos crumble, Glenn. Too bad about those former audience members who no longer want to listen to the ravings of a madman. Theyve surely located normal people that they find entertaining by now. All those fans wasted, never to be seen again and with nothing accomplished. Had Beck not chosen the low road hed still have them and his dignity. But he chose to join Cruz in making the race into a combination Mormon Seven Mountains Theology revival meeting with Cruz playing the role of the anointed one, the prophet promised by Joseph Smith. We were all supposed to join their new church, Cruzs father Rafael said it was destiny. Mixing religion with politics might have gotten him somewhere if Cruz had won, but he didnt. Now its just one more reason why Glenn Beck looks like a loser, unstable mental patient, the point where Hillary Clinton is headed in a couple of months. Beck posted on his Facebook page that the announcement of Cruz endorsing Trump represented a profoundly sad day for me that disappointment does not begin to describe. He added, Maybe it is time to go to the mountains for a while. Thats a great idea, he should take up rock climbing, and remember to bring a fifth of Jack Daniels with him. Theres no energy drink on earth quite like it. He then went into the ramblings of a delusion pseudo-philosopher about the idea of America being lost due to the panic of losing ones comfort and country. Hes likely talking about Southern Comfort with a Country Time Lemonade chaser. He thought it was behind the stereo speakers. Sometimes its hard to remember where you hid the bottle so the wife wouldnt find it, isnt it Glenn? He followed up his original post after reading some comments that were less than the pat on the back for a hard-fought, above board manner in which he behaved during the primaries he expected. Beck wrote: Reading Comments. Facebook has become Chicago 1968. Nothing but firebombs, Hatred and vitriol. I think it is time to put social media away when almost Every response you want to write is F$!* you. F$* you, Beck, how can you say such a thing? And those were the people who liked him. They were likely the remnants of the real Christians who dont support Donald Trump. The others, those mindless rednecks that are all throughout the South, the Evangelicals who are not listening to their God, as he called them, deplorables in the words of his new favorite candidate, probably are still listening to God. They most definitely are not listening to Beck anymore and dont care what he thinks of their positions. While Trump accepted Senator Cruzs endorsement, hes probably not interested in extending the same courtesy to Beck. Hes on the record as calling Mr. Trump a pathological narcissistic sociopath and a narcissistic psychopath whose presidency will lead to civil war or worse. He also labeled Trump supporters, the ones that were being attacked by Soros funded Black Lives Matters agitators, as brown shirts. He does have a tendency to say stupid, repugnant things. Like the time he said on air that he hated the 9/11 victims families because they were such ungrateful crybabies. That was about as low as one can get. So go ahead and feel sorry for yourself, Glenn. Have a few belts and then see how close you can get to the edge of a cliff in one of those Utah mountains or better yet, the Canadian Rockies. Ted could probably recommend some great spots. And just for the sport of it, why not try it with a blindfold on? Well be waiting to hear how it went.

0,"George Soros Jedi Mind Trick: Fear Of Jihad Breeds TerrorIt always becomes apparent that the hoi polloi groundswell is getting too close to the truth when would be Jedi Master, or in this case the Sith wannabe, decides to go public with a scolding. George Soros, the puppetmaster who doesnt even try to hide behind the curtain, in the wings, or at the top of the fly anymore, published an op-ed in United Kingdoms The Guardian taking the west to task for being trepid, to be generous about it, for not wanting hoards of muslim refugee migrants invading their countries. And that is exactly what is happening. The hysterical anti-Muslim reaction to terrorism is generating fear and resentment among Muslims living in Europe and America. The older generation reacts with fear, the younger one with resentment; the result is a breeding ground for potential terrorists. This is a mutually reinforcing, reflexive process. And, of course, we cant have this in an open society. Westerners fear and acting on that fear is what breeds terrorists, not the system of living that produces people who are willing to maim, harm, kill and terrorize humans, having no remorse for stealing other peoples belongings and using public welfare systems all while plotting to take down the local government and impose Sharia law which strips the locals of their rights, and denies them the privileges that fosters prosperity. Seriously, its like the man wants us to commit cultural suicide. (Yes, sarcasm is strong with this one.) So, according to George Soros, who exactly is the cause of this fear mongering that is upsetting all of the carefully crafted chaos of the bastardizedCloward-Piven Strategyfor social order making western life a quagmire and minefield of political correctness at the expense of the safety and security the western nations have come to expect? Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, of course. Abandoning the values and principles underlying open societies and giving in to an anti-Muslim impulse dictated by fear certainly is not the answer, though it may be difficult to resist the temptation. I experienced this personally when I watched the last Republican presidential debate; I could stop myself only by remembering that it must be irrational to follow the wishes of your enemies. But one idea shines through crystal clear: it is an egregious mistake to do what the terrorists want us to do. That is why, as 2016 gets underway, we must reaffirm our commitment to the principles of open society and resist the siren song of the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, however hard that may be. The rest of the op-ed/essay/scolding diatribe has to do with the Syrian conflict and how THAT is the root of the current disaster, not the wet noodle leadership of the west who are afraid of offending members of a quasi-religious government system that wants to render the west neutered. As for what the terrorists want, somehow is does not seem to be that they really want to be profiled, watched, put on no-fly lists, monitored, and otherwise be subjected to law enforcement surveillance let alone deported from the very countries they were sent to destroy. Thats what Trump and Cruz are discussing, not fear mongering, really. (The people are already afraid. Were looking for concrete solutions for keeping the homefront secure.) What Georgie doesnt quite appreciate when he tries to pull this Jedi mind trick stuff, is that the Ted Cruzes and the Donald Trumps of the world and many of their fans, admirers, and groupies are a lot smarter than your average Guardian reader for all of their sophisticated elegance. There are people out in the hinterland, outback, fruited plain, and various other places where the little people reside who actually DO read, do research, and do understand that one of the organizations fostering this large scale migration of refugees coming to the west armed with pretty expensive smart phones is bankrolled a few grant checks back by Soros himself. What todays op-ed demonstrates is Soros frustration that the larger faction of humans in first world countries arent buying the propaganda his machine is manufacturing. We get what you are trying to do, George. The total and complete dumbing down of the general public hasnt taken hold quite as deeply as will be necessary for as complete a takeover as the globalist, open society, one world sorts would like mainly because the regular people out there dont want an open society with a globalist one world New World Order. Our ancestors fought for and gave up a lot to have freedom FROM that. Why would we want to return to the oppression of the past? George Soros and his ilk who are trying these Jedi mind tricks have to remember that it might work on storm troopers, but didnt on the giant slug with the party barge. He had his own interest at heart. So do we who object to our safety and security being tossed out the window in favor of people coming to our shores to use our generosity against us. At this point, there is a history and a track record of such behavior beginning with 19 hijackers who used commercial airplanes to attack the United States and kill thousands of people all while trying to lay waste to the symbols of power that seem to generate resentment from the followers of Sharia. We the little people understand quite well where it is coming from, and the more we learn of Islam, and Sharia law we understand that the only way to rid ourselves of the scourge is to not allow it to take hold.

0,"URGENT: Obama Just Ordered ALL Public Schools MUST Allow Boys to Shower With Girls Obama has gone too far this time, and yes, this will affect YOUR child. The Obama administration just announced that they are orderingschools across the nation to provide transgender students with access to suitable facilities including bathrooms and locker rooms that match their chosen gender identity. The directive comes from two top Obama administration officials, Catherine E. Lhamon, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights, and Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division. Any student can now use the restroom and locker room of the gender they identify with. This means young men, who claim they are feeling like a girl, can now shower in the locker room with your daughter. The child is not required to show any type of documentation from a parent or guidance counselor, they simply just have to speak the words, I am transgender, and the teachers are powerless. The Obama administration is basically holding our schools hostage, threatening to take away Federal aid if they refuse to comply. The movewill affect ALL public schools and most colleges and universities that receive federal funds. The National Association of Secondary School Principals said it was glad that the Education Department was taking a stand on the issue. The principals most important role is to create a climate and culture in which each student feels valued, said Michael Allison, the associations president. There are countless reasons we could declare it impractical to address the needs of transgender students. None of those obstacles excuse us from doing the right thing. Are you kidding me? Lets put this inperspective, shall we? Transgender Americans make up .03% of the population. The Obama administration has just ordered the invasion of every students privacy for only .03% of Americans. Parents across the country will now have to explain to their child why their son or daughter now has to undress in front of the opposite sex.I suggest parents contact their childs school and fight against this unbelievable power grab.

On Thursday, July 7, when FBI Director James Comey appeared before a Congressional committee to explain just WHY there would be no charges recommended to be filed against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton given the laundry list of crimes he outlined at a press conference two days prior, not many people were expecting another couple bombshells: It seems that recording interviews is not regularly done by the FBI, or so a The Hill piece explains: There is a form summary of the interview, but no one at the bureau seemed to think that a case involving crimes of gross negligence when it comes to national security, possible treason, and lying to Congress and the American public warranted an exception. What do lawmakers who have the power to force a change in this policy have to say about it? I dont know about anyone else, but having given a deposition as a witness once, I was sworn in and recorded, but that was in a civil case and that is why Hillarys staff and others were deposed under oath. Those depositions were taken as part of the Judicial Watch civil case, not done by the FBI. Comey did say in his testimony before the House Oversight Committee that he was not among the agents who conducted the interview, but that he did not think the agents called Hillary evasive during the hours she talked to them. More details on the outrageous lack of prosecution to come. Remember, though: Hillary has NOT been cleared. She was just not charged with anything except in the court of public opinion, so there is no pardon, and no double jeopardy in play. She can still be charged by a subsequent administration if We the People vote in large enough numbers to keep her out of office. "
0,"VA Spying On Whistleblowers REPORT The Veterans Administration scandal erupted in 2015 with the public coming to know the backlog issues involved with veterans not being able to get timely appointments with physicians. One report even told of the number of veterans who died waiting for appointment. Now, the people who brought attention to the VA scandal are telling the world of another scandal within the scandal: they believe that the VA is diverting emails from the whistleblowers to administrators in Washington and Atlanta. The House Veterans Affairs Committee has received a complaint from an anonymous VA whistleblower who had trouble sending a work email to her personal email, after which an IT worker told her the VA was blocking certain email functions. A further investigation revealed a list of other VA employees with similar restrictions, which appears to include known VA whistleblowers from around the country. The list of names was titled Sec Divert Internal, and the anonymous whistleblower told the [Washington]Examiner that the IT worker believes emails from those workers are being sent to the VA secretarys office in Washington, D.C. Naturally, the VA denies this is the case. However, the Sec Divert Internal list includes the name of an employee, Scott Davis, who testified before Congress on incompetence at the VA and is a regular on news shows covering the VA scandal story. A screenshot provided to the Washington Examiner confirms that his emails are going to someone, somewhere, in addition to his intended recipient. Coincidence? Its a possibility, but considering not all whistleblowers are known names, and the reality that they have been threatened and NOTHING has happened in the Veterans Administration to fix the problems brought to light by the people disgusted enough to speak up, not really likely. Scott Davis claims to have had email problems for a while. So do others who have reported on abuses in the VA, which have not dissipated. The VA says that the list title has been changed, claiming that the word divert was misleading, and that they were HELPING the heroes. Davis isnt buying it. Davis said outright it was horse st. Its clear in my estimation that none of this had anything to do with helping whistleblowers, he said. I would argue it had the exact opposite intent, which is retaliating. Davis added some other news that is rather telling in this entire affair. He sends email complaints directly to VA Secretary Bob McDonald. Davis provided the Examiner with another screenshot of the delivery status of the emails. Note that they have not been read. Another screen shot proves that Davis emails are going toDebi Bevins, staff director for the office of the secretary in Washington. In the Examiner article, another whistleblower claims that employees are watched for interaction between them and members of Congress. This person claims to have been put on unpaid leave after a recent meeting. This whistleblower added that its disturbing to be on a special list of emails that appear to be going to VA headquarters in Washington, and said that seems to go directly against the VAs pledge not to harass or intimidate whistleblowers. And while the VA says its trying to help, this whistleblower said he takes no comfort in that. Should I be flattered or creeped out? this whistleblower said in an interview. Are they spying on my work email, or keeping me from reporting abuses to Secretary McDonald? These whistleblower experiences are VERY disturbing to the general population who were all hoping that with the exposure of the less than best practices at the VA, the abuses would be investigated and stopped. But no. The entrenched bureaucrats are more interested in protecting themselves and running interference with the boss than they are actually fixing the culture they perpetuate. The House of Representatives Veterans Affairs Committee is investigating the whistleblowers claims. We will see where this leads. "
0,"Ferguson Update: Rumor Mill Working Overtime In St. Louis UPDATE: New rumors at Gateway Pundit. With the rumor mill and social media outlets ginning up a whole lot of unconfirmed information in the St. Louis area, we residents of the Gateway City had a false alarm Friday night. Between the National Guard staying in hotels downtown and a whole lot of actual military-style helicopters and armored vehicles in places we just dont see them regularly, it was assumed the Darren Wilson grand jurys decision on whether or not to indict him on any charges related to the Michael Brown shooting incident was going down by the five oclock news. Plain and simply, it didnt happen. According to the St. Louis County Prosecutors office, the grand jury meets on Wednesdays and they are still hearing evidence. How much longer they will be hearing evidence is anyones guess, but the party line is that the decision is expected by mid-Novemberthats next Friday. So, a normally laid back, really calm and peaceful city that drinks too much is now on tenderhooks. (That hasnt stopped the neighborhood leaf blowers, though.) The reason being is that what is being reported and admitted by local officials is that hundreds of international trouble makers and agitators have taken up residence in the area. If the true violence was caused by the people of the metro region, we wouldnt worry so much. After a while any sort of riot is bound turn into a party or at least a discussion on who all the protesters know in common. More than one local live streamer is actually a Muslim throwing gasoline on the fire and admitting it one on a local television station and another from the comfort of his basement in one of the more affluent burbs. There have been unprovoked attacks this week, one victim was a citizen reporter at a public meeting discussing protesting tactics, and the other a lawyer who was walking downtown. The lawyer was attacked by school kids who attend a magnet school (and they were still in their uniforms), but the reporter was attacked by protesters. Both are still in local hospitals. Last weekend, thanks to someone who knew how to cut power to a large area, Ferguson itself had a blackout. The local power company called it the result of vandalism. While St. Louis is normally a sort of big city with our fair share of crime and violence, since the August 9 shooting, theres a lot more of it, and its being magnified. Mostly in the city itself, but all parts of the region are seeing an uptick in crime. The majority of us still walk around unmolested, however many of us are having flashbacks to the 1980s and the record crime that took place in the latter part of the decade. Add to that social media images and hype and documenting all of the just in case preparations, leaks from a group calling itself Anonymous that may or may not be the real Anonymous, and the rumors were bound to fly. At this point, the only thing that is really true is that the protest groups made some audacious demands of the police and it seems that the authorities are ignoring them and stockpiling the tear gas instead. The requests for donations of food and other essentials for the officers during the operation have gone out and are currently being disseminated. All of this is feeding the rumor mill. At this point, there is a lot of preparation happening in the St. Louis area. Some is visible, most is not. We are not used to preparing for rioting. Until this year, there was no such thing as rioting here. It just is not our way. For whatever reason, this town is being used as the launch site for some kind of racial violence movement with several other cities preparing for a mess as well. There are now published items detailing the tactics the agitators used in the last few months with the stated fear that they will do it again. All one has to do to understand what rumor has it may be headed our way is to read through the Ferguson Saint Louis Riot scanner and read posts and comments. In the meantime, we wait. One of the rumors that is floating through cyberspace is that the authorities are waiting for inclement weather to make the announcement in the hopes that Mother Nature can give them a hand. They better hope that the infamously fickle St. Louis weather doesnt change between the forecast and the announcement. Looks like they are down to the mentally fubar. Way to hang n there Police. I would have lost it by now. You guys are amazing. Bob Dean waiting till midweek because they will be to busy working to go out and loot? They should be waiting till the welfare checks and food stamps are mailed out then they will be to hung over to loot. WHY IN THE HELL DONT THE AUTORITIES GROW A BRAIN AND GET THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THERE? OR THEY COULD LEAVE AND LET THE PROTESTERS BURN IT DOWN, LET THEM LIVE IN FILTH. AND WHY DONT YOU ARREST AND CHARGE EVERYONE OF THESE IDIOTS PROTESTING???? SAD THAT YOU LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS CRAP. Theyll wait for mid week when everyones working and too busy to steal Racism exists against Whites. Some Black manages to string a full sentence together and he is well spoken. Im from St Louis. I live in California now, since 2013. I love St Louis. I always said St Louis would never have a Rodney king style riot. I was wrong and am shocked at the goings on there. I lived in Los Angeles during those times. It was rough. Racism exists but so does thuggery. My mom and dad were both robbed in St Louis at our convenience store in the West End. My dad died from the trauma. This is a geopolitical agenda going on. The UN wants to bring in Agenda 21. Why are the boys (he aint no boy) parents appealling to the UN for justice?

0,"[Watch] Sheriff Clarke - Eric Holder Owes American Law Enforcement an Apology Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke describes some of the comments made by politicians involved in the Ferguson incident as irresponsible and inflammatory. He points specifically to Senator Claire McCaskill, Governor Jay Nixon and Attorney General Eric Holder as key offenders. He said their comments insinuated that law enforcement officers across the United States engage in some nefarious or systematic and cultural attempts to violate peoples civil rights. Clarke continued saying, I thought that was a slap in the face to every law enforcement officer in America who puts on, he and she, that put on the badge and the uniform every day to go out and risk their lives in service to their community. He added, I think the Attorney General needs to either further explain his anecdotal references to being racially profiled as if officers across America do this thing and I think he owes every law enforcement officer in America an apology. He doesnt owe me an apology, but the men and women that I know of, that go out and serve their community, do not have that kind of maliciousness in their hearts and I thought that was a poor display in terms of leadership and adding hot sauce to this volatile situation as well.

0,"Two Marines Marching to Free Sergeant Tahmooressi Arrive At White House, Arent Invited In Many believe that Hussein Obama doesnt much care for Americas military personnel, or at a minimum doesnt sincerely appreciate their service. One reality has helped to contribute to that perception is Obamas failure to act to secure the release of Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi from a Mexican prison after making a wrong turn and ending up in the clutches of the enemy to our south. Two 63-year-old retired Marines made it their personal mission to draw attention to the plight of Sergeant Tahmooressi in a manner which would be difficult for Hussein Obama to ignore. Terry Sharpe started out alone almost three hundred miles to the south in his home of Summerfield, North Carolina. He was joined by Allen Brown in Danville, Virginia, and the two continued and completed the walk together. Though the two men had never met before, it turns out that they served together in the same Marine battalion in Viet Nam, at the same time and place. Today marked the 21st day of their march, and for the last leg they received a police escort up to the White House as well as the company of many supporters, most of them also frustrated by the lack of action to free an American service man. When they arrived at the White House, Sharpe took a moment to read aloud a letter that he penned to Hussein Obama to the throng of supporters. The letter read in part, As Marines we pledged long ago to never leave another Marine on the battlefield, and you have expressed this same sentiment as commander in chief. Our nation owes Sergeant Tahmooressi a debt of gratitude, and you have the ability to repay part of that debt by making one phone call. As the most influential leader in the free world, one call from you to President Enrique Pea Nieto could surely spare Sergeant Tahmooressi and his family any more grief, and bring him home so he can receive the help he needs to allow him to lead a full and productive life. The Marines then symbolically held their own cell phones up in the air to encourage the White House occupant to make the call. Its ironic that Hussein Obama is so proud of his phone, yet so reluctant to use it. He also often attempts to justify illegal or politically motivated actions by saying its the right thing to do, yet here when making that call is clearly the right thing, he does nothing. After the two men finished their comments another Marine led the group in prayer and they walked on a little further, to the Mexican embassy, a few blocks away. They were met out front by a Mexican press representative who promised to deliver the message to their Ambassador, an official whose self-image is so grandiose that he uses five names to identify himself. For that reason, ambassador is sufficient. The duo wont be returning home just yet, though. They plan to attend hearings being held by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding the case on October 1st. Those hearings will include input from PTSD experts as well as Sgt Tahmooressis mother Jill, Montel Williams and Rep Matt Salmon of Arizona. As usual, the White House did not comment. After all, its just the military and he, as an elite socialist community organizer, cant be bothered with the affairs of the insignificant rabble.

0,"BOOM! Armed Black Man Stopped by Police, What Happens Next Destroys Black Lives Matter Lies! The Black Lives Matter group insists that if you are black in America, you are a target for police brutality. It doesnt matter how you act or what you have done, as long as an Officer is white, you will be a victim of his or her racist ways. Well a young black man in Tucson Arizona just proved to the world that skin color has nothing to do with the way police treat a person, and the Black Lives Matter hate group is full of it. Steven Hildreth, Jr.was pulled over by theTucson Police Departmentfor a burn-out headlight. The 27-year-old author and National Guard veteran had a legal firearm holstered on his hip, and immediatly informed the police of that fact. Hildreth said he followed the officers instructions and got out of the car so they could disarm him. The officer explains for his safety and mine, he needs to disarm me for the stop. I understand, and I unlock the vehicle. I explain that Im running a 7TS ALS holster but from the angle, the second officer cant unholster it. Lead officer asks me to step out, and I do so slowly. Officer relieves me of my Glock and compliments the X300U Im running on it. He also sees my military ID and I tell him Im with the National Guard. he wrote. Lead officer points out my registration card is out of date but he knows my registration is up to date. He goes back to run my license. I know hes got me on at least two infractions. Im thinking of how to pay them. The officer came back to Hildreths car and told him,Because you were cool with us and didnt give us grief, Im just going to leave it at a verbal warning. Get that headlight fixed as soon as possible. WHAT? You mean the cops didnt slam him against the ground or but him in a chokehold? I wonder why? In his facebook post, the young man points out some serious facts that liberals and the Black Lives Matter crowd refuse to accept. Im a black man wearing a hoodie and strapped. According to certain social movements, I shouldnt be alive right now because the police are allegedly out to kill minorities. Maybejust maybethat notion is bunk. Maybe if you treat police officers with respect, they will do the same to you. Police officers are people, too. By far and large, most are good people and theyre not out to get you. Hilderth thanks the officers in the post and writes We talk so much about the bad apples who shouldnt be wearing a badge. Id like to spread the word about an example of men who earned their badges and exemplify what that badge stands for. I just want to personally thank Steven Hildreth for his service and for standing up for the men and women who put their lives on the line for our well being. Intelligent Americans know that he is speaking the truth. "
0,"Lou Dobbs - Bizarre, Futile Cruz Kasich Alliance Insults Voter Intelligence Calling it One of the most bizarre and apparently futile political maneuvers ever in this country, Lou Dobbs has some well deserved criticism for what he describes as the crazy Cruz and Kasich combination candidacy, the two candidates now one. He notes their odd conspiracy is Bringing together the refreshing elements of an establishment candidate who is a sitting governor who is running fourth in a three man race for the GOP presidential nomination but who claims hes the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton in November. Add to that another conservative candidate who, as a freshman Senator, shut down the federal government in 2013 and whose positions on amnesty and trade seem to be in frequent flux and require frequent explanation to the voters. Lou Dobbs continues, These two establishment figures have bound themselves to one another, not to win, but try to diminish Trumps results in three upcoming state primaries. Obviously, Cruz/Kasich has a low opinion of voter intelligence in those three states. Obviously believing the voters to be dumb enough to not notice the icy insincerity of the two failed candidates, Kasich will stay on the sidelines for Indianas May 3rd primary, 57 delegates at stake, and Cruz will abstain in Oregon and New Mexico, 26 and 24 delegates at stake respectively. But Cruz and Kasich cant even get their so-called alliance right, Dobbs points out. Heres Kasich sounding like one of those, well you know, playing a clip of Kasich tap dancing and back tracking on his alliance instructions to voters, telling reporters, So what, whats the big deal, that theyre just saving resources. Dobbs points out that Trump again is the candidate championing fair play, whether against the rigged GOP primary process that disenfranchises voters in a number of states or against the collusion of the establishment and two candidates against the partys front-runner. And I think we could call him the presumptive nominee. He also notes that they have given Trump exactly what he called for weeks ago, one opponent at a time. He has a quote from legendary Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight, who endorsed Donald Trump on that same day as well.

0,"WIKILEAKS BOMBSHELL: Assange Talks About Murdered DNC Staffer Life in American politics is officially getting dangerous. Moreso than even when Allen Dulles was fired as the head of the CIA, but still ran the place. On July 10, the American political establishment elected officials, hangers on and the media were stunned when a young man by the name of Seth Rich was murdered in his Washington, D.C., neighborhood in the wee hours of the morning. Seth Rich just happened to be the voter expansion data director for the Democratic National Committee. Rich was shot twice in the back in what DC police have speculated was a robbery gone badexcept he still had his cell phone, watch and wallet. (Hmm) In the succeeding days, right before the DNC Convention in the not so aptly named City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Julian Assanges Wikileaks released a whole lot of DNC emails that proved the Democrats submarined Bernie Sanders candidacy, were in cahoots with all sorts of mainstream media types, and basically forced out Debbie Wasserman-Schultz as chairman/woman/person. On Tuesday August 9, the plot thickened. Wikileaks is offering a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of Seth Rich. The journalist organization, which specializesin releasing classified or secret information, offered a $20,000 reward Tuesdayto anyone with information on the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. His murder is the subject of multiple conspiracy theories, including one which allegeshis death was retribution from the DNC for helping Wikileaks obtain party emails showing evidence of favoritism during the Democratic primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. WikiLeaks has decided to issue a [$20,000]reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, read a tweet from the organization. The announcement was made via Twitter and once again opened the lines for conspiracy theorists and the Clinton Body Count to question if Rich indeed was the leak. (One of the Clinton Body Count sources speculates that Rich was on his way to talk to the FBI when he was murdered.) If that wasnt enough, on Tuesday, Julian Assange himself, the founder of Wikileaks appeared on Dutch television hmming and hawing around the question of Rich being the leak. Watch: As uncomfortable as this video is, it should give all Americans pause. Wikileaks sources take tremendous risks to get information out to the public. We know that. Seth Rich was obviously murdered for some reason other than robbery. Assange all but says Seth Rich was a source, and he died for it. Wikileaks had to get those emails from someplace. This could very well be the case. "

0,"Obama Administration Regulations On Fireworks Completely Insane Its that time of year. Time for the kids both young and old to head to the fireworks stand just across the county line and load up on sparklers, snakes, bottle rockets, Roman candles, poppers, and all the other neato cool pyrotechnic paraphernalia that makes the modern Fourth of July the Fourth of July. This week, the executive director of the American Pyrotechnic Association, Julie Heckman, sat down with Politico to talk about what it takes to stockpile the close to $1 billion industry ahead of the Fourth of July. When asked about the Obama Administrations approach to regulation, she said: Ive been working with the industry for a very long time, 26 years. I have never seen as many rulemaking initiatives as I have with this administration. It has just been completely insane. You know, Im not saying its necessary, but it would be really great when take a tiny industry like fireworks, and weve got to comply with ATF, CPSC, EPA, OSHA, multiple divisions of the Department of Transportation, its really challenging. It would be great if we could have one agency that took care of everything, and Im sure there are other industries that are also feeling that pain, but it has been very significant. Heckman listed specific challenges as things like a constant revolving door of agents working for the various government departments which require a whole new getting to know you time period in order to educate the new person on the industrys concerns, and limits on times truck drivers could be on the road. She also discussed the extensive testing done on legal fireworks sold to the public. The industry has been very committed to working with the foreign manufacturers over in China. In fact, through the APA, another organization was created, the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory, which is a third-party certification organization. They actually test the product in China to make certain that not only does it meet the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations, it exceeds them, because AFSL standards go a step beyond what the federal government mandates. And you know, the product has improved significantly, so were very proud of that. Like the amusement park industry, it sounds like the fireworks people do their own due diligence when it comes to safety. On roller-coasters, the motto is its no fun if people get hurt, and most injuries happen when riders get out of the safety restraints after the ride has started. In fireworks, the same standard applies which is why Heckman stresses the difference between legal and illegal products. Last year, 11 people were killed and more than 10,000 people injured in fireworks-related accidents,according to a Consumer Products Safety Commission report. Most of the injuries were burns due to malfunction or misuse. Three of the deaths were bystanders who died in fires or from smoke inhalation. , said many fireworks injuries are due to illegal fireworks, which lack quality control and can produce powerful explosions. When you read articles that people lost their hand, that was an illegal firecracker,Heckmansaid. A legal one has 50miligramsof explosives, which is enough to sting but not enough to blow your digits off. To Politico on this topic, Heckman said, We look at the consumption, the overall usage of backyard consumer fireworks has increased significantly during the past decade, and when you look at the use of fireworks and compare then the number of injuries, actually, the injury rate has declined. Im not aware of one other consumer product on the market today where the usage has risen so dramatically, yet the injuries have gone down. And yet the Obama Administration has the industry dealing with at least five government agencies, each charged with regulating a different aspect of life in the United States. Just like multiple other industries, fireworks manufacturers and wholesalers are being regulated out the ying-yang. Unlike the others, pyrotechnics are not a large enough industry to be much of an influence in getting all the rule making to stop. At this time, fireworks are legal in 47 of the 50 states mostly thanks to the tax revenue they generate. Delaware, Massachusetts and New Jersey are the holdouts. "

0,"What Liberals Demand Parents Do This Christmas is UNBELIEVABLE, And They Are Fighting To Make This A LAW! We all know that the left has never been silent when it comes to how they feel you should raise your children. They have a strong belief that they know better than you when it comes to your kid. This Christmas, liberals are adding a new demand to their long list of complaints. They have started a campaign titled No Gender December. The goal is to stop parents from buying toys that gender stereotype their children, and stop children from playing with gender based toys. From the No Gender December website: Christmas brings a myriad of catalogues and gift guides selling kids toys. Many toy retailers use gendered marketing which influences children and consumers alike, by sending strong messages about the appropriateness of their choices. Color codes, labels and imagery all have a narrowing effect on our childrens perspectives. The article linked to the website talks about how much boys need feminism as well. The writer claims that we need to do more to educate parents and teachers. She is upset about kids being segregated by gender at school, like seating children in boy, girl arrangements or lining up in boy, girl lines. I guess it isnt enough to ban gender bias toys, now they dont even want teachers to refer to your child as a certain gender. It is all part of a new trend liberals have created called gender neutral parenting. Under this new style of parenting, you dont teach your child that they are a boy or a girl, you ask THEM what gender they feel they are at that moment. The whole thing sounds ridiculous to me, but millions of people actually take this stuff seriously. This craziness has gone all the way to the United Nations. Mother Thea Hughess group Play Unlimited started the campaign, which she says has the support of the UN Convention on the rights of the child. These nuts are not just complaining; they are trying to pass legislation to stop gender-based marketing all over the world. Campaigners are calling for blue and pink toy aisles to be scrapped, and federal legislation to stop advertisers showing only boys or girls playing with particular toys. if you stand up to pee your male, if you sit down to pee your female whats the confusion?? There, theyre, their, grammar Nazis, calm down. Everything will be ok. there are boys and girls ,no matter what these liberal ass holes say ,stay away from my kids Liberals own all the ghettos and if a city does not have on they will make one. That shows just how much they know about raising you kids. Just helping the real Liberal with his reading Anne Dear. Calm down. Screw the Liberals, its time to go to war against their entire agenda! Conservatives have sat on the sidelines long enough. Enough is enough and this just crossed that line. Well at least I know how to have a conversation without having to name call and use profanity. Have a nice life And what part of my comment do you object to? Do I not have the right to object to the whole gay agenda being forced on us? Do you feel that I dont have the right to express the opinion that homosexuality is perverted and wrong? Gender neutrality is more of the same gay garbage that is an abomination and an affront to people of nearly all major religions. What they, or you, do in the privacy of your bedroom is your choice. All I ask is that you keep it there, not force it upon the rest of us. Liberalism is a Mental and Social Disease, and should be treated as such. More liberal focus on the trivial? Why dont you address the issue instead of nitpicking? If you wouldnt say something in a real world public place, then it shouldnt be said in a public internet place. Lets be honest about the existence of the internet, it is real. Just because something is posted on the internet rather than said out loud doesnt make discretion any less important. I dont mean to pile on Pamela, but if her children were a little older (Im only guessing at their ages based on her photo), they could easily find her internet history and see what she wrote. Its entirely likely that they wouldnt be able to discern that she was just venting and would then get the message that its okay to round up and kill people just for having different political views. I think that we can all agree that a world where the next generation believes this to be true is not a place that we want to be. It is equally important to consider comments made on the internet as it is comments made in person. Pamela, I appreciate that youre not serious about rounding people up, I just dont see the fact that it was on the internet as an excuse for why its okay to say it even if you dont mean it. I think it is important to note that this whole thing is about neutrality, and affects advertisers and not parents. The point of this is that if Barbies and G.I. Joes are both packaged in the same color (or at least gender neutral colors), then children wont subconsciously get the message that Barbies are for girls and G.I. Joes are for boys. This does nothing to affect how parents raise their children. It actually gives parents MORE freedom to raise their children how they see fit by removing some of the influences that advertisers have over their children. So, to everyone claiming that the left is trying to tell me how to raise my kids, thats just incorrect. Whats going on here is that some people from one end of the political spectrum are trying to give you more power over the advertisers that have managed to wiggle their way into all the other aspects of your life. Please, for all of our sakes, just calm down and think about this for a few moments longer. Wow, just wow. Talk about keeping crappy ideas to themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms. In all fairness, youre right about their being much bigger problems. However, the people mentioned in this article arent telling anybody how to raise their children, theyre telling advertisers how to advertise. Also, just because something isnt in the top 20 list of problems does that mean that nobody should try and fix it? Im pretty sure there are people trying to fix child abuse as well. Advertising messes with peoples kids in much more harmful ways than a bill that doesnt actually change anything for children or parents. This proposed bill will affect what marketing companies would use, not what parents can buy for their children or what children can choose to want. So actually, once you consider whats being proposed, nobody is messing with you or your kids. Its also worth noting that this bill will affect ADVERTISERS and not PARENTS. That, I believe, is the root of Davids comment. The left (as a whole) is not crazy enough to try to push into law that parents cant buy pink stuff for girls, theyre pushing for law that marketing must be gender neutral. The right (in part, not everyone) is being crazy by misrepresenting what is going on and getting people all riled up about it. Not sure if you understand how rights work. I have the right to voice my offense. Thats it. I understand that me being offended means nothing to you, but perhaps it will mean something to somebody else. And by the way, claiming to be middle of the road means that some of the time you agree with the conservative agenda and sometimes you agree with the liberal agenda. It means that youd rather use your own mind when concerning an issue, rather than just toe the party line. Im sorry that you have such a narrow view of the world, it doesnt serve you well, and it doesnt serve the other people who live in this world with you well. You need to be fucking ashamed because youre advocating murdering people by firing squad for having a different political view from you. Youre also (intentionally or not) teaching this view to your children, which means its going to be perpetuated in the world. Thats not just shameful, thats fucking shameful. These stupid perverts keep trying to screw kids and families up. Let the kids play with whatever toys they want, and the gayfascists should keep their crappy ideas to themselves in the privacy of their bedrooms and out of our livingrooms. I ALWAYS bought Gender Neutral things for my son, even 25 years ago . . . . Musical Instruments !!! Tell liberals to F-OFF my kids make a list of what they would like and I base buying gifts from those list no dreaming lib is going to tell me what to buy for my kids! Wow, thats very Christian of you. My son and daughter both played with trucks and Legos. My son never felt a desire to play with a doll, but he did have several stuffed animals as a kid. Both of them turned out pretty damn well, if I do say so. United Nations should be concerning itself with children in this world who are enslaved, getting their genitals mutilated and being bought and sold for sex. not whether or not I buy my daughter a girl toy or not! Stupid, Worthless, POS, alleged organization! Our Constitution is the Supreme Law of Our Land! First, Foremost, Always!! Screw a UN! We dont need em! Jus sayin Anyway* So I guess if a boy wants a dress for Christmas they promote this too right!! This is a bunch of crap Theyre playing with fire when it comes to messing with peoples kids. I checked the site out. And found onaround 1400 individuals that took their pledge. Its like saying theres something wrong with being a boy or girl. They want a metrosexual socieity. Why is it wrong to raise a boy to be a boy? Or heaven forbid raise a girl to be a girl. Theres some twisted minds out in the world. Has so many lost the concept of reality. I was such a tomboy in childhood. Wanted nothing to do with dolls or anything and my momma respected that. I turned out just fine and actually wear pink on occasion (rare). Liberals need to mind their own business. Oh my aching a$$, why dont they just mind their own business and let parents raise their own children. Heres the issue though and why I feel some may be offended, my self included. Im absolutely tired of all of this left-right bs that goes on. Why cant we all get along? Why do we have to stereotype everyone? As a Left, Liberal I think this article, and supposed bill, is absolutely insane! Yet in your comments here, you lump me into the same category as these people, just because Im Liberal? In my humble opinion, that is a true testament to ignorance. And Karen who initiated the above postLoad all Libs into a rocket ship, send them to their own planet!!?? Really? If I was as narrow minded and intolerant, I might suggest we do the same for those who stereotype via ignorance. But then I supposed Id be just like you. Ignorance Pamelaenough said! David, Amen!!! See my post above! So sick of left-right BS! Its so ignorant and petty. As a Liberal parent, I am far from the lunacy mentioned in this article! Im sure if we had time to waste, we could find articles on Right Wing Conservative parents pushing lunacy as well. Dont stereotype the masses based on a few! Quit lumping liberals into one group! Im liberal at times, and conservative on occasion too! What Im sick of is this left-right banter BS that YOU keep stereotyping us into! As a more liberal parent, my daughter is well rounded and quite a well raised kid! And guess whats on HER Christmas list.spy gear, night goggles, a scooter and Air Hogs! Being a Liberal doesnt automatically make us a bad parent, or worthy of being lumped into this lunacy of an article!! Get over yourself and your Right Wing crap! I am so sick to death of liberal lunatics trying to mandate how other people should raise their children. I was and still am a tomboy at heart. Hated playing with any dolls or girlie crap. Still dont like fu fu stuff much at all. Having said that to force people to not have gender toys and call kids boys or girls is outrageous. Just stop it already. Why dont we focus on kids in poverty, or the ones being abused physically or sexually if we are really concerned about childrens welfare. Really what toys they play with isnt a concern that should even be on the top 20 list of problems facing the youth of the world. For the love of God whats next. Im afraid to find out. look up U.N. treaties and you will see for yourself I tried to post the link for you but it is still pending. These people are off their freakin rockers. Tell them all to piss off. What if they asked for for them? Would you then buy it for them? I figured has much! I try never to get offended by what some people say here as some times they are just venting and it does not mean anything for in the real world they would never do such a thing. No it does not mean you stand for nothing. What you stand for is all the good and sane stuff. I do not like abortion but I will not put my nose into others women business. What I want is for all women to have birth control as soon as they think they first want to have sex and if they do not want to tell their Parents for what ever reason so be it, they should be able to get it free if need be, and that will bring down the number of abortions. That is just one thing the middle of the road believe in. I believe Vets should get 100% free medical for life if they were injured in any way in battle and that includes PTSD. Well there is more for the middle believes in some of the right side and some of the left side and plain old common since. Sane people add their own punctuation! The Drama and Grammer Nazis are always a laugh. But like I said sane people get what you write and do not worry their heads over mistakes made. For the grammer mistakes etc. are a nothing problem when it comes to the REAL problems in the world today. Gender Neutral is crap! But giving girls more choices then just the house wife/Mommy toys to play with is short changing our Daughters and our Sons. I hope if your Daughter wants a truck and not a doll or your son wants a doll and not a truck for Christmas you are giving them what they want and not what you think they should want because they are a Girl and a Boy. But I do agree this Gender Neutral crap only confuses them. I am a Great Grand Mother now but I was raised by Parents and Grand Mother too. I was given many dolls and other girl toys for birthdays and Christmas. But I was and still am a Tom boy and my girl toys where like new when my half Sisters where born 10 and 12 years after me so they got them all to play with. If I wanted to play house I used my stuff animals and my real dogs and kitties. In fact I had one cat who would let me dress her up with doll clothes and push her around in the doll pram. I also played with my fave toys which were a bike and skates. I climbed trees, rode down the street on my bike with no hands and all kind of dare devil stunts that you think only boys do. What I am getting at is children will be what they will be if left alone to do what they want or do not want to do. True it is good that toy makers are giving girls more choices like they give boys. I gave my Grand Son and my Grand Daughter both doll strollers for Christmas one year. Now my Grand Daughter is what I call a Girly Girl loving pink and all girl stuff and my Grand Son is all boy ruff and tough she used her stroller to transport her baby dolls around the house he used his to transport is stuff teddy bear running around the house and ramming into his Sisters stroller. I did not get a Tom Boy like me until the one grand Daughter came along all the rest are proper boys who are little speed demons and the proper Girly Girls. Like I said Children will be what they will be but boys and girls should be given both views of the world so they can be what they want to be. Be a girl football player or a boy home decorator, a male nurse or a girl Pilot. All children should be given choices but we should back away and let them choose what they like , what they want. Oh the reason boys line up in one line and girls in another is because if you go and watch the children you will see the boys pushing and picking on each other and laughing and the Girls will be talking to each other and laughing to each other. Girls do not want to be in a line with the boys who push and shove and boys do not want to be in line with the girls who tell on them for picking on them. You got that? So do not force all the liberal thinking on kids let them be what ever they want to be and play with what ever they want to play with, do that and they will be what they want to be. When they pay my bills then i might take suggestions but until that time stay the f#%k out of my life and leave my kids alone they have their own personalitys, we dont want a know it all who wants This is utter stupidity. I raised 2 girls and 2 boys. The girls are now self reliant young women and the boys are self reliant young men.All can cook and all can hunt. All can clean toilets and all can work on their cars. They all played with dolls and all played with trucks but that doesnt change the fact that the girls are girls and the boys are boys. I raised them all that girls can do anything and so can boys just that girls are often more delicate and always more beautiful and are to be treated like the China where the boys are metal camping plates.both serve the same purpose but you dont treat the China like you do the plates I say tell them to kiss my ass, I will buy what I want and when I want for my kids. From what I can see, I do not want my kids being as screwed up as theirs. Look at the liberal side and look at their kids their a mess. To everyone I offended, I was being sarcastic about the firing squad, venting my frustrations and it was not my intention to upset anyone. I dont get whats so offensive about not delineating gender by color or genre of toy. If a girl wants to train with a gun, she shouldnt be forced to sport a Barbie logo on the barrel. And if a boy feels like playing with a homemakers set, why cant he have one that isnt covered in little flowers and shit? Girls shoot guns; boys cook and clean. Neither of them does either of those exclusively, so why should we program them through their Christmas presents to think that way? Wow, that escalated quickly. Not even talking about my feelings on this article. You really want to round people up and kill them? Simply because they think differently than you? Wow It was not my intention to offend anyone, especially a Vet, with my opinions of how I feel about this. Why do I need to be f***ing ashamed, wouldnt ashamed be enough? Ive never believed in the whole boy colors /girl colors thing or toys for boys and toys for girls thing just as Ive never believed in the mans work and womans work crap. Ill let a boy play with a baby doll as much as I will let a girl play with hotwheels and never think twice about it. Grant it I wont give a boy and female doll or a girl a male doll as some dolls are made with genitals these days and then boxes arent always labeled That being said, its no ones business how I raise my kids as long as they are not being abused or neglected. You liberal idiots need to first learn what the word liberal means before you label yourselves. My girls may take out the trash, mow the lawn and learn to change oil as well as my boys do and my boys may wash dishes, vacuum and learn how to cook and sew as well as my girls do but they do know what gender they are and why shouldnt they? My brothers and I played with both hotwheels and dolls as children. its the left that is pushing for itNOT THE RIGHT don`t worry Jessie.some people are going to complain regardless.. Since when did you get the right to not be offended. And by the way when people claim to be middle of the road, that just means youre a liberal who doesnt stand for anything. Im not going to buy my nephew a Barbie doll any more than Id buy a little girl G.I. Joe toys. Theyre kids let them be kids and if you want yours to be gender neutral. As a politically middle of the road disabled Veteran I find this offensive Pamela. I wouldnt want any money raised by killing people simply for being concerned about the children of our nation to contribute to my benefit in any way. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself. I was getting my kid ready for school so I didnt take the time to proofread my comment and anyways I always love how wonderfully irritated people become when my sentences run on and on and on or if I use the wrong too or when I write or too much or when I change from present tense to past tense and back again all in one sentence. Rocket ships are expensive, how about a good old fashioned firing squad. We could sell tickets for a chance to be on the squad and use the money raised to helps Vets or pay it toward our national debt. I thought this was too STUPID to be true but I have found numerous articles and the websites promoting this crap. Just keep breathing while reading her run-on sentence. Makes it easier. At least they could teach the kid punctuation.. i wish we could load all the libs onto a rocket ship, send them to their own planet, and let us have our own sane existence. These people have fruit loops for brains! Whatever is the zaniest, most nonsensical fantasy they can dream up, they decide to label necessary. Put these people in straight jackets and send them where they cannot hurt themselves or the rest of this planet. United Nations Convention on the rights of the child needs more attention gender neutral is the least of its dangers please discuss how they want to undermine our parental rights in the areas of discipline and religion and schooling and how if ratified we could be taken to court and our children could be removed from our care even based on something so small as the child disagreeing with their being grounded! Can we put these fruit loops on their own island, in the middle of the ocean, without a boat? Go to the website and see for yourself, they are lobbing for this to be Law Sometimes the claims of the Right are so crazy you just cant believe them. Show me the bill before I can believe that the Left is really as stupid as that. Remember you are trying to convince people who did not vote for Obama 365 times each election. These people are what is wrong in our country. It has been working for centuries and you want to change it. You see what you change did in 2008. Now we have loonies trying to change this country. SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE HELL UP. I have 2 children. Each gets their treatment as to whatever gender they were born. God made them what they are and thats how they are raised.

0,"Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson Finks Out On Religious Freedom Restoration Act In a move that will infuriate the very people religious liberty laws are meant to protect, Arkansas Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, refused to sign the Religious Freedom Restoration Act the Arkansas state legislature passed that as of last week he fully supported. Instead, he has asked for changes to the bill in order for it to mirror the 1993 act signed by then President Bill Clinton. What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance and secondly, we make sure that we communicate were not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future, Hutchinson said at a news conference at the state Capitol. Theres all those progressive buzzwords again. The goal, of course, is to make it next to impossible to discriminate against gays and lesbians in the business sector specifically in the wedding industry where religious business owners have opted to not do commerce with gays and lesbians seeking to marry. Hutchinson is the second Republican governor this week to experience the national microscope from the gay lobby on this issue. This move comes days after Indiana Governor Mike Pence came under fire for signing a law that is similar to the legislation passed by the Arkansas legislature. And still, lost in the argument is the irony of suspending one groups rights in favor of anothers using the concept of individual liberty. Related: Walmart CEO Tells Arkansas Governor: Dont Sign Religious Freedom Law So instead, hes going to discriminate against Christians and their right to NOT violate their consciences! He doesnt care what the voters want, or what their elected representatives have passed, hes going to buckle to a gay lobby and a corporate CEO. Guess Arkansas voters now know who he really represents, dont they. If he keeps buckling on the issues that he was elected to protect, then he will find himself looking for another job! Shame shame shame on him! Spineless and stands for nothing so he buckles for anything! "

0,"Man SUCKED FROM PLANE After Cabin Explodes! *UPDATE story published 2/5/16 11,000 feet in the air, a gaping hole was blown in the side of a commercial plane bound for Djibouti late Tuesday. Fire erupted and smoke filled the cabin. The clothes of a male passenger caught on fire. Then the unthinkable happened. The man was sucked out of the plane through the hole created by the blast. Authorities in the Balcad region confirmed that the body of a man, believed to be about 55 years old, was recovered. He dropped when the explosion occurred in the plane, one police officer stated. The dead body of the passenger is being transported to Mogadishu. The Airbus A321 plane had originally taken off from the Mogadishu airport in Somalia. The pilot,Vladimir Vodopivec, was able to turn the plane around and make a safe landing back there after the explosion. He spoke to reporters after landing. Luckily, the flight controls were not damaged so I could return and land at the airport. Something like this has never happened in my flight career. Vodopivec also stated that authorities told him that it was most likely an explosive device that caused the incident. That matches the opinion of John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety and aviation safety expert. There are only two things that could have caused a hole in the plane that looks like the one in photos circulated online a bomb or a pressurization blowout caused by a flaw or fatigue in the planes skin. The photos appear to show black soot around the aircraft skin that is peeled back. A pressurization blowout wouldnt create soot, but a bomb would. 2 other people suffered injuries, but all the remaining 74 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft upon its return. Among those on board was Awale Kullane, Somalias deputy ambassador to the U.N. Somali Aviation Authority has not yet established what caused the blast. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox News "
0,"[Watch] Sheriff Paul Babeu - Money Obama Wants To Legalize Illegals Would Pay For Fence, Staffing, Security There is no doubt that border security is an impediment to the goals of B. Hussein Obama. If he wanted to secure the border, it would already be done. He wants instead to have an open border through which he can import his future voting bloc as well as enough criminals and terrorists to accomplish whatever other destabilizing or manipulative goals he may have. Sheriff Paul Babeu is Neil Cavutos guest and he describes how the $3.7 billion dollars that Obama has requested simply supports amnesty at the expense of security. Babeu points out how, ironically, the figure of $3.7 billion is exactly the amount that the GAO said would be required to secure the border. For that expenditure, we could purchase 700 miles of 14 foot high, corrugated steel no-climb fencing, as well as fund 6,000 troops and provide the necessary technology to successfully defend our nation. We would also be free of the expense associated with supporting illegal aliens and more effectively utilize the money being spent on the war on drugs. He says, Instead, what the president is doing here, is wasting this money, because there is no enforcement of law. There are no consequences for breaking the law. Babeu says, What hes doing is sending an invitation to the millions and millions of illegals who will come from Mexico and Central America in the future, by saying if you get to the border, youre home free, youre welcomed with open arms. Babeu says there is no law for people from foreign countries who come here, disrespect our country and its immigration process, and were made to feel somehow as the bad guys, in this process. And this is America turned up on its head. Asked by Neil Cavuto whether he believes border security is part of the package, Sheriff Babeu answers, Its a lie. Ive seen it a hundred times from this administration and details just some of the experiences hes had in dealing with DHS and the regime that tell him unmistakably that border security and Obama dont mix. He says It is outrageous that we in America do not have sovereign borders that we can protect and secure. The sheriff adds, It is insulting to the American people and the rule of law that he is failing to address a problem of this magnitude.

0,"Kerrys Terrorist Nation Building May Have Hit A Snag John Kerry brought his manure spreader to a meeting in Paris with the new French Foreign Minister as well as diplomats from Britain, Germany and Italy. Kerry gave a speech in which cited the Syrian civil war as being the cause of the Islamic invasion of Europe, although most of the refugees are economic and not Syrian. Lying is what the Obama regime and apparently their European counterparts are joining with them in telling this tall tale. Its particularly important for Germany but France as well to sell the lie. They dont want to be accused of ruining their countries without a good reason. Obama and Kerry have been insistent that Assad must go for a long time, since shortly after they drew the pink line in the sand over chemical weapons and Russia joined in helping them make a laughing stock of themselves. Theyve learned a lot from their failure in installing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and their rousing success in Libya, the Islamic paradise. Building on that Libyan model, theyre aggressively working against the clock to accomplish their regime change before leaving office. Assad must surrender; hell get the same protections they gave Gaddafi, no reason to cling to power. Kerry addressed the audience, telling them how strongly he supports the efforts of their UN puppets, saying there isnt a person standing there who doesnt understand how difficult the process is. Difficult does not necessarily equate with justified or proper. Kerry sounds miffed at the arrogance of the Foreign Minister of Syria. He was clearly trying to disrupt the process of the overtaking of their country by a cabal of Western nations in conjunction with their terrorist freedom fighter allies. Its not because of Gitmo that they hate us, Kerry, its because you people cant stop meddling in their affairs in your endless attempts to fundamentally transform their nation into what you want it to be. The freakish Secretary of State exposed some problems in the process by falling back on a posture of intimidation and thinly-veiled threats. He argued his case much too strongly for things to be going according to plan. He stressed the existence of weak commitments by Iran and Russia to an approach that dictates there must be a political transition and that we must move towards a presidential election at some point in time. The weak negotiating skills of the American A team is once again on display in Kerrys comments. Just as with the nuclear deal, Iran already has him tied up. The terminology of a political transition is open to broad interpretation. Likewise, a movement towards a presidential election could be something as insignificant and meaningless as having ballots printed which are never used. When Hell freezes over is technically a point in time, Mr. Secretary. Kerry says, If we dont want to be back here next year, or even the year after, facing a Middle East with even more refugees, even greater numbers of dead and displaced, even more suffering and erosion of hope, it is vital that people exert leadership and deliver on the cessation of hostilities. Comments like that indicate hes not getting the cooperation he expected or that nobody cares what he and his big- eared master say anymore. He goes on to spread another shovelful of his favorite organic substance before he goes, saying, In the long run, the only way to actually end this challenge of refugees is to end the Syrian civil war. What guarantee does Kerry purport to be able to offer that making room for his preferred Islamic extremists to replace Assad will stop Syrians from leaving their country? Havent Iraq and Libya taught them anything? Then again, judging from the current situation the regime has created in the United States, chaos is exactly what theyre looking for, of the extreme Islamic variety.

0,"[Watch] Raven Refuses to Call Herself African American Oprah Flips Out Raven Symone had Oprah Winfrey raising eyebrows and nearly falling out of her chair with a statement made during an interview yesterday. Oprah predicted the poised actresses words would set Twitter on fire. And she was not wrong! You may remember Raven as Olivia on the The Cosby Show or as Raven from the Disney Channel Series, Thats So Raven. In questioning the actress on her personal life, Oprah, who has interviewed many guests over the years, literally had to take a few moments to collect herself when the younger woman told her, Im tired of being labeled. Im an American; Im not an African-American. Im an American. Fanning herself and shaking her head, Oprah laughed and asked her to clarify. Raven, in a confident, no-nonsense manner, expounded on her controversial statement: I dont know where my roots go to, I dont know how far back they go. I dont know what country in Africa Im from. But I do know that my roots are in Louisiana. Im an American, and thats a colorless person, because were all people. I have lots of things running through my veins. Oprah, taken aback once more by this confident and poised young woman, told the actress she would get a lot of flak for saying youre not African-American. The reply was just as calm and poised as the rest of the interview had been: I dont label myself. When asked what she really meant by that, Ravens reply was: What I really mean by that is that Im an American. Thats what I really mean. I have darker skin; I have a nice, interesting grade of hair; I connect with Caucasian, I connect with Asian, I connect with black, I connect with Indian. I connect with each culture. Still shaking her head in disbelief, Oprah commented: You are a melting pot in one body. Raven asked: Arent we all? Isnt that what Americas supposed to be? How about us all being American, whether we are born in America or if you are a naturalized American. I deplore labels and hyphenation. I am adopted so I dont know what my ancestry is. I take people as they are, not by something as irrelevant as melatonin levels in a persons body. I truly try to abide by Dr. Kings dream. You got to love her honesty, because unless you are born in a country, you cant claim it as yours! She and anyone else born in United States is AMERICAN! My neighbor is the only true african american I personally know he was born in south africa his family lives there still and hes as white as can be The race baiters cant stand unity because then theyre out of a job Amen brother Has everyone forgotten Jesse Jackson calling Obama the N word when he didnt think the mic was on You had to reach for that one and by doing so became one of the ilk mentioned. You sound kind of ignorant to me. FYI Ive met Raven and shes an amazing strong woman that wont be defined by anyone but herself. I agree with her 100 % / 100 % not because she said what ever she said, but because I see it that way. Clearly Oprah was not serious in that bit which I can clearly tell she was joking and trying to be funny. I think some people will call that sarcasm. So you need to re-watch the clip over and over because you dont get it. I wondered about this so I actually asked a very black man why they called themselves African-American when very few had ever been to Africa even and most probably couldnt even find it on the map. He said I dont know and I think it is stupid. If you are an American citizen, you are American. I am American, period!! Thank you Raven, you have strength and compassion, you know more than people twice yup years. Yes you are an American and a good one at that. You are a role-model for women and girls of all races all over this country. You should be so proud of yourself. Oprah, needs to get a clue. Oprah should know better. I once looked at her as a mentor for all women. I dont now. Thank you for being the wonderful woman you have become! That is the only way there will be peace. Absolutely love her,, I am an American not a European American.. WE ARE ALL Oprah is a fraud in any color. And a blame thrower like yourself should be ashamed. Shut Oprah you big fat racist witch. Raven is the real deal. A beautiful BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN young woman of class and dignity. She is not from Africa. And Raven knocks it out of the park. This is the point, she has spoken truth to power and power just cant figure it out. did you even watch the video? Watch Oprahs reaction in the first 10 second!!!! Stop, STOP STOP!!!! That was all she could say!!!! She is a true racist. and that is HER label!!!! Thank you thank you raven I am glad some are waking up!!! Like u said we are Americans no mater what color we are!!!! Thank you again!!!! Shes got it nailed. Im an American of German and Croatian descent. If Im anything Im Navy-American. GO NAVY, BEAT ARMY. Im from St Louis. You know, furguson? Supposed to come up with a decision soon on the mike brown shooting. Please pray for St. Louis. Thank you. Dis you all see Mia Loves response to CNN when they tried to put her in a racist box? LOL!!! Shes brilliant!!! Harvard graduate from hatian immigrant parents who were very poor. They knew the value of discipline and work. Mia won in an all white district. Historical because they voted American values. African American refers to any one of any race who had African citizenship and is now an American. It doesnt fit someone because they are Black, or Negroid which is the real name of the Black race wether they like it or not. Ilk meaning people who are racist. A person doesnt have to be racist to see the obvious. Im sick of racism. Im white yes. I love everyone! Black people rock! To judge a person based on the color of their skin is just wrong. I like nice people of all stripes! Raven is so right!!! Oprah doesnt like that because Oprah is very racist. Blacks wanting to be called African American is like me demanding to be called French American. That title is ridiculous. Oprah lost my respect and attention when she introduced that thing sitting in the White House on her show. She may have visited Africa, but she was not born there. Only someone who was born in Africa and legally migrated to America can actually call themselves African-American. If they were born in America, they are Americans only. Ophra should stop reminding people about Racisim and also stop encouraging America African only and think as American Only,this Country is full of Immigrants from All over the World and need to focus beeing American only without attaching Label,whoch Ophra is doing in Her All Shows,all She cares African American,with Her Wealth ,She can not buy Americans and also She Should Treat ALL People Equally,regardless HER/HIS origin.. Oprah was trying to strong arm her into changing her answer by saying she was going to get it on Twitter. I would say the same thing, if you were born he in the US, you are an American first and whatever else second. Blacks are American Africans, Latinos born in the US are American Latinos. Only those born in Africa and move to America can be African Americans. Canadians who are born in Canada and move the US are Canadian Americans, people who are born in America with roots in Canada are American Canadians. People want to use their race first and their country of birth second and that is not how it works. i didnt see Oprah flipping out in this clip smarter then fu ckin oprah My opinion. Yes we all have different skin color, different skin tone, different hair and eye color, all different shapes and sizes, and different languages. But we are ALL HUMAN, And WE ALL have RED blood flowing through our veins!!! Cool Im not Mexican American! Im an American! If you are an American, be an American! Best statement. Isen`t that what were suppose to be. All one people in America. This is not what the black leaders want their people to hear. Good job Girl, this is what God wants. Obama, Oprah need the race card just in case they feel intimidated Look at the Russell Wilson situation with the Seahawks. A lot of his teammates were claiming that he wasnt black enough because hes educated and well spoken, and doesnt get in trouble. Charles Barkley pointed out that its a dirty little secret that well educated, successful, well spoken black people are often looked down upon because they dont fit the lifestyle. Theres your problem to ending racism. When you have a entire group of people within the race projecting certain stereotypes it becomes an almost immovable obstacle. Bravo Raven Symone for standing up in the face of guaranteed criticism. YESSSSS WTG girl your all AMERICAN. if your not born in africa your not african-american..if your a citizen of the united states then your AMERICANway to tell them im so proud of you Why? Why would her saying she is an American cause such a controversy? Because others need her to be in their box. Its gross, its racist! Nothing wrong with calling a spade a spade, no pun intended. Her ilk consists of people like Sharpton, Jackson and Obama. You dont see Herman Cain, Allen West, or Ben Carson spouting this racist garbage, but then they are all class and not crass. Exactly right! We are all Americans in this country. We are not white Americans or black Americans or Hispanic Americans, we ARE Americans!! This is an extremely intelligent woman!! If Oprah hasnt gotten it by now, shell never get it, just like Sharpton and Jackson, but then they wouldnt be in business if they werent racist. Oprah made her millions off mostly whites watching her show before she became so racist so she really should shut up! i love this girl who has the guts to stand up to the black establishment and especially the racist Opera Ms. Raven is absolutely right! Thats how America should be and must be! You are an American african-american is just a fancy name that negros made up to try and make them look better Her ilk? You sound kind of racist to me. I love it.. She gets it Oprah, the racist white-hater, will never get it.. Shell just going on race-bating with the rest of her ilk.. Intelligent girl, end racism! THATS CORRECT YOU ARE AN AMERICAN "

Hot chocolate, milkshakes, chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, brownies, candy, cookies, chocolate chips, pies, puddings Imagine a world without any chocolateFrightening, isnt it? Look out, preppers, theres a new kind of Doomsday coming round, and everyone better get prepared. A woman without chocolate? Make that millions of women who cant get chocolate Whew! Watch out, I doubt there will be many survivors left after that rampage! In all seriousness, two of the biggest names in the decadent dessert, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut, are telling the world consumers are eating too much of it. They think that by 2030, the deficit could reach 2 million tons, citing last years deficit where consumers ate (or drank) about 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. They say the dry weather in areas where it is commonly grown, frosty pod fungal disease, the rising popularity of dark chocolate (which contains about 60% more cocoa than regular), and the fact that farmers are choosing to grow easier crops like corn and rubber have all led to this deficit. John Mason of Ghana-based Nature Conservation Research Council told the Independent that in 20 years, chocolate will be like caviar. It will become so rare and expensive that the average Joe just wont be able to afford it. Before you go choco-crazy, there is a bit of hope in this dark crisis (pun intended). According to Bloomberg, farmers in Costa Rica are working on several new cacao plant breeds that will be easier for farmers in other parts of the world to grow, breeds resistant to the damaging diseases that have wiped out so much of Womans Sanity Serum lately. However, they say it takes almost two years for the seedlings to produce fruit, and 10 more years for the flavor to get just right. Joseph Dutra, owner of Kimmie Candy Company, also gives women reason to hope. There wasnt a crop deficit this year. We had one of the biggest crops weve ever had in cocoa, but speculators have kept the market up high. Adding that things tend to balance themselves out after a period of time. The prices go up, more people will grow cocoa beans, prices go down, less people will grow and we have to raise prices back up so its sustainable. Though he did tell reporters chocolate prices will be going up come January, so if you want save a buck, start stockpiling. Firstly, a woman without chocolate is like a woman 3+/- days every month (to mens perceptions, LOL). "
0,"[Watch] Joe Biden Goes Rogue On ISIS: We Will Follow Them To The Gates Of Hell The official response of the Obama administration to the recent beheading of two Americans in Syria by ISIS has been muddled at best. The often timid and tepid statements by various White House spokesman, the State Department, and even the President himself in response to these specific tragedies and the general threats poised by ISIS have been vague, confusing, contradictory, and sometimes downright silly. (You do know that the members of ISIS are Muslims right? The White House apparently isnt even sure on that one.) Though the sharpness of the rhetoric by both Obama and Secretary of State Kerry has increased somewhat in the last day or two, only very limited airstrikes have been carried out over the last few weeks and in a stunning statement Obama admitted that his administration has no strategy yet for dealing with the ISIS strongholds and bases of power in Syria. And according to the State Department ISIS isnt even at war with the US. Tell that to James Foley and Steven Sotloff and the blasted to bits ISIS fighters around the Mosul dam. Very similar statements were made in regards to pre 9-11 Al Qaeda, and the seeming hesitancy to acknowledge the truth of the situation by the current administration is somewhat disturbing. In stark contrast to the muddling mediocrity oozing from Washington, potential presidential wannabe Vice President Joe Biden took to the road, and took it upon himself, to take a very hard stand against ISIS in regards to their latest outrages against the civilized world. Biden on Wednesday delivered a fiery response to the killing of American journalist Steven Sotloff, calling ISIS barbarians and letting them know that the U.S. will follow them to the gates of hell. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. They somehow think that its going to lessen U.S. resolve, frighten us, intimidate us. But, if they think the American people will be intimidated, they dont know us very well The American people are so much stronger, so much more resolved than any enemy can fully understand When people harm Americans, we dont retreat. We dont forget. We take care of those who are grieving, and when thats finished, they should know, we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice. Because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside. With the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination in his hoped for future, this speech may be the first breakout attempt by Joe Biden to distance himself from the many failed policies and numerous disappointments of the Obama administration and appear more in line with public opinion and outrage. Can you imagine Barack Obama saying or acting like this in regards to an enemy other than House Republicans or Fox News? The taint of the Obama era is not something you want sticking with you if you going to run for president, and it will be a burden to either a Clinton or Biden candidacy. This may be the new face of a new Biden who sounded more like a Bush-era neocon evoking 9-11 and bin Laden than a ranking member of an administration that ran and won a campaign based on abandoning Iraq at our earliest convenience. We are seeing the results of that failed Obama/Biden campaign pledge and policy play out now before our eyes and it appears that Crazy Uncle Joe is trying to get ahead of the entire issue by going out, talking tough, and being his own man. Anyway you look at it, he is articulating and peddling something that sounds significantly different from the official vacillating White House line. "
0,"FOUND HIM! Guess Which Billionaire Funded The Groups Involved In The Ferguson Disaster When it came to the chaos the world knows as Ferguson, anyone with a brain knew if the trees were shaken long enough some billionaire would fall out. Well, The Washington Times shook the right tree and out popped George Soros. It seems that Soros nonprofit machines have been dispensing cash to the groups that helped organize the natives in the latter part of 2014, launching #BlackLivesMatter and other slogans that are provocative and meaningless all at the same time. (All lives matter, truth be told.) In Ferguson, though, what we in St. Louis knew was happening, the outside world just refused to believe: Buses of activists from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference in Chicago; from the Drug Policy Alliance, Make the Road New York and Equal Justice USA from New York; from Sojourners, the Advancement Project and Center for Community Change in Washington; and networks from the Gamaliel Foundation all funded in part by Mr. Soros descended onFerguson starting in August and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month. Things in Ferguson have calmed down. The national groups are gone and all that is left is the nutty state Senator Maria Nicole Chappell-Nadal and her minions who are so outnumbered its not even funny. Just as we all suspected, after the initial forty-eight hours of anarchy in Ferguson after a white police officer shot and killed an 18-year old black man who was high on marijuana at the time, and charging him after grabbing for his gun, the people of one of the the above mentioned groups latched on to the peaceful discussions to use them for their own purposes. I went to Ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership, said Kassandra Frederique, policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, which was founded by Mr. Soros, and which receives $4 million annually from his foundation. She traveled to Ferguson in October. We recognized this movement is similar to the work were doing at DPA, said Ms. Frederique. The war on drugs has always been to operationalize, institutionalize and criminalize people of color. Protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about. Doing drugs doesnt respect personal sovereignty. Although, that may well be a religious argument. At any rate, the George Soros funded groups found common ground and decided to use the opportunity to not just advance their own causes, but do a little dirty PR at the same time. Ms. Frederique works with Opal Tometi, co-creator of #BlackLivesMatter a hashtag that was developed after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida and helped promote it on DPAs news feeds. Ms. Tometi runs the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, a group to which Mr. Soros gave $100,000 in 2011, according to the most recent of his foundations tax filings. I think #BlackLivesMatters success is because of organizing. This was created after Trayvon Martin, and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then, said Ms. Frederique. Its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words. Black Lives Matter is liberating, unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion. So its the George Soros funded groups that are linking two unrelated cases together and celebrating the culture of being a thug. The people who work directly for MoveOn.org, Open Society Foundation, and the other groups actually writing the checks are quick to point out that they do not have direct involvement in the decision making that Drug Policy Alliance and the other street level nonprofits conduct. However, if the Soros run shops did not approve of the smaller groups activities, they would not be writing six and seven figure bank notes to keep the doors open. George Soros has worked for years to destroy the United States by hook or by crook. His foundations sponsoring people who foment the street disturbances should be no great shock. What is most fascinating is that the only news outlet following the money rather than the narrative is The Washington Times. Their expose on the entire community organizing movement, now decades old, is worth the read. Ye shall reap what ye sowdefinition of karma. Jesus never mentioned Karma, David. He did say through St. Paul, whatever a man sows, that will he also reap. I understand what you are saying, but my God is personally involved in the process of sowing and reaping. Proves all the money in the world cant buy you class. Karma will handle him and maybe well get to watch. Muslim, right? Oooops. "

When I asked why not they gave me all kinds of nonsense about how they gave out signals and could be read by spies, etc. Same reason they tried to keep mobile phones out of the suite. I had numerous meetings with them. We even opened one up for them to try to explain to me why it was more dangerous than say, a remote control for one of the many tvs in the suite. Or something embedded in my shoe heel. They never satisfied me and NSA/CIA wouldnt back off. So, we just went about our business and stopped asking. I had an ancient version of a PDA and used it. In general, the suite was so sealed that it is hard to get signals in or out wirelessly. However, there is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Reading about the Presidents BB rules this morning, it sounds like it wont be as useful as it used to be. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data. You will find DS driving you crazy if you let them. They had Maddy tied up in knots. I refused to let them live in my house or build a place on my property. They found an empty garage half a block away. On weekends, I drove my beloved cars around town without them following me. I promised I would have a phone and not be gone more than an hour or two at Tysons or the hardware store. They hated it and asked me to sigh a letter relieving them of responsibility if I got whacked while doing that. I gladly did. Spontaneity was my security. They wanted to have two to three guys follow me around the building all the time. I said if they were doing their job guarding the place, they didnt need to follow me. I relented and let one guy follow me one full corridor behind just so they knew where I was if I was needed immediately. Their job is to keep you hermetically sealed up. Love, Colin Emphasis from Zero Hedge, but the reader gets the idea. Colin Powell actually DID coach Hillary Clinton on how to get around government security, even if he didnt really realize what he was doing at the time. Much of this appears to contradict the retired generals own words and assertions. It also explains somewhat why Hillary preferred older technology models, and why several of them were physically destroyed by the Clintons aides. And while this particular email does not relieve Hillary Clinton and her merry band of grifters from the guilt associated with email-gate, it does explain the lengths that security details will go to to be sure the whereabouts of their charges arent easy to find. The release of this particular email is very much political in nature. Cummings, one of the most forceful Democrats in the House of Representatives made that clear in his remarks. The exchange shows that Powell gave Clinton a detailed blueprint on how to skirt security rules and bypass requirements to preserve federal records, although Secretary Clinton has made clear that she did not rely on this advice, said Cummings.It also illustrates the longstanding problem that no secretary of State ever used an official unclassified email account until the current secretary of State, said Cummings. The Republican obsession with Secretary Clinton has reached a fever pitch, and they have been using taxpayer resources to single her out in a desperate and abusive attempt to hurt her presidential campaign, said Cummings. If Republicans were truly concerned with transparency, strengthening FOIA, and preserving federal records, they would be attempting to recover Secretary Powells emails from AOL, but they have taken no steps to do so despite the fact that this period including the run-up to the Iraq War was critical to our nations history, said Cummings. The obsession is actually now more about finding out just how many laws the woman brazenly broke moreso than any attempt to stop her presidential campaign. The reality is, as Powell did explain, that the Clintons had the private server set up for a year before she asked his advice. However, this also proves that Powell did do State business, official or not, on a private email account. And no, he has yet to provide those emails to the House in fulfillment of a Freedom of Information Act request. "
0,"[Watch] Reagans A Time For Choosing On The 50th Anniversary Fifty years ago today, Ronald Reagan made his political debut with the speech in the video below. Without a teleprompter, without a speechwriter and utilizing training that ultimately labelled him The Great Communicator, the face of the conservative movement outlined what it meant to choose in 1964 between Barry Goldwater and Lyndon Baines Johnson. To paraphrase the knight in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade America chose poorly. Reagan summed up the basic truth of choosing in the fourth minute of the speech: This idea that government beholden to the people it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and most unique idea in all the long history of mans relation to man. This is the issue for this election. Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. We are now living the nightmare Reagan outlined in 1964 dollars and ephemeral life only multiple times worse as a result of choosing socialism fifty years ago. In the next two elections, the midterms next week and the next presidential election, we must again choose. Do we choose those who can get us back to prosperity, although incrementally at times, or do we choose those whose final goal is our destruction. That is our choice, and sitting out the election is a de facto vote for the opposition whether we want it to be or not. H/T Lee Edwards at National Review "
0,"Hillary Clinton Wrath Aimed At Government Watchdog Another election cycle, another conspiracy to keep Hillary Clintons scandals in the news. At least thats the message coming from the Ready for Hillary camp. Back during her consorts presidency, the conspiracy was put forth by the vast right wing. This time, according to Bloomberg, The Hill and other left-leaning publications, the guilty party is the Inspector Generals (IG) office at the State Department. At this time, the IG at State is a man by the name of Steve Linick. Linick has been on the job since 2013, AFTER Hillary Clinton left the cabinet department. During her tenure there was no IG, no oversight on what she was up to as Secretary. Since last spring, Mr. Linick and his department have been working with Congress and the IG of the Intelligence Community to get through the piles of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for information regarding Mrs. Clintons improper email arrangement, members of her staff, and various incidents involving State Department personnel while she was Secretary. Given the string of bad news for Hillary Clinton coming from the IGs office, she reverted to form and now is spreading the word that the IG at the State Department is trying to stymie her political ambitions. After the newspaper the Hill published an anonymous accusation this week that Linicks office had an anti-Clinton bias and that Linick was excessively deferential to DiSanto, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta added that the anonymous sources accusations raised serious questions about the independence of this office. The DiSanto named in this quote is Emilia DiSanto who worked with Linick at the Federal Finance Housing Agency. When Linick took the State Department post, he brought DiSanto on board. DiSanto also has worked in the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), one of the people who is pushing for the release of all of Mrs. Clintons emails while she was Secretary of State. (Remember, Clinton had no IG oversight at the time.) Before this week, Linick, actually, had absolutely no taint of bias or partiality in Washington. What seems to be the goal of this finding of a new face for the vast right wing conspiracy is trying to get DiSanto off the IG team at State. After the hints were dropped and published by The Hill, a Clinton lackey picked up the baton. At issue seems to be a series of leaks damaging to Hillary Clinton that they claim were traced to Sen. Grassleys office, and published in the Washington Times. The Clinton camp has accused DiSanto of being the source, a charge both Grassleys office and the Washington Times deny. Legally, the people in the IG offices cannot speak on the record about ongoing investigations. Therefore, defending themselves in the media is not possible. In addition, the State Departments IG office is spending massive resources defending themselves from the inside against the Clinton campaigns allegations all while trying to satisfy countless FOIA requests about not just Clinton, but other Secretaries of State. It turns out she is not the only former occupant of that office to have used personal email to transmit classified information. Washington is a lot like a small town in many ways. Everyone knows everyone else. People in the cabinet departments do have connections on Capitol Hill. Hillary Clinton and her crew need to be careful with making accusations and insinuating improper behavior when many people in powerful places know better. Just because blaming the bogeyman worked before doesnt mean it will work again. "
0,"Girl Scouts, Thin Mints On Thin Ice With St. Louis Archbishop On February 18, Archbishop Robert Carlson of St. Louis issued a letter of concern to parishes throughout the archdiocese outright telling pastors that it would be a REALLY good idea to rethink the relationship with the Girl Scouts of America. The archbishop is most concerned that the Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri, and their parent group, Girl Scouts USA, and World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), are offering programs that teach young girls violations of the Catholic faith. Specifically (quoting the letter): 1. WAGGGS continued promotion of contraception and abortion rights on behalf of its girl members, the majority of whom are minors These are concerns that not just Catholics have about the Girl Scouts, but many people who believe in the sanctity of life and who abhor the hijacking of young people by liberals running organizations that seek to have a hand in the mental growth formation of children. Archbishop Carlson made it clear in his letter that this was not a sudden decision or recommendation, and that it has been made after dialogue and outreach with the Girl Scouts was done. What seems to be the issue that drove the final nail into the coffin of officially sanctioned Archdiocese-Girl Scout relations was the GSUSA published position on including transgender and homosexual lifestyles. (In Catholic teaching, being homosexual or otherwise sexually disordered is not sinful in and of itself. Acting on it, however, is.) Because the chartering organization is the Girl Scouts, and not the Catholic Church, there is no official way for the Church to control the message, even if the leaders in the parishes are doing their best to shield the girls from unwholesome ideas and messaging. Carlson did thank the leaders for these efforts, and praised these women for their bravery in the face of a culture increasingly hostile to the Catholic way of life, but now asks pastors to seriously reconsider allowing the troops access to the schools, and parish grounds, as well as considering scouting alternatives with a decidedly Christian bent to offer through the parishes. Our primaryobligation is to help our girls grow as women of God. Several alternative organizations exist, manyof which have a Catholic or Christian background. I askthat you carefully study each organization and strongly consider offering one of these programs your parish instead of Girl Scouts. This decision and letter, naturally, has been met with disappointment from the leadership of the Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri, many of whom are devout Catholics. Their position is that Carlson, and the Church, are threatened by the women in leadership messaging. (Have these women ever met nuns? Talk about leaders.) That, of course, misses the point of Carlsons recommendations to the pastors of the archdiocese. This is about a moral worldview, not women in leadership. As for the all important question of cookie sales, Carlson stopped short of recommending the faithful simply not purchase any. He specifically says that that decision is up to each individual and their conscience, as does membership in the organization, and, not mentioned, but definitely to be considered, the annual personal items drive that happens every April and collects hundreds of thousands of items like toothbrushes, shampoo, feminine hygiene products, and toilet paper for people who truly do need them. (This one is doable as it benefits the Girl Scouts only in publicity and helps a lot of people.) Carlson also expressed concern at a different level with the Boy Scouts of America, and will doubtless keep an eye on the transition of that organization as one that forms boys into productive young men into something far less honorable. In the meantime, the Catholic Committee on Girl Scouts has been disbanded in St. Louis and a Catholic Committee for Girls Formation has been instituted. This move has been met with some rancor and quite a bit of spirited discussion on social media. It is, however, the sign of a prelate who takes his job seriously who makes such a decision despite a century long relationship. Full disclosure: as a young Catholic in the Archdiocese of St. Louis and a girl scout for a few years, the system here is quite well developed and there are three quite nice camps that operate all summer for Girl Scouts. To give the reader an idea of this writers experiences there, she gave up the Girl Scouts for Lent one year and never went back. She also was a member of the Cathdral Choir the day Archbishop Carlson was installed. "
0,"TERRORIST SUCKED FROM PLANE! Epic Fail In Terror Attempt Terrific news! This is the best possible update to an earlier report about a passenger being sucked from the cabin of a commercial plane. The passenger reported to have been killed is none other than the terrorist who was trying to down the plane in the first place. Thats right! The jihadist managed to kill only himself. Theres no news like good news and this is the best kind. Not only is there one less terrorist in the world, but he managed to embarrass his cause on his way out. It is believed that the would-be bomber hid the explosive device in a wheelchair that he arrived in. The wheelchair allowed him to bypass security. Once on board, he is said to have switched seats without the notice of airline staff. Officials suspect that the man was part of the terror group Al Shabaab. Al Shabaab is an Islamist group in Somalia that has waged an insurgency against the Western-backed Somali government. The group has not, yet, claimed responsibility. Given the epic fail that the attempt turned out to be, it is unlikely that they will. Making an idiot out of yourself at 11,000 feet doesnt exactly make for a good propaganda video. Flight controls were unaffected when the explosion occurred. The pilot was able to make a safe landing back at the airport he had taken off from just a few minutes before. The charred remains of the jihadist were located from the town of Balad. Balad is about 20 miles from Mogadishu, where the airport is located. It is unknown whether the plane was targeted at random or because Somalias deputy ambassador to the UN, Awale Kullane, was on board. There were 2 passengers that sustained minor injuries, but no casualties other than the attacker, himself. Thankfully, he seems to have misunderstood the concept of suicide bomber. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Mirror "
0,"Liberals: Hypocrites Crucify Trump For The Same Tax Evasion They Do Over the weekend, someone at Trump Tower, supposedly, sent the New York Times a little gift. In the envelope was the 1995 tax filing of Donald J. and MARLA Trump. (That would be Marla Maples, the second wife.) What ensued from the playbook of the left, as Ann Coulter likes to call it, was a truly unseemly display of financial ignorance and hypocrisy. See, the very deductions Donald Trump took to reduce his tax burden just like everyone else in the United States does are the very same ones that people like Hillary Clinton take. Losses are allowed to be claimed as deductions. In Trumps case, the loss in 1995 was so large $915 million that it dwarfed his actual earnings that year. When one owns a business or is self-employed that is a risk taken. The majority of liberals commenting on the unfairness of the tax code in this case, have always worked FOR SOMEONE ELSE. This reality does not register with them. (A point to remember here, as has been mentioned by multiple bloggers and alternative writers, is that the 1995 loss was claimed while the Bill Clinton soak the rich taxes were in effect. There was also a retro-active tax that hit people like Donald Trump hard. That is reflected in that huge number.) What made the entire episode so maddening involved the GOTCHA! comments from friends and family thinking that the document was a smoking gun. It was nothing of the sort. Remember, EARNINGS are taxed, and if there are none, the government gets nothing. We do not tax wealth and assets in this country. At least not yet. Income taxes have already been paid on wealth and savings not accumulated through pre-tax programs and retirement plans. Do the liberals among us really think that a wealthy man is going to give up extra cash he legally doesnt have to just because? Would they? Lest anyone think that this writer is just typing to type, she used to be in the business of fundraising where the most important piece of mail any donor ever got from any organization was The Tax Letter. That documented contributions so that they could be legally deducted from a persons taxes. Year end contributions everywhere were generally made AFTER donors figured out how much they had to give in order to get the maximum deduction. It didnt (and doesnt) matter who the taxpayer was or is. Thats the way it works. What liberals accuse Mr. Trump of being is a law-abiding citizen who took advantage of the tax law just like everyone else does. (More on the code and laws themselves below.) What is worse is the accusation that this lack of payment caused material damage to the people of the country in the form of lost revenue that could have been used to build bridges and schools. The idea that a wealthy man living off of his savings, and not paying any taxes due to NO INCOME caused any capital assets not to be built is just ludicrous. Non-federal roads are financed locally, generally with municipal bonds and a gas tax. The interstate system is partially funded with a gas tax, which is consumption based, and even then the fed never pays the full freight. For example, the newest bridge over the Mississippi River in my hometown cost $667 million, or something like that. The Fed paid about a third of the total price tag for the actual span, and Missouri and Illinois paid for the approaches. That price is LESS than what Donald Trump lost in 1995. The best statement on what REALLY happens to our federal income taxes came from Natural News, actually: In reality, the government doesnt need any tax dollars to fund anything! The entire false narrative that assumes wage earners and business owners have to send money to Washington to pay for roads, bridges and schools is absolute hogwash. Out of the entire federal budget, the vast majority of the money actually goes to paying entitlement benefits (social security, Medicare, unemployement, etc.). See the spending charts here. Only a tiny fraction of government spending goes to roads, highways and bridges, and most of the money directed toward education ends up as salaries and grants, not building schools for children. The idea that, by taking legally allowed deductions on huge losses, somehow Donald Trump has deprived America of schools and roads isnt just absurd; its the height of financial illiteracy. Not only that, the question really should be asked why the doggone tax code is so complicated in the first place. So complicated, in fact, that an entire industry has popped up around it. (Yes, I just answered my own question.) Whoever was in charge when the darn system was set up (hint: NOT conservatives) put it together to benefit SOMEONE, and some group of people. Why is there a problem when Americans take advantage of the system the way it was set up? Oh, thats right. Because RICH people are expected to carry more of the burden even when they employ the very sorts of people maligning them and pay their payroll taxes. (Another aspect of taxation in the US that inspired an industry. Ever try to do a payroll by hand and then record it in accounting software?) Well, hate to tell the liberals this, but across the board, Trump supporters really dont care. In fact most of us get that releasing the document was a breach of journalism ethics. The real problem liberals have is with the law since so many people out there take advantage of the loopholes. (Mark Zuckerberg, George Soros, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett do the libs think these people pay a dime more in taxes than they have to?) If thats the problem, then ask lawmakers to close the loopholes. Considering the far worse bombshells in Hillary Clintons financial closet, why Trump is being persecuted for following the law smacks of envy. Not class envy. Plain old greed envy. Les Deplorables get that. "
0,"19 Year Old Girl Shields Police from Violent Protesters, and Her Brave Message is Going VIRAL! America is experiencing the worst case of Deja vu with these Ferguson protests, and it seems like everyone is attacking police for doing their jobs. But one young lady is showing pure class and DEFENDING the police from the unruly mob. 19 year old Lexi Kozhevsky is setting the internet ablaze for her efforts to protect police.St Louis Post-Dispatchs director of photography, quoted her as saying: I would rather get hit by something than let it hit them. In a snap chat message, the young girl says, Look guys, discrimination is a thing and I get it but we need to stay with the people who protect us and thats what Im doing. I want to protect my police. Lexi is aSt. Louis University nursing student and she told the Blaze just how she felt being out there alone. It was scary. People were looking at me and making gestures. It was unnerving, to say the least. But sometimes you just have to stand your ground. And stand her ground she did, even when water bottles were being thrown at her face.They threw a water bottle and it was pretty scary because you dont know whats being thrown at you,Kozhevsky said. Lexi uses common sense, something that is lacking in this movement. She said,I dont think all cops are evil based on a few incidents. Lexi realizes just how grateful we should be for the work police officers do.Not all cops are bad, she said. And thats just what upsets me. When I call someone if someone robs me, I call the police. They are there to help us. This young lady understands that the actions of these protesters are counterproductive. Thats not the way to make progress, she says. Reach out to government officials, start petitions, make a change, she said. But dont be violent. It hurts the community more than anything. We all know she will probably get death threats and be called racist for her inspiring actions. These protesters work hard to shut down events, but they rage against anyone who tries to shut down violence. But if this girl was brave enough to step in front of police and face a mob of hateful animals, something tells me she can handle her own. "
0,"It Started With This Family Of Traitors? Who Are The Clintons... Many have heard the saying keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Hillary Clinton has brought that to a whole new level. She stated we need to respect our enemy. Perhaps its because she has established friendships with the enemy. Dr. Saleha Abedin is one of the leaders of the Muslim Sisterhood. Her daughter Huma is Hillary Clintons former Chief of Staff and a close family acquaintance. The Muslim Brotherhood and Sisterhood are no friend of ours and neither are the Clintons. Hillary has kept our enemies close, and now she is calling for us to respect them. She has expressed no respect to the families of our fallen in Benghazi. Did she show respect for Ambassador Stevens when he begged for our help. If you want respect you have to give it. I hold no respect for our enemy and even less for the traitors who protect them. I hold no respect for anyone who thinks its ok to force marriage on little girls or chop the heads off newborn kids. I have lost all respect for those who turn their backs on Americans while kissing the ass of those who detest us. If she respects them so much she should go live with them. Treason is the highest of crimes a person can commit. Its time for the traitors in Washington to go to prison. They need to disappear like the respect I will never have for them. God bless each of you, and may He forever this country Semper Fi, Shep The quasi state which you call Israel is a state which was theirs centuries ago, and Jews did still live in the 1948 Israel. Palestinians are a name and a group that came about in 1948 if there is a quasi it is the name Palestinian. In part, it wasnt just a return of the land to the Jews, Britain who had been the colonial presence in Palestine was about to leave and so it was to balance the power in the Arab world, fear that the Soviet Union would end up controlling the Mid East Oil. As for randomly starting to hate us you need to do some historical perspective on Muslim nations on the world we had altercations and discord with them from the time this country was founded read letters by both Ambassadors to Britain and France (Thomas Jefferson and John Adams) which show the inability to negotiate with Muslims. The Muslims have never gotten along peacefully with ANY religion in this world. As for their claim to peace the Quran, written by one man, starts off peacefully but states that the later directives in the Quran if in conflict with the earlier teachings the latter are to be followed and that ONLY Sharia law is to be followed. What we call radical islamicists are in fact, merely following the teachings of their religion and that moderate muslims are in violation of their own religion and subject to violent death. This, by the way, is why the radical Muslims justify the killing of their own religious members, as those people are in fact, not practicing the religion as it is present in the Quran. To give you a bottom line um asking a simple question of these people is, they have made themselves enemies and they are completely aware that they have. The Crusades in fact began because the Muslims refused to allow pilgrimages by Christians to the HolyLand and beheaded, raped and pillaged anyone who attempted to make the pilgrimage. So now I ask you, why would we not assume that they are the enemy. We did not force them to declare a Jihad or to attempt to create a Caliphate in order to rule the world. The Arabs had what is now called Israel centuries ago, did that keep them from attacking other religions? As the Hindis in India. They have a longer history of interference with the rest of the world. The reason they picked us is because they intend to rule the world, we were (perhaps not so much anymore cuz of Obamas lame leadership) the leaders of the Western World, so we are an obvious target. Do you really thing all of this is because of Israel that is nave. Wait a minute is that so different than Sun Tzu? What you folks are terrified of is people asking a simple question of why they are supposed to be an enemy. You all need for us to believe that they just randomly started to hate us for no reason at all just picked us on the map. That falls apart upon any examination. The US has a long history of interference with them even before the creation of the UN quasi-state Israel which the US has backed and further alienated the region. Regular American folk dont benefit from this arrangement only the elites do. "

Project Veritas did some of their usual great hidden camera investigative reporting, with Hillary Clinton campaign workers, engaged in voter registration. They reveal a bias against registering Republicans, which is not surprising, on the part of the Democrats. They arent supposed to destroy the registration forms, though. At the first part of the video a worker identified as Mark Hodges, a Hillary Clinton field organizer, describes bolting when he encountered what he took to be a Trump supporter. He headed for the other side of the parking lot, avoided contact and having to register the enemy. Trevor Lafauci is a campaign coordinator for the Clinton campaign. He explains that those who want to register as Democrats are offered the opportunity to vote by mail. If they want to register as Republicans, the offer is not made. Voting by mail is just too easy and extending that same opportunity would have the effect of eliminating a Democrat advantage. Why would they fight voter ID laws tooth and nail and then not utilize them to commit voter fraud? A Project Veritas reporter told Mr. Lafauci that he had ripped up three Republican voter registration forms or ballots, and asked if he would get in trouble for doing it. He was reassured by Mr. Lafauci that he would not get in trouble and that it would not be reported to anyone. He thanked him for being conscientious enough to report it to him. He makes his small talk and excuses for effect and then asks Lafauci one last time if hes cool with it. Lafauci says that he is, as long as the reporter doesnt make a habit of it. That was the pretext upon which the confrontation was based later, with a Project Veritas reporter coming in an asking Lafauci about that very incident. The report asks, I was just wondering, is the Hillary campaign staff okay with ripping up voter registrations for Republicans? He plays dumb, saying, Im not sure what youre talking about. Hes reminded of the earlier conversation with a Project Veritas reporter named Max, whom he denies knowing. The reporter asks how he respond to video if he had it in his possession with Lafauci talking to Max and telling him its okay to rip up Republican ballots and that he wouldnt be reported, asking him if he doesnt want to comment on that. As he reminds him of the comment about not making a habit out of it, the second bolt of the video is engaged in, as he heads for the parking lot and the safety of his vehicle.

Its about laying the foundation for Obamas dictatorial actions which are soon to follow. He wants to be able to say that he was left with no alternative. Hes also painting his Republican opposition as the villains who are forcing him to act in the interest of, not the citizens, but the people, the illegal alien people. Obama bemoans that the only hold out standing in the way of change for tens of millions of Americans are some Republicans in Congress. Once again hes deliberately confusing change with change for the better. We should all thank God for those hold-out Republicans. He encourages Republicans to get on board, saying, If youre mad at me for helping people on my own, then why dont you join me and well do it together. Obama knows that Republicans arent mad at him for helping people, they may not be mad at him at all. They dont support a conversion of our republic into a socialist state and we are fortunate for every ounce of resistance that they are providing. Hes happy to share the credit. Credit isnt the right word, responsibility or blame fits better. He asks Republicans to join hands with him and then follows it up immediately with, They dont do anything, except block me, and call me names. He then adds, And it cant be that much fun. Itd be so much more fun if they said you know what, lets do something together. Aside from the vacations, the dinners, galas and golfing, being president isnt supposed to be fun.

0,"Johnson, Kerry and Obama Pitching The Plan Nobody But Them And Soros Want Its interesting that George Soros would go to all of the trouble and risk of a written document with instructions for Hussein Obama rather than simply pulling on the appropriate string, but thats what he did. Hacks obtained by the group DC Leaks revealed a letter was sent to Obama by Soros with a request for him to increase the importation levels from 70,000 per year to 100,000. Thats exactly what happened, with Jihadi Jeh Johnson at DHS and Secretary of State John Kerry both acting as regime cheerleaders in promoting the anti-American project. The hacked documents also referenced a 69-page report titled, Open Society report on the agenda of an Open Society U.S. Programs board meeting held in New York from October 1 to October 2, 2015. Itemizing the objectives, the memo stated, Working in close coordination with our colleagues in the DC Advocacy office, we (in support of George Soros) have pushed for three specific policy objectives: (1) an increase in the worldwide refugee authorization from the pre-existing 70,000 to one commensurate with the need, (2) an increase in resources to the relevant government agencies to expand their ability to process individuals under the existing numbers (noting that the United States has only processed 1,500 Syrians since 2011 even though existing authority allows 10,000 as of now), and (3) an increase in the financing for efforts overseas, recognizing that the United States is and remains the largest funder of support for these efforts. Both of the second items on the wish list were implemented as well. The regime announced it had successfully imported 5,000 terrorist interns, what they like to label as Syrian refugees into the country as of June 30th, with Jihadi Jeh Johnson announcing that another 5,000 will be processed and brought in within the next 90 days. That pace is a 20,000 per year rate, but Johnson is confident that they will be able to expand beyond that. The number of facilities for processing in the Middle East was increased, with new offices opened in Iraq and Lebanon in the mad rush to flood America and change the nature of our country. The amount of money being thrown into our destruction has increased as well. Of course we could believe that this is all coincidental, that it is because Hussein Obama and George Soros share the same world vision for one world in which America is no longer exceptional and we, like every other nation, are ruled by their elite cabal. Obama is in office because Soros and other elites put him there. They may share the same goals and Obama surely shares in some of Georges money, they also share power and control over the United States. That is no coincidence and more and more the leaks of damaging information are proving what was previously dismissed by the media and other cover operations as conspiracy theories were actually true. Now if we can only get a few million sheep to snap out of their trance and pay attention, we may be able to save this country. "

Im tired of these losers thinking that its okay to be racist just because they are black. YOUR black life does not matter any more or any less than my white one. This video just shows you how ridiculous this racist behavior has become. At a black lives matter rally at Cleveland University,Brandon Blackwell a white reporter for Northeast Ohio Media group was harassed simply because he was white. The protest begins with one of the leaders asking all white people to leave. They claim the circle is only for black people. Could you imagine if a group of white people told all black people to leave? Blackwell explained that he was a reporter and it was public property. He continued to record while protesters blocked his camera with signs. After the secret circle message was given to only those of African decent, a womanRosa Clemente,tried explaining to Blackwell why she did not want him video taping. It actually made me laugh out loud when I heard her lame excuse. Clemente claims the CHILDREN are the reason why he shouldnt record. You mean the innocent children that you brought to a political, hateful and racist protest? THOSE children? The damage being done to those children has nothing to do with a camera. Those children are being mentally ABUSED by the irresponsible parents who brought them to such a disgusting event. Of course Clemente was wearing anI support Assata T-shirt. Assata Shakur assassinated New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973 and then fled to Cuba. Nothing like idolizing cowards who murder police right? Great message for the children youre so suddenly concerned about. She goes on to complain about kids being murdered by white police, but of course says nothing about the THOUSANDS of children killed in drive by shootings. Blackwell is then physically assaulted by a group of black people who keep grabbing his camera. When Blackwell tells them to stop, one activist says I got 800 black people behind me, what are you going to do? Another bimbo says that he is recording because of white privilege. I have had enough of people like this, and because of white guilt, we have let it get out of control. Do they think they are helping their argument by acting like racist thugs? Police kill 3 times more white people than black people, and 99.9% of arrests last year did not end in the suspect being physically harmed. Their whole movement is based on lies. If they want police to stop profiling them they need to change the behavior that gets them profiled! Quit breaking the law and respect police when they confront you! Its so simple, but intellectually lazy people like this woman will never get it. She would rather blame white people for her failures and the failures of her community. The worse part is, the children will follow in her racist footsteps. If you have trouble viewing the video, it can also be seen HERE "

This writers colleagues (all men. They would not let the girls do it) would open all the doors, put the gas masks with canned oxygen over their heads, get the wrenches out and make the switch. Twice when accidents did happen, lifeguards ended up in the hospital and the pool was closed for the day while the pump building was aired out. Chlorine gas is downright deadly. Its also cheap. Which may be why ISIS, the ISLAMIC State Caliphate people, are packing it into roadside bombs. Thanks to the BBC, now the west knows how nasty these ISIS dudes are if they are subjecting their victims to chlorine gas even if the goal is to scare people moreso than killing them. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. I would venture to say that this isnt the last we are going to hear of ISIS/ISIL obtaining and using WMDs which,btw,arent supposed to exist in Iraq,are they now? "
0,"Top Obama Bundler Arrested For Child Rape And Sodomy, Media Stays Silent Prominent Democrat Terrence P. Bean has been indicted for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy with his boyfriend in a hotel room. He was arrested at his home in southwest Portland on Wednesday and charged with two counts of third-degree sodomy and one count of third-degree sex abuse. Portland police tracked down the 15-year-old boy whose testimony helped lead to the sex abuse indictment against Bean and his former boyfriend, Kiah L. Lawson. Bean and Lawson allegedly set up an encounter with the teen through the iPhone app Grindr. The popular app is a mobile social network that helps gay men find other local gay men or just curious men, for dating. The app advertises, Meet the men nearest you with GPS. According to court records, Lane County Circuit Judge Curtis R. Conover ordered Lawson not to disclose the name of the victim in the case. Bean was bailed out on Wednesday by paying ten percent of his $50,000 bond. Lawson is being held on $50,000 bail as well, he is due back in court Jan. 5. Well lets see. When someone is given a get out of jail free card it is hard to say what a person would do. Look at Sharpton. He owes over $4 million in back taxes and he still gets to run around free. Sharpton hangs out with Obama who keeps inviting him back again and again. But of course that is not Obamas fault for being an enabler now is it Indications are that Bean and Obama are butt buddies. I wonder if the pretender Obama has been recording his encounters while in the white house? It isnt clear if Bean or Lawson knew that the boy was under age. He helped to form the Human Rights Campaign and the Gay And Lesbian Victory Fund. These two need to be in prison!!! Sdom Hussein Obama, the gaytheists and fgnostics of Al Queerda, are no different than the hijab wearing duche bags. How sweet, gay buddies.. So, is it Obamas fault this guy is a rapist??HMMMMMM Please impeach Obama and get him out of our country. He stands for everything that is wrong with this country. Jilted lover statutory rape??? Just the right political story??? But in the end another democratic fund raiser going bad!!! But he was a good boy turning his life around and he was just helping him. Scumbags. Through them under the jail. How awful. Child rape, statutory rape, and plethora of charges. Rot in hell. "
0,"Roger Stone - Inside Info, Trump Is Right To Raise Cruz - Oswald Questions Roger Stone notes that the first response by the media to someone blurting out the truth is to immediately go out and label them derisively as a conspiracy theorist. Anyone who believes that the evil that is taking place behind the scenes and increasingly in view is happening through a collection of random acts should have their head examined. These are obviously coordinated and coordination happens by way of conspiracy. On the topic of the mention of the photos of RafaelCruz with Lee Harvey Oswald, Stone says, Even though I think its somewhat extraneous, lets address this. I had an email last night from Judyth Vary Baker, shes a friend. Shes also indisputably was Lee Harvey Oswalds girlfriend from 1961 to 1963. She knew Rafael Cruz well. She confirms that he was part of Lee Harvey Oswalds crew.He adds, Also, if one will simply do a computer analysis of the facial aspects in the photo, which yes, appeared in the National Enquirer, but was released by the Warren Commission, with a current photo of Rafael Cruz, its a perfect match. Jones points out that George H.W. Bush was reportedly involved in quarterbacking the New Orleans CIA operation, so its only natural that Ted would be working for the Bush clan. The reason, according to Stone, that Trump raised the point on national television is because he was attacked by Cruzs dad, the man who appears in the photo with Oswald. Stone says Trump is fearless and if you attack him, Prepare to get smashed back in the teeth. Thats the way he fights, hes a brawler. This is not a guy who turns the other cheek. Regarding comments Cruz made the previous day that Trump was a kook, a philanderer and a pathological liar, Stone says, Let me get this straight. The guy who claimed that his wife cashed in her retirement at Goldman Sachs to finance his Senate campaign, and it later turns out that none of that happened, in fact they took a million dollar secret sweetheart loan from Goldman Sachs, hes calling Trump a pathological liar? Oswald is believed to have been in New Orleans doing pro-Castro propaganda work for the group the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Rafael Cruz has admitted and even bragged about his murky Cuban activism history, so its no stretch of the imagination for his talents to have been recognized by communist organizations. Was the message that was sent by Trump mentioning Rafaels involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald the signal to Cruz that more was on the way and what convinced him to end his run and if so, what more is this Canadian whos hiding his documents hiding from us? Does anyone in Texas want to take a look at Cruzs history and his connections to Dallas? Photo is believed to be Rafael Cruz with Lee Harvey Oswald from early 1960s in New Orleans.

0,"Heartless Bill Clinton Mocks The Coal People He, His Wife And Obama Are Destroying Lately it seems the more the Clintons open their mouths the more reasons they give us to despise them. That is true of both the rapist former president as well as his protector and presidential hopeful wife. This time it was globalist Bill Clinton who couldnt help but show the world what a true ass he is. Heres a guy who gets paid more than half a million dollars to stand in front of a group of people and talk for twenty minutes in exchange for his wife selling out our country, who has the nerve to denigrate hard-working Americans who have had their lives stolen out from under them by Democrat corruption. It is the Democrats who are killing coal. It was Obama who made that pledge before being elected the first time in 2008, when he told the San Francisco Chronicle, So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can; its just that it will bankrupt them, because theyre going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas thats being emitted. Along with the loss of those coal operations went thousands of miner jobs, just as Obama promised. We all know that Clinton represents a continuation of the disaster quo, four more years of the American bleed out. Hillary infamously and matter-of-factly admitted in March of this year, We are going to put a lot of coal miners coal companies out of business. Those are families whose lives have been turned upside down, who are financially destroyed and now dependent upon the social safety nets for their survival. There is no justification for what is happening to them other than the fairy tale of global warming and the financial rewards some callous and very corrupt politicians will realize from forcing America in that direction. Bill and Hillary Clinton are two of those most contemptible political parasites. Predator Bill talks of how well Donald Trump has done in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky because the coal people dont like any of us anymore. They all voted for me, Clinton says, as he gestures in an oddly feminine manner. I won twice and they did well. He then goes on to mock them as irrational, foolish people who blame the president when the sun doesnt come up in the morning now. Of course if the sun didnt come up in the morning the lack of a job might be low on the list of concerns, but aside from that, its everything. They didnt suddenly wake up in the morning, note that the sun is where its supposed to be, and start hating the thieving Clintons and Obama. They were attacked by the Democrats who have earned every bit of the hatred being directed their way. The arrogant lack of empathy and total disregard for the negative impacts their globalist profiteering is having on the good people of this nation is breathtaking. These coal people have real coal children to feed and real mortgages on their coal houses that will be unpaid. Some of them will be living on the coal streets or in shelters. Clinton might think its funny or cute to mock the lives that are being ruined by him and his wife. Nobody outside of their little syndicate does. Part of the reason those coal people hate the Clintons "
0,"[Watch] Judge Jeanine - Obamas Bloody Hands, Illegal Alien Murderer Released Into U.S. Kills American Judge Jeanine Pirro reminds us that sooner or later the truth comes out. She says the immigration crisis on the southern border is more about Barack Obama than a humanitarian crisis. Of course we knew that but shes making a point. She talks of the difference between the perception and the reality of the situation, that many of those seeking amnesty arent babies, they arent even children, and has a 43 example that she shares with us. Pedro Alberto Monterroso-Nava crossed along with a group of children from Honduras, voluntarily turned himself in, was processed and released. Today hes under arrest for murdering a 24 year-old Louisiana woman. Judge Jeanine comments how our current worst president ever is walking in the footsteps of his predecessor in that distinction, Jimmy Carter in allowing anyone with a foreign accent and a criminal background the benefit of the doubt and a clean slate in America. The Obama regime has known the invasion was coming for at least two years, according to Judge Pirro. They ought to know, they created it. And they tried to cover it up.

0,"[Watch] Illegal School Kids Cost to Communities, More Govt-Forced Wealth Redistribution Cavuto and Moore claim the number is fifty thousand illegal alien children which will be descending like locusts upon our school systems within the next couple of weeks. Virtually every single one of them will be non-English speaking, requiring extra attention, and receiving financial support from the local community as well as the federal government. The numbers calculated by Stephen Moore relate specifically to the education costs and surely understate the overall financial impact. Vaccinations, for example, wont be part of the cost of education, but they will be required and they will be given for free, under some type of Obama, DHS or HHS mandate. Moore calculates the cost of education alone at over a billion dollars this year, with that fifty thousand number being one provided by U.S. government projections. Those numbers may well be much higher, given the inability of the American people to force a rogue administration to obey and enforce our immigration laws. That billion dollars is spread across the nation and the claim is that the federal government will be reimbursing the local communities for their costs, just as they pay up to $6,000 per household to warehouse the kids now. The fact that we pub a federal label on the wasted tax dollars doesnt make it any more responsible or any less offensive. Money being wasted on supporting border-crashers from other countries, whether it be state, local or a federal reimbursement is still money that is being taken away from legitimate needs of the American people and thrown at an unnecessary crisis of Obamas creation. Moore describes the people in most of these communities as accepting people who cant afford it. He inadvertently hit the nail on the head. The fact that so many people will go along with their criminal government and just accept what is dictated to them is exactly why we are in this mess. Previous generations, composed of a more patriotic, less apathetic and less socialistic citizenry would never have stood idly by as this type of madness was unleashed upon them. Americans need to be less accepting and more demanding of a government that is working day and night to destroy them and convert the previous understood exceptionalism associated with being an American into no different, no better than any other socialist nation.

0,"Islamists Give Americans A GREAT Reason To Vote For Donald Trump - WATCH Sometimes the people forget that the internet, like a diamond, is forever. Earlier this year, an Islamist propaganda video was combined with some rhetoric about the base truths that Donald Trump speaks and so many do not want to hear. The result was a video that in and of itself is going viral a couple months later. In it, the people of Michigan, specifically Islamists who live there in community in the Detroit metro region, have a message for America if we elect Donald Trump. Just the first two or three minutes will be enough. (The whole thing degenerates after that.) The followers of Islam and those desiring the enshrining of Sharia Law in the United States (that ploy was struck down in court recently) are hellbent on using our own laws against us. Specifically the first amendment and the freedom of speech and of the press and the free exercise of religion. So long as any or all of these rights do not impact the rights of everyone else, anyone can participate in American life without a problem. However, when that line is crossed, which muslims do on a regular basis in an in your face bullying so they get their way manner, that is when we Americans have a problem. That is what is happening in Michigan, and that is why it is vital Americans take the Islamists at their word: they are willing to leave if Donald Trump is elected president. And we thought getting rid of Barbra Streisand was a bonus. (Highly overrated vocalist, and obnoxious brat to boot.) Whether or not this actually comes to pass is another matter. As for living peacefully side by sidefor over 200 years, before immigration from Islamic lands was a significant percentage of those coming to live here, we did just fine aside from the more rowdy of the shanty-town inhabitants. Funny how that changed when the followers of Islam started to move in. "
0,"Cruz/Fiorina - Snarly Carly Joins Sleazy Ted - Prove Two Is Less Than One Is it correct to label someone as your running mate if they are joining your campaign simply to take part in its last stand? Wouldnt that by definition make them more of a standing mate or perhaps a human shield? Ted Cruzs last-ditch announcement that hes made a choice as to who hell tap for his never-to- be Vice President is like everything else he does, calculated and manipulative. Hes flailing desperately, aware that his Waterloo is not in Iowa and his Alamo is not in Texas. Little Big Horn Dog Cruz is facing elimination from what is now the GOP final four in Indiana. Cruzs customary speaking engagements are always laced with an incessant, painful flow of overly dramatic preacher-pauses. Theyre intended to lend sermon-like credibility to his content composed of half truths and lies. Now hell have schoolmarm Carly at his side, ready to keep the squirmy attendees in their places, ruler at the ready and not afraid to use it. Cruz had to make the announcement now, every hour he delayed put him that much closer to going back to work as Texas Canadian Senator and he couldnt choose even more unpopular Rick Perry, theyre both from Texas and theres that gender thing. Cruz wouldnt womanize or visit DC madams, he respects women; hes got one as his running mate to prove it. Is Cruz going for the Indiana sympathy vote? Voting for this pair is a lot like donating to charity. It hurts a little at the time but you feel good afterwards, knowing that you helped some poor, pathetic individual. Just looking at them side by side reminds you its time to get rid of those old laceless, unmatched shoes from the bottom of your closet. As Cruz said in Knightsville, theres nothing Hoosiers cant do, and potentially salvaging his campaign will be proof of that. Dark sunglasses, cotton balls for the ears and blind acceptance of nonstop lies as truth can make a Cruz/Fiorina supporter out of any Indianan; at least they hope it can. When the going gets tough, Cruz has called on Fiorina in the past. She came to his aid as the front line of defense when a Mail Online reporter asked Cruz to state for the record that he had been faithful to Heidi, which he steadfastly refused to do. Following a redefinition of the word faithful or just the right choice of word-parsing verbiage, and perhaps a conversation with Bill Clinton, Cruz found the meaning of is and reversed himself. He defended himself with newly discovered indignation to Megyn Kelly at a Fox town hall. All indications are that Fiorina is an actual American citizen, but if Ted Cruz is doing the vetting and hes established himself as the standard, it might be a good idea to double check and make sure that her birthplace isnt listed as n/a, close enough, or at this point what difference does it make, something that would be more Cruz-friendly. Shed better be prepared to name her own Vice President choice if shes able to help Ted salvage his campaign, because the Democrats wont be so willing to overlook Canadian citizenship as they were whatever Obama is and neither will the patriotic Americans opposed to foreign control. Theres also the matter of the transfer of $500K from a Cruz Super PAC to Fiorinas back in June of last year. Is this some sort of pay back or perhaps intended to clutter any investigation at to the reasons behind the unusual pooling of funds? Is this his way of saying hes had his eye on Fiorina all along? Will he then go ahead and admit hes been controlling the actions of his Super PACs all along and the money transfer was just part of the program?

0,"WATCH Hillary Clintons Fixer On Hannity Have you seen the National Enquirer today? Me neither. At least not yet. But the cover story for the day is all about a man who, over the years, has been a fixer for the Clintons, a writer for the National Enquirer, and, it turns out a ghost writer for Tom Clancy. His name is Jeff Rovin, and on Tuesday night, he went public on Sean Hannitys prime time Fox News show to explain a few things. First off, Rovin does not like the term fixer. Thats not really what he saw himself doing. As far as he was concerned, his job was to keep certain sources names out of the headlines. Actors, actresses, limo drivers, food servers, maids, and more made up the network of informants. As far as this man was concerned, they were not the guilty parties. They do not deserve to be exposed as the rocks are lifted off of the underbelly of Americas political class. Rovin also has the curious distinction of being one of the few people to say outright that politics and political reporting as we know it is a sordid business. He claims that currently, the world of journalism is turned on its head: the National Enquirer is acting the part of the New York Times and vice versa. Not only that, but the National Enquirer vets its stories well beyond what the mainstream media does. During this interview, Sean Hannity is his usual self, and most viewers want to take him by the lapels and say, LET THE MAN ANSWER! However, the information that Rovin provides and the web of people at the top of the food chain who know each others secrets and keep their mouths shut in public is most curious. Enjoy. Must be nice to be that libertarian about sex, but thats sort of the way things have been in the corridors of power both here and elsewhere since the beginning of civilization. And being able to separate personal feeling from workthats another matter. In one way, it is refreshing to know that there are people in the American journalism field who do recognize the hypocrisy and ironies for what they are. Mr. Rovin is one of them. Too bad this distance, on the surface at least, gives tacit approval to the immoral nature of the subjects involved. "
0,"Transgender Female Shot To Death in Department Store After Following Woman into Restroom 39 year old Donna Wright (born Donald Wright) was shot to death in aBradfords Department store in Colorado this weekend. The incident happened when Wright, who was dressed as a woman, attempted to use the womens bathroom. A fellow shopper,55-year old Kathleen Workman, politely asked Wright to use the Mens room, since Wright was visibly a man. This allegedly angered Wright and she became combative while following Workman into the womens restroom. Workman says that Wright lost control and became using explicit language while continuing to follow her into the restroom.While they were both in the restroom, Workman says that Wright started to display what Mrs. Workman considered aggressive body language along with the verbal assault. Workman said she became scared and she pulled her handgun from her purse, again asking Wright to leave. The sight of the gun allegedly enraged Wright, and thats when Wright charged at Workman. Fearing for her life, Workman fired three shots withher Kimber 1911 Ultra .45 caliber handgun in self defense.Donna Wright had stopped breathing and was pronounced dead upon arrival of emergency respondents. Since there were no cameras or witnesses, nocharges have been filed against Workman. Workman was licensed to carry a concealed weapon and the incident is being ruled as a shooting in self-defense, although an investigation is still pending. Bradford management team followed Targets lead last month and allowed transgender shoppers to use the restroom of the sex they identify with. They even posted a sign between the mens and womens restroom that reads: Unfortunately, I fear more and more incidents like this may occur as women are forced to share the restroom with the opposite sex. The I identify as excuse is a slippery slope and its only a matter of time before 50 year old men identify as a 16 year old teenager to sleep with underage girls. I mean, how far willwe letthis go?

0,"Final Lesson From The Cross!!! World To Celebrate His Love Returned!!! On April 4th,1977 my fourth grade teacher began to read the most powerful speech I have ever known. It had been 9 years since he took his last breath and I was learning to crawl. At Cedar Park Elementary in Selma, Alabama, Mrs. Craig Captured my attention with every word. I asked her if anyone believed we might get there one day. With pride in her eyes, she said it can only happen if one believes. With the glow of an angel she taught me the lesson of hope in a smile. I would go through life learning lessons from love in search of a dream. They say unless you touch something you will never understand how it feels. I was introduced to the pain of goodbye at sixteen when our friend Mario took a bullet so I could breathe. The lesson learned as hope leave the eyes and skin turns to grey. Our friend Kate Luna was the breaking news of Click2Houston October of 2000. While the city of Houston was out trying to find her, her boyfriend sought comfort during his interview on the News. A hard way for dad to know his little girl had left, and blood on knuckle we knew her last breath. God knew I needed comfort and Lisa was hope gliding as she danced. She was a single mother who worked all day, sometimes working two jobs. Her smile was brightest when talking about her children Jeff and Kate. She knew about my friend Kate but always believed in the good of people. With a smile she said without dreams you can never have hope leaving on a Tuesday, while cancer took another smile. The hate that murdered my friend Is the same that killed Dr. King. Skin color has never been the source of our problem and Dr. Vivian Thomas proved it. Thomas is the pioneer of open heart surgery who followed a dream. He grew up being told doctors with organs of different color have dreams come true. Without ever going to college Dr.Thomas knew skin color had nothing to do with troubles of the heart. Even blue babies leave with skin turned to grey. After proving it millions are saved because he taught others how to heal. Now one less color to blame and still need to adjust the pipes. November 10, 2010 was the day I gave up everything standing up for others at work. Not because they were black, but because of a managers ignorance in believing that leadership meant control. The lesson was watching others controlled with fear. Mary and three others worked at OXY with pride in themselves while I watched them robbed of hope as the fear of losing careers kept them from saying anything. This lesson is love for country now controlled with fear. Scratching the back of others will never take away your itch. We never learn without mistakes which is cause to learn. Never a mistake after the lesson is learned. He gives the love in which to handle never more. Not one can force you to love because you can not take what is given. Fear of his love keeps away comfort when love washes fear. I learned the lesson of losing my wife, family, and a career I love but this last class I would take alone. I forgave everyone who had hurt me. Jesus taught me to forgive which brought comfort I had never found. I put others before me, and began to love all others more than myself. I listened and learned from the greatest teacher ever known. After years of lessons my love is all of this world since the venom of the snake. The lesson of love given was being placed upon me. Satan has always used our greatest weakness as his favorite tool. I witnessed fear and pain in the eyes of my mother and wife as they cried out with worry. The more pain he caused with evil disguised as love, the more I loved and prayed for those who caused it. I prayed all day for those Satan was using and it was pissing him off. The forbidden fruit found the snake and and bite making us sick. Bad apples fall but can hide a snake in the grass. I will now burn in the lakes of Hell for eternity before I see anyone not able to swim. I learned of this love given known only to God, Heart filled and no room for hate, Jesus beside me this day had come. Satan brought this war on terror into my home, just like he has done since day one. He did it to the mother of Jesus while teaching how to treat a snake bite. The lesson of why we dont bring mother to the field, to see her son while at work. He used their love for me while trying to stop my love for others. He used greed, pain, corruption, and got schooled on what a Marine will do. We protect those around us and give every breath to do it. We love our brothers and watch over their mothers and children. Satan used my mothers pain trying to stop my love sworn to protect. Sworn in love on yellow footprints born in the blood with all He loves. This is not to be blamed on Oxy or anyone because everyone is the reason I believe. I now love everyone from the lesson because the venom of a snake is safe from no costume. He carried me with love when I was tired and His love gave me strength to crawl back home. This brings healing which provides strength in love. It is for the good of all people and harm can not touch what heals. Companies, politicians, religion, kids, athletes, no matter the costume, everyone of this world because God is the perfect love who loves all. Pain is never caused by comfort, because pain is washed by comfort in love. You dont bring a match to put out fire as matches cant wash away water. Satan caused pain in the eyes of my mother thinking I would bring pain upon those he used to cause it. Satan stuck out his tongue so I kissed his fear goodbye. This lesson was taught with fond memories as we talked about John. Dr.Thomas saved lives through teaching, and Jesus came with love not to harm but we focus on his death. Pain distracts classroom while teaching love and forgiveness. It was never meant to justify what caused it, but to heal the one who gives it. John wasnt told to dance with the spear but taught comfort in the bandage. After six years I began to get a little rest and allowed myself to play. I was able to share messages and gifts just to let His children know how much they mean each moment loved. I got to meet the cooks at IHOP across the street from a Cowboys dancehall in San Antonio. Spending time with those who are reason I got to eat. I got to meet Andrew the attendant and hear about his two little girls. Was blessed meeting Aleshia while smiling serving lunch at Hooters in Pasadena. Thanking our Father for her family the moment I was blessed to meet her. September 22, 2011 I sent the president a message to offer what heals this world. Phone ring is both ends but comfort follows 911. I give my love freely without condition to all who seek it. Not one is more important not one to blame but the reason we save ourselves. We are the world and reason He sent this love which saves us. Jesus the greatest teacher ever known gave his final lesson at 33 from the cross. Once taught by a man just 33 with a Dream on top of a hill. It was then but a dream given to a boy delivered in a smile. 33 years this day boy to a man, said goodbye childhood hello Marine before this lesson began. The joy and celebrations from all who came before land promised, We give this gift to our Father with a smile, lesson taught is now the lesson learned. God said if just one man, puts all others before himself. Since the beginning, we have treated the source of pain with what causes it. Titles create division, but never find comfort in hate. Leaders who seek comfort will seek this love which saves all of this world. The fear of pain will not stop whats hurting. Like a cut washed with love we heal to stop bleeding. Your mom is comfort by love in trusting pain go away, she doesnt grab the rock that cut you to take away the cut nor cast at another to take away the pain. Its the love given in the cloth with water she washes away the hurt. We are blaming the rock and never healing in the wound. We fear the water, allow the burn. We shall bring healing together with this perfect gift sent from our Fathers hand. He creates what heals so his children cry with fear no more. With His eternal love, sent down I say to each of You. This love I now carry Is the love promised for you. This day written, a boy from Selma once given a dream, from his teacher sent from a preacher on the hill. This man taught the love of all children as he learned from the greatest teacher ever known.This final lesson given to one that could handle only when God would know. I take this bath on Sunday to wash away thoughts of death and give thanks this Love shall live. I claim no title of religion because this gift is One for all If you lead then teach how to follow back this love returned forever #Marine4Truth, Shep "

The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Trump and Cruz, still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, says Judge Pirro, its now. At a time when more people than ever are invested and voting, you want to keep your status quo, the one where one hand washes the other and we pay for the soap. She goes on to discuss the indications by establishment insiders Karl Rove and Reince Priebus that they are going to do their best to ignore and cancel our votes. She plays a clip of Karl Rove on the Hugh Hewitt radio show in which he said, Donald Trump excites a lot of enthusiasm but he also excites a lot of anger within the Republican Party and outside of the Republican Party, and a fresh face might be the thing that could give us a chance to turn this election and win in November against Hillary. She mockingly says, You want a fresh face? Arent you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? She then points out, RNC chair Preibus refuses to say whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote getters, Trump or Cruz. He says the Republican nominee is going to be someone who is running. Judge Pirro asks, Now what does that tell you? That the party chair is not willing to say that the nominee will be one of the two top vote getters, the top two delegate winners? Instead he quotes Rule 40; that a candidate needs a majority of 8 states. She then whittles down the possible contenders that fit into the Priebus definition of who will be the nominee, coming up with John Kasich as the establishment GOP choice. That makes sense, hes open borders, open unfair and predatory trade against Americans, often accused of being more like a Democrat than a Republican. Hes perfect for the elites who need a puppet candidate in each party. Kasich is also being financed heavily by George Soros, another of the inconvenient truths that dont get any coverage in the liberal media. Judge Pirro notes that rule 42 identifies rules 26 thru 42 to be temporary in nature, changeable at any time, in any manner, without any redress and in order to benefit certain candidates and their sponsors. She says the RNC rules are teed up for the convention rigging. They can nullify whatever occurs before the convention and the 2012 rules that are now in place dont necessarily apply to this convention. The RNC and rules committee has the power to change the rules and theres no way to challenge the results, no opportunity to go to court. The fix is in. She blasts them for attempting to invalidate the votes of Americans who waited in line to exercise their right to vote and then arbitrarily nullifying it in favor of someone the elites feel will help them better exercise their power. She asks, Whatever happened to your vote matters? Judge Pirro adds, Not since the American revolution has the ruling class tried so hard and so blatantly to take away our vote. Speaking to the RNC elites she asks, Do you not recall when we dissolved the political ties that bound us to the monarchy, when they strayed from all ideals of equity and fairness? A primer to the establishment, we dont get our rights from government. Government derives its power from the consent of the governed. She adds, Honestly, I dont care what you think of our choice or whether you like our favorites or not. Like everyone else, I will not be a puppet on a string, so stop trying to pull our strings.

0,"Recent Violence From Hate Groups Will Change Police Tactics On Protests Now, after the shooting deaths of five officers at a Dallas protest decrying last weeks police killings of two more black men, some experts are suggesting its possible the pendulum could swing from hugs back to flash-bang grenades and mass arrests. After days of peaceful protests in St. Paul, officers in riot gear met protesters who blocked Interstate 94 late Saturday in the biggest confrontation between police and demonstrators since an officer fatally shot a black man during a suburban Twin Cities traffic stop last week. About 100 people were arrested half during the highway standoff and the other half early Sunday in another part of St. Paul. Twenty-one law enforcement officers were hurt during the protests, including six state troopers. Police Chief Todd Axtell called the pelting of officers with rocks, bottles, firecrackers and other objects a disgrace. Police used smoke bombs to clear the crowd of more than 200 people blocking the interstate. It was a contrast to their approach at protests outside the governors mansion in the wake of motorist Philando Castiles police shooting death Wednesday in the suburb of Falcon Heights. Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, has praised the calmer demonstrations outside his home and said he wont try to have people removed. Protests have broken out nationwide following the deaths of 32-year-old Castile and 37-year-old Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In Dallas, five police officers were killed and seven wounded when a gunman opened fire on a protest march Thursday. But most of the demonstrations havent been as tense as the scene in Dallas that night or the highway standoff in St. Paul. In Oakland, California, police ceded a highway to protesters last week and did not stop them from shutting it down. In Philadelphia, plainclothes officers have mingled with protest crowds. Even in Dallas before the shooting, officers mingled and posed for photos with people at the demonstration. I think officers are vigilant every time they put the badge on and the uniform on. I dont think its going to stop the officer from interacting with the men and women who are out there at a peaceful protest, said Sean Gormley, executive director of Law Enforcement Labor Services, Minnesotas largest police union. Craig Lally, president of the union representing Los Angeles police officers, said he suspects changes will be made at departments across the country when it comes to staffing protests and similar events. I think theyre going to have to be much more aware of their surroundings. The next march in Dallas, I guarantee theyre going to have sniper teams all along the march, cops with high-powered rifles, to see if anyone is going to be a copycat, Lally said. Which is truly a shame that it is has come to this! Former FBI agent James Wedick envisions departments having officers stake out high areas with binoculars and possibly sniper rifles, but keeping them out of sight to avoid causing panic. "
0,"White Couple Attacked by Thugs as Knock Out Game Trend Runs Wild, This is Where to Avoid Many think the racist black on white knock out game is a thing of the past, but they are wrong. The knock out game is still very real and its even increasing in some areas. If you live in the D.C area, avoid the D.C Metro! FOX 5 DC reported: Two more victims have come forward in another violent attack at a Metro station. It is the latest in a string of violent assaults happening in the transit system. I dont know exactly what was happening, said one of the victims. I heard my girlfriend screaming. It was 15 seconds of terror for a D.C. couple after they were attacked by a group of teenagers on Metro. I think there were about ten kids who were just all attacking us, said the girlfriend. It was 9:30 p.m. Saturday night on January 2. The couple was waiting for a train at the Metro Center stop after spending a night at the movies. They were sitting on a bench when he was sucker-punched from behind and suffered a loss of vision. It all happened very quickly, and then they were just hitting us both in the face and head, said the female victim. They said the attack was unprovoked. We literally said nothing to them, said the boyfriend. The male victim had two black swollen eyes, welts on his head and bruised wrists from shielding his face. His girlfriend was left bleeding with a split lip. This is the forth attack just this last month on white Metro passengers. These young men and women are not interested in robbing their victims, they are out for blood. The media wants to ignore these attacks but doing so just puts more innocent lives in danger. This racist hate crime game needs to stop and its up to us to speak out. "
0,"OBAMACARE: Did Marco Rubio REALLY Set Death Spiral In Motion Back on the homefront regarding chronic and pressing domestic issues not related to immigration and veterans affairs, theres this little thing called the Affordable Care Act, or as we Americans not so affectionately call it: ObamaCare It was supposed to solve all sorts of health insurance issues when it was ramrodded through Congress in 2010 before anyone knew what was in it. The Speaker at the time did say it had to be passed to find out. Well, here we are, a little past five years later, and the insurers, the people who pool all that protection and racket money from their victims, uh, customers that pays out when one goes to the doctor OR has a major medical event, are fleeing the state exchanges that were supposed to advertise affordable insurance like rats off of a sinking continent. Why? Most people are thinking that it was just the weight of the law finally calling TIMBER! on the pricing. But the truth is that the built in subsidies that would keep the exchanges going despite the high prices to consumers that werent going to be bought and essentially provide annual bailouts to the insurance companies AND the state exchanges for their participation were severely undercut by a rider put into place in a budget deal two years ago thanks to one Senator Marco Rubio. From The Hill: The angst in the industry centers on an obscure program in the healthcare law known as risk corridors that was designed to shield insurers against losses. Rubio in 2013 went on the warpath against the program, decrying it as a taxpayer bailout. He penned op-eds against it, testified about it as the star witness at a House Oversight Committee hearing and even made his case to top House Republicans including then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). There is a problem with the way [ObamaCare] exchanges are now designed that have not yet received the attention they deserve, but I promise youre going to be hearing a lot about it in the days to come, Rubio said in a Senate floor speech in early 2014. While Rubios attempt to scrap risk corridors altogether was unsuccessful, his push contributed to a policy rider that was inserted into a 1,603-page spending bill passed at the end of 2014. Under the provision, which is still in effect, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could no longer tap other accounts such as its overall appropriations or its Medicare funding to fund the risk corridors program. This year, the fed can pay thirteen cents per dollar lost. The co-ops which were billed as the affordable option could not afford to operate on that and closed. For people actually in the insurance business, that kind of reimbursement aint going to cut it. The risk corridors program cannot fund itself (or be budget-neutral), and because of that Rubio rider which says HHS cant cannibalize from other pots of money to prop up the exchanges, the federal government cannot guarantee to cover losses as the insurers incur them while we all are trying to navigate through the minefield of ObamaCare. The insurers are cutting those losses and getting out before any more damage can be done to their bottom lines. (A year early, but well take what we can get.) Ed Morrissey over at HotAir calls this spike to the heart of the hot air balloon of ObamaCare mundane, like a Monday detail. Maybe, but not every ship sinks due to hitting an iceberg, or running into a sea wall. Rubio is right: if ObamaCare was ever going to work, the risk corridors should not be needed. The fact that there were built in bail-outs to the system should be rather telling. So, did Rubios rider in the 2014 budget deal trigger the death spiral that the ObamaCare exchanges are now experiencing? It is an interesting question. But, more importantly, the death spirals are going to yield a choice for the American government and people, not necessarily in that order. Single payer, which is a socialist/Democratic wet dream, or scrap the whole thing and go with market forces including health savings accounts, catastrophic insurance options, and insurance pools for those who want them. And THAT right up there with choices for potentially open Supreme Court Justice slots should be one of the more important deciding factors for the people in the field of2016 Presidential candidates and the election. Not long after Rubios rider became law, Blue Cross Blue Shield warned (for reasons of self-interest, mainly) that the death spiral would force the government into a single-payer system. Much depends on what comes afterward, and who gets to make those decisions. A Republican Congress wont pass a single-payer system, but a Democratic president wont sign a repeal of ObamaCare. If the collapse begins in October 2016 with United and possibly other insurers parachuting out of the individual marketplaces, then a Republican president would be in good position to sign a repeal and would have a lot more likelihood of getting elected to boot. Otherwise, what might happen is that the system crashes, and nothing follows for several years while the taxes and the mandates still apply. If UnitedHealthCare actually exits the ObamaCare marketplace and the push is on to keep them in the fold thats most of the big boys opting out, and a collapse of the actual insurance aspect of the Affordable Care Act. All because the permanent bail-outs no longer can pull cash from just anywhere in the Health and Human Services budget. This episode in the American lefts century long ill-fated love affair with socialized medicine is not over yet, so, Rubio should hold off on the victory laps, but it was one battle won without anyone noticing until it was too late. He took a page out of the leftist handbook. For THAT, Senator Rubio deserves all the credit in the world. "
0,"ROADTRIP! Islamists Explain Why They Are Packed In A Van Driving The Length Of England Every now and then, the followers of Muhammad and Islam let the rest of us in on their plans. This week, they posted the evidence on Facebook. You see, Islam, far from being the sort of revealed religion that attracts followers due to the happiness and balance of the adherents, persuades newcomers with a sort of in your face evangelization that defies the golden rule of Christ, and, therefore, the west. Well, one group of Allahs men got in a van and traveled to Birmingham in England to convert the filthy heathen kafir (that would be us non-muslims). Check out what they had to say about their plans. So they are going to invite the people in Birmingham to be with them as they worship Allah and brush off lies about being Catholic. Note that the message is NOT one of peace, but of true Islam which is conversion at all costs. This is what so many people who study Islam day in and day out tell the world is the case, and so many world leaders deny for reasons that are unfathomable to the rest of us. In their determination to spread the word of Allah and gather converts, this group of relatively young, muslim men are essentially going on tour. Their tenacity is palpable and their will so far anyway to prevail in teaching the way of Islam no matter the consequences is tangible. After some significant time packed into a van that closely, it will be interesting to find out if the pilgrimage and recruiting efforts are ongoing. This is what we have to look forward to in the United States with the influx of migrants from muslim countries: evangelization efforts at every farmers market, craft fair, and open gathering of the masses. And we thought the Jehovahs Witnesses were bad. "
0,"(PICTURE) Bigfoot Couple Sighted in Pennsylvania John Stoneman and his girlfriend were driving home from a fall festival when they spotted something that has since made them famous. Stoneman believes the two Bigfoot creatures he captured on camera were attracted by the Bigfoot Calling Contest performed at the festival the day before. The couple said they were driving along a main road when Stoneman yelled at his girlfriend to slow down and frantically began snapping pictures of what she could only see as a dark spot in the woods. I said to my girlfriend, youre not going to believe the attention I am going to get from these shots, he related. When asked if he truly believed the creatures to be Bigfoot, Stoneman confessed, Im not trying to fake anything; Im 100% truthful. Im not saying they absolutely are Bigfoot, Im saying I took pictures of dark objects in the woods that I didnt know what they were. Adding that, Im still a skeptic, but I did see something. In answer to critics, Stoneman had this to say: This was not a bear and you can see fur on it. Its wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a man, like a Bigfoot. Stoneman undoubtedly has gotten quite a bit of attention from the pictures. So much attention that an anonymous tipper told HuffPost Weird News that the alleged Bigfoot couple is in fact a tree stump, claiming this sightingas just another scam. I thought it was Obama and Moochelle. "

Ive never written a book. I dont own any books that there is only one copy of? So what is my book? Oh, you are probably referring to the Bible or the Torah. Well first and foremost, just because someone is anti-Islam, and sees it for what it is, does not mean they follow any other type of organized religion. That is an ignorant assumption. Secondly, there is nothing in either the Bible or the Torah, or any other major organized religions Holy book that I know of that comes even remotely close to teaching its followers to do what the Quran instructs its followers to do. I have had this conversation many times, but if you want to step up and take your shot, then bring it on. I look forward to it. YOUR Book has most of the same stuff in it Well i agree Allah Akbar..and Carma is a Biatch Dan you are a bad person. And you should feel bad. You are pretty much saying. These humans that were taught different then me are shit Yes? Sorry youre narrow minded. Not every muslim is like that. All Muslims are evil. They follow and hold in high esteem a prophet that was a child rapist. That is evil. They follow a book that tells them to kill those who are not Muslim or dont covert. That is evil. In the Middle East there are no moderate or extremists Muslims. Those are words we in the West use to separate those who commit terrorism from those who dont or havent yet. In the M.E. they are all the same. I got news for you Joshua, if you are not a Muslim and dont want to convert, they hate you every bit as much as I hate them. I have an issue with anything that wants to kill me. If you dont then that is your problem. They dont care if you stick up for them, they will kill you. I can tell you about 4 recent examples of people who thought just because they defend Islam they wouldnt be killed. They lost their heads.

0,"AG Lynch Is Working With UN To Change Our Way of Life! Heres How... On Wednesday Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced at the United Nations that her office will be working in several American cities to form what she called the Strong Cities Network (SCN), a law enforcement initiative that would encompass the Globe. This amounts to nothing less than the overriding of American laws, up to and including the United States Constitution, in favor of United Nations laws that would henceforth be implemented in the United States itself without any consultation of Congress at all. The United Nations is a sharia-compliant world body, and Obama, speaking there just days ago, insisted that violent extremism is not exclusive to Islam (which it is). Obama is redefining jihad terror to include everyone but the jihadists. So will the UN, driven largely by the sharia-enforcing Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the pro-Islamic post-American President Obama, use a global police force to crush counter-jihad forces? To clear this up this police force is to be used for the biggest threat in America. That threat is not seen as Muslim extremism. It is not those that want to enforce sharia law in our country, or even those that are have been interviewed by the FBI and then shoot up a club killing and injuring multiple people. It is for us that see a Muslim invasion on American soil as a recipe for disaster. That know the terror attacks we have seen will only grow larger if we remain silent. That is according to the DOJ they want social cohesion meaning we need to shut our mouths as they do whatever they want as loudly or deadly as they want. Because after all that is their religion cult that allows them to behead, rape, torture, stone, and become martyrs for their so called religion. All while claiming we need to be tolerant to their feelings. Just exactly when should we stop being tolerant? When our whole city block is lined up to be executed because we wont convert, or because we wont allow our 10-year-old daughters to be child brides to these sadistic cowards that call themselves men. I have no tolerance for this false religion and I never will. I dont care how many police forces the government creates, what streets they patrol. Who they bring in or what they threaten me with. My rights are my rights, my beliefs are mine and those can not be taken from me. Whether I stand alone with my family I will stand against anyone that tries to tell me differently or take from me what isnt theirs. So Miss AG Lynch I am sure I am not the only one that feels this way. If you intend to take over the streets of America, Id prepare a better plan than thinking the UN is going to see that plan through.. Just a heads up on that one. Liberty2016 "

The All Lives Matter gorilla is bustin a move with his right leg extended and exposed. He had apparently gone to great lengths not to show his skin, it would ruin the effect. Folks will naturally assume its a white guy, a racist one at that. That appears to have been what a black racist in the costume was attempting to do. It seems his goal was to mislead black people into being angry at whites through fabricating what was immediately and roundly decried as a racist act. That hasnt been done on such a grand scale since Obama and Holder falsely cried racist and fomented national unrestat Ferguson. This time the venue was Obamas hometown of Chicago, at Soldier Field with the Bears hosting the Lions. The unnamed intruder was showing some leg that appeared to not belong to a white guy in the original photo. Additionally, those were some pretty fancy moves he put on the security officers and others as he evaded capture. He was the spitting image of OJ Simpson as he changed direction on a dime and burst away from his captors. OJ didnt evade all of his captors, as his current residence proves, but he was pretty good on the field. Mark Dice had the same doubts and he got the answers along with more evidence that puts the matter completely to rest.

More was revealed about Clintons lies to Americans and the families of the 4 heroes killed. Email evidence from a vital unnamed source prewarns Hillary to NOT use the video as the reason for attacks on the US Embassy consulate because that wouldnt be true. Oversea US Diplomats had warned Hillary and the State Dept. about blaming the attacks on an inflammatory internet video. The email warning came three days after the Sept. 11th attack and two days prior to Susan Rices, ( National Security Adviser)announcement on5 television networks.Ms. Rice had insisted and blamed the perverted video for causing the uproar at Benghazi. The written warning came from Tripoli, Libyas US Embassy. The name of sender was redacted. It states: The films not as explosive of an issue here as it appears to be in other countries in the region, the unknown sender wrote. And it is becoming increasingly clear that the series of events in Benghazi was much more terrorist attack than a protest, which escalated into violence. It is our opinion that in our messaging, we want to distinguish, not conflate, the events in other countries with this well planned attack by militant extremists. The messenger states that he got his sources from Libyan media, talking with residents and social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. A select committee spokesman named Matt Wolken said that serious concerns were raised by Clintons State Dept. and the Obama Administration at the time about whether to conflate the attacks with a video. This email shows that State Department staff privately raised serious concerns about conflating the terrorist attacks in Benghazi with a video, he said in a statement to Fox news, even as the secretary of state and other Obama administration officials continued to do so publicly. A former Intelligence analyst of the CIA never said anything about attacks being instigated by a video, Mr. Wolken argued. Turns out that this is just another smokescreen about Mrs. Clintons fog of war excuse made at the hearing. What does it take for this corrupt Administration to give Justice to the families of dead heroes and the American people. I am actually embarrassed that this President and Clinton think Americans are too damn stupid to actually let this lie. The truth will be revealed as time WILL tell. Source: Foxnews.com "
0,"[Watch] Brigitte Gabriel, Once a Human Shield Herself - Even Their Own Children are Expendable Brigitte Gabriel experienced firsthand the fear that accompanies being used as a human shield by Palestinians. As a child she and her family were used to protect a mobile rocket launcher which would move from house to house on her street, using the cover that the civilians provided as a defense in their attacks on Israel. She describes the Palestinians as having perfected using children to win the worlds sympathy. She describes one retaliatory strike by Israel in her neighborhood which wounded a woman and her two children. The evening news vilified Israel and showed video of the damage and injuries, with no mention of the provocations. She quotes the Lebanon television as saying Look how horrible the Israelis are, they are killing children. She says that since the Palestinians cannot win militarily against Israel, they use their own children as disposable collateral in order to win the war of public opinion against Israel. Gabriel describes the extensive efforts that the Israelis go to in order to minimize the loss of civilian life and asks why it is that none of the collateral damage and loss of life is attributed to errant Hamas rockets, a large number of which fall upon the civilians of Gaza as well. She says succinctly that Palestinians do not value the lives of their children and that they are willing to sacrifice their children in the cause of jihad.

0,"Dan Bongino, A Retired Secret Service Agent Has A Warning About Hillary And The White House! Former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino is interviewed regarding the information that is leaking out about the violations of protocol, both generally, diplomatically and in matters related to security by Hillary Clinton, particularly as it relates to the Secret Service. The conversation began with Martha MacCallum noting that there are now revelations that a former Secret Service agent of Bill Clintons worked as one of Hillary Clintons illegal bootleg server IT guys. Thats an interesting arrangement since he was certainly aware that what he was doing was illegal. He says that it is because of the threat that she poses that their Omerta, the code of silence is now not being observed to the degree it has been previously. He says, And this story about an agent being used to assist with Clinton Foundation server issues, security issues, which is totally against the rules for the Secret Service, Im pretty confident I know who the agent is, is totally unsurprising to me. And Ill bet theres a lot more there thats not being said, Im reasonably confident of that as well, based upon some stories Ive heard about what actually happened over there. They raise the issue revealed in released FBI documents, a complaint that Clinton would boot her security detail and diplomats she was meeting with from her limousine in order to make room for Huma Abedin. The report stated, This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol. It stated that one individual, whose name was redacted, explained, Clintons treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere. Dan Bongino points out that this is relative for several reasons, including the fact that it fits in with the larger narrative of Hillary Clinton. Her elitist snob attitude towards the military and towards her Secret Service agents, which was pretty pervasive during my time with her, it parlays into this elitist attitude towards government too that the rules dont apply to her. Mr. Bongino describes the incident that she just described as a major slap in the face. He elaborates, saying, They have a protocol chief in the State Department who strictly handles things like this. This is a major embarrassment on a foreign trip for her not to do this and to be seen separated in the motorcade from the leader of the country shes been invited to. But Martha again, Bongino reminds his host, shes an elitist, she acts like a snob, she treats people terribly, and she doesnt care about your feelings, or frankly, any protocol rules the government has. It doesnt matter. Its all about Mrs. Clinton all the time. She doesnt care. And she treated female agents terribly too, which I find ironic because she says theres a war on women, yeah there was a war on women in the Secret Service, she waged it. She was really terrible and I guarantee you there will be more people starting to talk about it. McCallum bails Clinton out, saying, Wow, strong charges across the board and I know that you have personal experience to back up your opinion, here. Hes asked about the feelings of agents about potentially having to protect her again. Bongino says, Martha, there are agents and uniformed division officers that are deathly afraid of this woman.

0,"[Listen] Hillarys Email: Morrell Reveals Possible Location Well, the server-gate saga just got interesting. Michael Morrell, the ex-CIA Deputy Director who has been busy digging a deep hole for himself when it comes to credibility of late, told Hugh Hewitt on Friday that he is quite certain foreign intelligence agencies the good ones, anyway have them. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. Well, that puts a new spin on things. Foreign governments have Hillary Clintons email from the time she was Secretary of State and our own government doesnt. And then theres the issue of judgement. Morrells judgement on his own affairs is one thing, but keeping email with classified documents on an unsecured server is another matter. Hackers were able to get into them. Why not foreign governments? As for paying the price, that one is still too early to call. H/T Politico "

ESPN has suspended the often outspokenCurt Schilling after he tweeted a statistic about Muslim extremists. The tweet went as follows It is said that only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists . . . In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. Howd that go? Almost instantly a firestorm erupted.ESPN removed Schilling from its Little League broadcast team following the tweet, saying in a statement it had removed the former hurler and implied that further action could be taken pending further consideration.Curts tweet was completely unacceptable, and in no way represents our companys perspective. ESPN wrote. Schilling later caved and tweeted that he accepts his suspension: I understand and accept my suspension. 100% my fault. Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part. So was his tweet politically correct? Okay no, but it does speak to a powerful issue that is too often ignored. Muslim extremism is a very dangerous subject. We are talking about a religion that has yet to seriously condemn the radical Islamists, even when they kill! We all know how evil the Ku Klux Klan is, butIslamic terrorists murder more people everyDAYthan the Ku Klux Klan has in the last 70 years! 30 out of the 32 criminals on the FBIs most wanted list are Muslim. The other two are left-wing liberal nut jobs, go figure. We shouldnt be afraid to point out statistics like this. This is a religion that KILLS people for being gay, yet no LGBT group will confront them. This is a religion that RAPES and MURDERS women for not properly obeying men, yet no feminist group will dare take them on. Why? Why are we so afraid to speak the truth when it comes to Islam? Are all Muslims terrorists? Of course not. As the religion of peace.com explains, "

0,"Brother Of Paris Suicide Bomber Employed In Belgiums Immigration Department Barbarians inside the gates, Trojan Horses, patient and plotting evilthese are not just sayings anymore or abstract warnings. After the terrorist attacks in Paris over the weekend, they are the stark reality we are living with and news uncovered by Trey Sanchez ofTruth Revolttells us just how perilous western civilizations survival may be: Mohamed Abdeslam is the brother of two of the terrorists that attacked Paris Friday night. They hail from Molenbeek, an impoverished immigrant district in Brussels known to be a jihadi hotbed. An ex-mayor of Molenbeek said up until the time Mohamed was arrested, he worked for the districts immigration department. In light of the current mass refugee influx in Europe suspected to be ushering in scores of ISIS militants, this is a most remarkable detail. Which, of course, begs the question that all conservative and anti-jihad bloggers are asking: just how many jihadists did this man let into Belgium? And given the open borders push in Europe, how many are now seeded in the rest of the continent? Since documentation on Islamist freedom to lie, cheat and steal by the tenants of the religion is not hard to come by, the concept that this Mohamed IS one of the barbarians guarding the gate itself is not hard to fathom. According to the Truth Revolt article, Mohamed and the rest of the family did not know what his brothers were up to, and furthermore, do not know where the brother who is at large is. That would be Salah who reportedly is back in Belgium. Ibrahim, the other brother, blew himself upoutside of the cafe Comptoir Voltaire in the vicinity of the Bataclan concert hall. As for why Ibrahim strapped himself into a suicide bombing vest, their mother has a theory. The mother said Ibrahim, the one in the suicide vest, may have been stressed and believes that the detonation was accidental. And 72 virgins waiting on the other side had nothing to do with it. Sure. Mohamed was released by Belgian authorities after his arrest as he has an alibi for November 13, the night of the attacks. But seriously, he WORKED FOR THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT! Wow. Just wow.

0,"Col West - Gadsden Flag Is Patriotism Not Racism There are more than just a few entitled BLM sympathizers working in the Postal Department and at least one who feels he has the right to force others to wear clothing that theyre both comfortable with. Hes probably a product of Americas education system too and largely ignorant of our history. The situation arose because one postal worker, the easily offended BLM type, determined that the Gadsden flag hat of another, obviously a patriotic American, was racist. The butt hurt BLM racist complained and now its gone to the EEOC. Lt Col Allen West shares his views on the situation. Greta Van Susteren asks if the flag is racist, to which Col West replies, Well I just will let you know that when you walk into my home in Dallas, TX, you will see the Gadsden Flag, I have a t-shirt that has the Gadsden Flag and when I go out motorcycle riding I have the Gadsden Flag on my motorcycle vest. And if you happen to notice, I am an American black man and I dont see any racism or racial harassment involved with the Gadsden Flag. West says, This is part of our history and this is part of those patriots that stood up to tyrannical government and said a very simple message, dont tread on me. And this comes from an administration, Greta, that cant even name the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. But yet they want to question on of the iconic and historic flags. And as a matter of fact, the United States Navy used to fly that Dont Tread on Me flag. West points out in the closing, Im sure there are a lot of police officers that really are offended by a Black Lives Matter t-shirt, but you dont see them going out and complaining, do you? Touch Col West. "
0,"Judge Jeanine Compares Reaction Of Candidates To Bombings And Media Manipulation Judge Jeanine Pirro gets the words used reversed but the facts are the same, Trump used the word bomb in comments immediately after the latest attacks in New York. Clinton, who appeared to actually be talking in her sleep, used the word bombing. The media went nuts about Trump and ignored, actually editing out the comments of Clinton. Judge Jeanine wants to know whats going on, and asks Trump campaign senior adviser Boris Epstein for his perspective. He says, Whats going on is the leftist media is in an absolute tailspin because her campaign is in a tailspin. Shes losing, you look at all the states. Donald Trump is up right now in three states that Barack Obama won in 08 and in 12. Hes up in Nevada, New Mexico and in Michigan, Donald Trump is, completely unexpected. Were up in Colorado, were up in Ohio. Look at all the key states right now and were speeding to a victory on November 8th. He adds, She is absolutely falling like a rock and thats whats happening. The left wing media would do anything to protect her. He points out that the difference in the words used by the candidates. He said, You know, this is what happened, we should all be careful, we live in dangerous times. She said Ive been briefed. He responds, she digs briefings. Epstein points out that while Clinton is a boring candidate. He points to that as the reason she had to rely upon manipulation by the DNC to defeat a 70-year-old socialist in the primaries, and why Trump is leading with millennials, and every other group as well. He points out that Trump would have walked away from the table with Iran and that deal would not have been done. Clinton was the one who initiated it. His successful business career also prepared him for being able to recognize when to leave. He also makes the point that Trump negated what was to be their great next issue, the supposed birther controversy. He negated it completely with his statement that Obama was born in the US and then the word came out that it was Clinton henchman Sydney Blumenthal that was pitching the story around in 2008 as well as members of her campaign. He says Trump is ready for the debates and that he will spin her around in circles. He might want to wear a flashy ring or pin, the kind of thing that might cause Clinton to freeze up and bring Big Dude out to the rescue. That would be great.

0,"Obama Declares All Americans MUST Celebrate SODOMY and Homosexuality, And He Made it Official The Godfather of the gay mafia strikes again! Obama signed an official declarationmaking June 2016 Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride month. Obama says his goal is to eliminate prejudice and celebrate diversity. When are we going to eliminate the prejudice HE hold for anyone who is straight, white or Christian? Obama went on to proclaim, Obama even praised his last declaration that mandated school students share bathrooms with the opposite sex. He said that his administration iscontinuing to promote equality and foster safe and supportive learning environments for all students. All student? What about the young female students who dont feel comfortable undressing or showering with a student that is biologically male? Looks like Obama is extremely selective when it comes to who he feels deserves equality. This declaration is a slap in the face to Christians across the nation. I dont remember anyone asking if Americans were okay with the month of June being dedicated to homosexuality, one conservative blog said. How quickly we mere citizens have morphed into nothing more than serfs in King Hussein-Obamas kingdom. Since when is it okay to disregard the religious beliefs of 80% of the country for only 2% of the population? Apparently, just putting up with gay marriage isnt enough, King Obama demands we must have PRIDE in it! He may be president, but he doesnt speak for the country on this, nor does he have the right to make such an outrageous declaration. Its time to unite and fight back against this liberal war or Christians. WE are the majority, lets start acting like it!! H/T examiner photo credit: dc clothesline "
0,"[Watch] Head of Bin Laden Unit - ISIS and Open Border Will Mean Dead Americans Michael Scheuer, the former head of the CIAs Bin Laden Unit, is asked his views on the release of secret information regarding the failed attempts to rescue James Foley and the possible rationale behind it. He said its a silly attempt but cant figure out an attempt to do what, listing several reasons why it is ill advised to do what the Obama regime has done. He says You dont want to advertise a defeat, I think, and clearly we were defeated in our attempt to get them. Scheuer says you also dont want to put them on the alert, telling them that we know where theyre holding their prisoners or at least that we think we know. Scheuer also point out that by making the announcementand giving the impression that we are still looking, we may have accelerated the timetable. The ISIS terrorists may move up the murders of the other two captive Americans. Scheuer characterized the disclosure as a juvenile thing to do. In response to Obamas portrayal in a statement that ISIS is a cancer, Scheuer says that Obama is where he has been since he became president, that he is absolutely clueless as to what this enemy is up to and what its about. He says its not a cancer, its a worldwide insurgency that we have encouraged consistently by refusing to kill them and through Obamas Arab Spring. Scheuer says the most important thing we can do right now is to close our borders, particularly the southern border but parts of the Canadian border as well. Mr. Scheuer points out that right now, we are exposed not only internationally but within the continental United States as well. Our enemy, he says, wont be marching in in combat order. They will be an insurgency that will infiltrate. Scheuer says its a simple conclusion of logic; close the border, protect America. But we dont have politicians who give a darn about protecting America. Theyre more concerned with not being called anti-Hispanic or anti-human rights. He says Americans will die as a result.

0,"KKK Billboard Racist or Not? There is a billboard along highway 65 in Harrison, AR that is causing a stir in the community. The billboard says Its not racist to love your people. Love lives here. It is sponsored by White Pride Radio. White Pride Radio is a KKK radio station. It is a web based radio station. They have leased the billboard for the whole year and plan to renew the lease at the end of the year. The Mayor of Harrison, Jeff Crocket had this to say: The reflection comes back on Harrison and if we just keep quiet and let him do the speaking, it looks like were all like that and were not like that. Harrison is not like that at all. Thomas Robb is the director of The Knights Club of the Ku Klux Klan. When asked why the billboard was posted, he replied, The message is white people have the right to be proud of who they are. Everybody else has a right to be proud and I dont deny that. The message was not to be racist according to the KKK, just a message that they are proud of their race. The billboard upsets some residents, but others reflect on the meaning and think it isnt a bad sign. The biggest fear in the town is that people will associate the town of Harrison with the KKK, people will leave and the economy will plummet. Although the KKK has a very violent and race supremacist attitude historically, this makes some wonder if this is reverse racism. Why is it okay for BET (Black Entertainment Television), Ebony magazine, BBT (Better Black Television), BOP TV (Black On Purpose TV), Bounce TV and entities like them, to show black pride and not whites? What would everyone think if there was a white history month? It would probably be a national outrage if that happened. So, where do we draw the line? Racism is cried so much that now white people are not allowed to be proud. Would anyone be upset of the billboard said the same thing but had a little black girl on it? It is understood that the people behind it are known racists and murders, but that aside, are we really a fair country when it comes to being proud of who you are? This is not racist. Im white and Im proud to be white and of my white history and heritage. Wheres White History Month? Wheres the NAAWP? The term racism was invented by communists, and is used to destroy cultures and defuse (and render impotent) those with differing points-of-view on racial issues. That being said . . . True racism merely denotes commonality of purpose and advancement within each respective racial group. Blacks have the NAACP and Congressional Black Caucus, Hispanics have La Raza and Mecha, Jews have the $PLC, ACLU and ADL. These are all racist organizations that serve to promote the interests (and political power) of their respective races. It is only whites who are castigated and threatened for attempting to show any signs of racial solidarity. Lets look at what these evil, privileged whites have done for Western society and the world: 1. Civil-rights (for some) laws (that effectively destroy freedom of association for whites, but not for other races) and do not apply to whitesonly people of color are covered by these so-called civil-rights (for some) protections, (Ask Attorney General Eric holder about that). 2. Affirmative action policies (that push better qualified whites out of positions and jobs that they would ordinarily qualify for) in favor of lesser-qualified minorities. In fact, affirmative action policies actually damage those minorities who are quite capable of making it on their own because they get lumped in with the groups that cannot make it on their own without help, 3. Contract set-asides (that are specifically targeted for minorities (that white people are prohibited from bidding on) and immigration policies (that specifically exclude whites, most of who have skills that would benefit the USA) in favor of those from the third-world (with no marketable skills). 4. Scholarships that specify particular ethnic groups are looked upon favorably by most people, save onescholarships that are intended for whites only are looked upon as being racist, and therefore impermissible and improper in todays racially-charged climate of political correctness. NO OTHER RACE (BUT WHITES) HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS to assure that all non-white races receive a fair shake in being a part of American life, even to the detriment and social well-being of our own kind (whites). Whites possess an externalized altruism that no other races possesses. This externalized altruism that looks out for the other guy will be the demise of the white race. This altruism needs to be internalized and focused inward, just as other races have done. There is NO SHAME in looking out for ones own kind. Multiculturalism and diversity are code-words for white genocide. I for one would LOVE to live in Harrison, my kind of town The reason it is considered racist is because of who put it up,but sadly they are probably the only ones with the guts to do it.As you can see everyone is up in arms over it .No one should have to feel ashamed of the actions of their forefathers who they had no control over,but learn from their mistakes to ensure it never happens again. damn right white people should be proud and if blacks were 1/3 as smart as they think they are they would be singing the praises of the whites who imported them to this country other wise theyd more than likely be infected with aids and starving to death or being beheaded by the peace loving muslims. now i know which id choose but then im one of those whities who thinks we are all Gods creatures. I feel like this it is sad that ANYONE needs or feels that they need a billboard to profess their pride in their heritage. I do not care what color you are. That being said if a non KKK organization posted that it would not of even been a blip on anyones radar. I have zero problem with this sign. I do not condone violence bay anyone. I also do not care about the politicizing of issues such as this. This is absolutely a LOCAL matter but be careful you start ask the government to start censoring some words that seems offensive where does it stop? Now on another note if we had a picture with every single shade of American Human then no one would be whining I however respect the constitution. Thus does not violate the constitution. No way do I support the KKK, but the article has some valid points. The point is you can be proud of your people, your ancestors not hate others who do not share the same ancestry, that is where the problem of racism comes in. So many of us have mixed ancestry racial lines you should not judge someone by the color of their skin. I believe we are of ONE RACE that is the human race if you are not a member of the human race, well then we might have a problem. Thank you. I couldnt have said it any better. Thats not even worth commenting on. What the mayor means, Were so racist that we need to encourage black people to think theyre better. Well Mr. Big Pants, first thanks for comparing me to a famous philosopher who was noted for being a founder of modern western philosophy and the main source of Western thought ! Second if you were intelligent as you think you are, and enough to form a sentence that was coherent ( logical and well-organized : easy to understand; having clarity or intelligibility : understandable ) ! Finally if you meant it opposite of how I took it then were in total agreement, therefore only a whiny pin headed liberal would be immature and attack someone without getting all the facts ! To show my age Mr. Big Stuff Who Do You Think You Are ! Blacks are only 14% of the population and therefore should only be reflected in expressions of American society like movies and commercials 14% of the time if you want to be equal. Whites are the predominate majority and that is generally reflected in various expressions throughout society, yet count the times a token black person among whites is added to your average set of commercials verses Hispanics and Asians and youll see how prejudiced you are not only against white expression but other minorities other than blacks. Where is Asian History Month or Hispanic History Month, especially considering both ethnic groups have had as much a fundamental hand in building America as blacks have. The sad reality is if you are a black man exposing the merits of your race you are considered a proud activist, yet if you are a white doing the same you are immediately labeled a racists and a white supremest, which is part and parcel to the liberal manifested white genocide occurring in America today (look it up). Blacks have long eased being victims of evil whitey decades ago (as men like Obama and Colin Powell and women like Oprah and Condalisa Rice have proven) and are now simply the victims of their own self-perpetuated stigmas they force upon themselves becasue they are unwilling to be accountable and accept responsibility for the problems within their own community, or subscribe to race hucksters that need to fuel racism to line their pockets and stay relevant to the sycophant followers, or suffer the Democrat-spawned liberal plantation mentality that exploits incidents like Ferguson to manipulate the black community into believing they most continue to cling to the Democrat party in order to get their racial grievances heard and have their block of gubment social justice cheese delivered to their door on a regular basis. Blacks are their own worst enemies and they are too ignorant, naive or in denial to realize they manufacture their own failure! Not a fan of the KKK, however, I am not offended by this. They can have the radio station, if you dont like dont listen. Hey, I dont watch BET. Oops, that makes me racist, oh shitIm a racist, oh well. I believe in, God, guns working for my money, not taking from the government and family values..Im about as racist as I can be, thats how I was raised.. Lets turn this around, being all fair and equal: If you think black pride is okay, then you are seriously the problem with race relations in this country. If thats seriously all you got from that. Cant have a country that boasts on equality when uh, its evident that inequality exists. All I will say to your rant is this, if you dont like this wretched country you have every right to pack up and leave. Easy there, internet Socrates. If you could not even read my comment correctly, then you are obviously not smart enough to have a say in this matter. Let the adults talk now, little guy. Why do you have to be a racist to be proud of who you are, and are you verifying a double standard then showing your approval of same by your statement?? Now I kind of want to have a straight white male pride parade, or a million hetero white man march. I think it would be fun to draw out the closet racists. No its not. ALSO you dont have to be apart of the KKK to be proud to be white. White folks have bowed down for year for the sensitivity of blacks and enough is enough. Jesus Christ. If you think white pride is okay, then you are seriously the problem with race relations in this country. There is definitely a double standard, but surely you have to realize why it exists. Wake up, people. BUCHANAN TO OBAMA Every one needs to You I I know as many or possibly even more racists that are Black, Asian, Hispanic and Muslim. What about The Black Panthers?? The NAACP?? WE should never allow this to go on. Lets Form the groups and stay above board and force them to go after us and then SUE THEIR ASSES OFF!!! We have a right to honor our past. The right to Assemble, The right to help our own race, We have the right and duty to protect our rights under the Constitution. Lets contact each other and form the groups and act on them and stop talking and complaining. I will start a forum and we can start there, if interested contact on face book I will get it up so anyone interested in our future and ours right can discuss forming the groups Please be serious no.

0,"Fiorina A Failed CEO, Destroyed Thousands Of Americans - Perfect Match For Cruz One of Ted Cruzs many lies that he loves to repeat is the claim that Donald Trump is afraid of strong women. Its obvious that Donald Trump isnt afraid of anyone, with strong women often being recruited to join his companies, sometimes on the spot. Cruz, on the other hand, appears to be attempting to manipulate sexist women or women that value gender over legitimate qualifications in his choice of what he mislabels as a strong woman, Carly Fiorina, as a pretend running-mate. Strong doesnt necessarily equate with good or with being an effective leader. Just as with men, being strong can be accompanied with heartlessness, viciousness, greed and a focus on self. Thirty thousand people lost their jobs at Hewlett Packard as Ms. Fiorina embarked on her pursuit of amassing a fortune and building a name for herself. They became expendable as Fiorina pioneered the practice of off-shoring and replacing American manufacturing jobs with those of other nations, such as China. When Donald Trump talks of American jobs going to China, at some point Fiorina probably comes to his mind. Her claims and those of Lyin Ted that shes a capable leader are disputed vigorously by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, whose lengthy title at Yale is Senior Associate Dean for Leadership Programs Lester Crown Professor in the Practice of Management. In August of 2015 he wrote a blistering review of her tenure at HP titled Carly Fiorina as a boss: the disappointing truth. His opinion, as reflected in the interview, contradicts her claims of a job well done. She enriched herself and left the company a shell of its former self. Thirty thousand people lost their jobs as she bought herself a million dollar yacht. Cruz may be confusing Trumps natural revulsion by an immoral, heartless and corrupt profiteer for fear but hes most likely just being his usual Lyin Ted. Cruz certainly saw those character defects as Fiorinas strengths, making her a strong woman in his eyes because she is an emotionless predator. Its part of what he saw in his fellow globalist as her qualifications for the job, the stuff that makes them such an ideal and despicable match.

0,"RANT: Nancy Pelosi Is A Pathetic Excuse Of A Woman, American, Catholic And Everything In Between After reading some less than charitable remarks from Nancy Pelosi, former Speaker of the House of Representatives who honestly thinks the people of the United States are stupid, this writer really has to respond. The woman is not just dumb as a box or rocks, but doesnt get that she insults the very people her party has lost over the years thanks to not very well thought out social engineering. Those would be straight, white men who happen to not have college degrees and who have a thing for firearms. Check out what the San Francisco twit told Judy Woodruff of PBS: JUDY WOODRUFF: You know that place very well. Right now, Donald Trump is doing much better than Hillary Clinton among white men, and particularly white men who have not attended college. How does Hillary Clinton counter that? REP. NANCY PELOSI: With an economic agenda to create jobs, good-paying jobs, increasing paychecks. The economic agenda is what is really its about the economy. You know that statement. Its not a cliche. Its a fact. And I think that, so many times, white non-college-education educated white males have voted Republican. They voted against their own economic interests because of guns, because of gays, and because of God, the three Gs, God being the womans right to choose. That is softening. Some of those people were never going to be voting Democratic anyway. But I believe that, with the turnout that we expect to have, we will draw some of them in with our message, and enough other people to win the election. So, according to this woman, who is of Italian descent (those people know more about making money than you might think), the uneducated are too blinded by hatred of gays, and love of God and guns to understand just on which side their meal ticket may be buttered. Never mind that millions of jobs that paid the uneducated well have disappeared while she and her ilk have been in charge. Oh, no. Its the angry, white males clinging to their neanderthal traditions that keep them from voting Democrat. Does this woman even think about what comes out of her mouth? Sheesh. Well, Mrs. Pelosi, heres the problem from the bleachers of the unenlightened. Democratic talk doesnt put dinner on the table. It doesnt keep a roof over heads. And it doesnt actually RAISE the next generation. Regardless of education, that is what straight, traditional males do, and by asking them to put all of that aside, the American version of the enlightened are not just insulting the salt of the earth, but emasculating them as well. Come to think of it, demoralizing American men might just be what the nincompoop is actually trying to do. As a fellow Catholic, American woman who has a piece of paper that says she spent a lot of money and a lot of time in a classroom at a university, Nancy Pelosi is an absolute embarrassment as a woman, a Catholic, and advocate of the middle class. In short, God, guns, and proper perspective of gays IS in the best interest of American men. Someone who is in a position of power would do well to think about that before insulting one of the lifeblood classes of Americans. Uneducated white men are the backbone of the people who actually built the country. Just because they have not been trained inside the box of higher education does not mean that they are dumb, have no common sense, and arent hard working. It just means that you, Mrs. Pelosi, have no idea what it means to walk in their shoes. "
0,"Jeh Johnson In Hiding - Open Borders DHS Secretary Invisible Since Terrorist Attacks It seems a little odd that the individual supposedly responsible for protecting America, keeping us safe from all threats, whether foreign ordomestic in origin, is nowhere to be seen in the aftermath of the Brussels bombing. Isnt this the time hed be seeking out microphones to tell us that securing the homeland is our job, that we need to be vigilant and if we see something say something? Is he involved in some super secret deep undercover operation that prevents him from crawling out from under his protective desk to take and possibly even answer questions from the American people? In a way he is. Hes involved in orchestrating the invasion of the United States by foreigners of every stripe and intent, so theres no way he wants to talk on camera about that, at least not until after hes successfully done his part in undermining and destroying thecountry. Hes busy with secret mission stuff. Hes been virtually invisible since Paris and even more so following the San Bernardino attacks. As more strikes happen around the globe, we can expect more of the same as he cant defend the laying bare of our borders and security to any who care to have their way with us. He and Obama are turning America into the equivalent of a Swedish school girl walking past a gang of Muslim refugees. Well be attacked repeatedly, its going to hurt and were going to have to fight them off to survive. But hes safe. Hes doing what Obama wants so his job is protected. The media wont dare ask where hes been. Johnson hasnt been completely silent. On the day following the Brussels attack he put out the all-important Happy Puppy Day greeting to his K-9 officers, probably the only group of non-managerial enforcement employees within DHS who dont loathe him with every fiber of their being. He also issued a written statement in the immediate aftermath of the Brussels attacks, again, from the safety of his inner sanctum. In it he echoed the updated version of the stale French shoulder to shoulder unity pledge, an assertion that we stand in solidarity with the Belgian people in condemning the terrorist attacks. Of course, hes not about to do anything to prevent the same thing from happening in America. The only true means of doing so would be to not allow the terrorists into the country and that would violate the Obama agenda of imposed chaos. Spewing meaningless rhetoric as a substitute for positive action or doing nothing is the job of a complicit, anti-American Marxist posing as a DHS Secretary. In admirably filling the empty drivelcomponent of his position, Johnson wrote, First, our personnel have an excellent working relationship with Belgian authorities, and we continually receive information about the attacks and those who may have been involved. Since the Paris attacks in November, we have enhanced information sharing about potential terrorist threats with both Belgian and French authorities, and we will continue this effort. Let that sink in for a minute Hes citing the information sharing since other attacks as somehow being a reassurance that were safe when it was just demonstrated in the terrorist hotbed of Brussels, with a network of known and unknown terrorists, to have had no impact whatsoever. Thirty people were killed and hes touting it as a success? He reassured Americans that TSA is, as a precautionary measure, deploying additional security to major city airports in the United States, and at various rail and transit stations around the country. TSA is also working closely with state and local law enforcement, airport and transit authorities, and the aviation industry in order to augment that security. He went on to offer assurances in the areas of travel from Belgium, a larger and expanded TSA presence and better communication with other law enforcement agencies. Johnson ispushing the doorman a little closer towards the well-lit front door as the dark alley back door is off of its hinges and lying on the ground. What hypocrisyto pretend to be defending us from the same threats that he is providing unimpeded admittance to if they only choose to enter through a different route. The southern and northern borders are largely vulnerable and undefended, with those who might happen to be apprehended routinely released inside America. particularly upon the utterance of the phrase credible fear of persecution. Regardless of country of origin, thats all they have to say to receive their release, a work permit and an imaginary court date. They also get a good laugh at the stupid Americans, courtesy of Jihadi Jeh Johnson and his Marxist crew. There is no such thing as Homeland Security in America. Its unlikely well see Johnson anytime soon. Hed never be able to justify this mess nor the future attacks which he is making certain are both inevitable and horrific.

0,"Lou Dobbs - FBI Implicated With Clinton In Release Of New 15K Emails The extent of the naked corruption of the Clintons and the persistent stench of the Clinton cartel centerpiece, The Clinton Foundation has infuriated Lou Dobbs. He notes that Clinton, so far, has succeeded in her stonewall of the FBI probe into her use of a private server as she clings to Colin Powell, insisting he made her do it; scapegoating the former secretary of state. She has no shame. says Dobbs, She will obviously try to game anyone and everyone and she is a shape-shifter without conscience as she tries to blame Secretary Powell for her email scheme. Dobbs plays a couple of clips of Clinton claiming through strong implication that Powell was also committing the same espionage offenses that she was. Dobbs says, Notice she links herself to Secretary Powell. But every word she uttered she knew was false as she said those words. Dobbs quotes Powells denial, stating that Clinton was using her personal email set up for a year before he sent her a memo telling her what he did, which was far different from what Clinton was doing and legal. A livid Lou Dobbs reports that the FBI uncovered nearly fifteen thousand previously unreleased emails, beside himself as he asks, Can you believe that? He notes its half again the amount that Clinton said were out there and that it means that shes been lying about even more emails than we knew about. And these new emails raise serious questions as well about the integrity of the FBI investigation and the FBIs conclusions about Hillary, her intent, her lies and her pattern of behavior. He notes that a federal judge has ordered the State Department to accelerate the release of all emails, and points out that Judicial Watch has also released some of the documents they had, an additional 725 pages. Those documents contain more evidence that Hillary Clinton used the foundation to sell access and favors which she arranged and granted in her position as Secretary of State. Mr. Dobbs also credits Judicial Watch for their efforts, as without them, the extent of corruption that permeates everything the Clintons touch, including within the federal government, would never have been known.

0,"Now Trump Knows What To Do To Win Debates Two And Three How did this debate become a replay of the primaries? How were key points that should have been brought up by Donald Trump left un-raised? The open doors where the point was begging to be made, such as when Clinton raised the issue of mental health in connection with what they like to call gun violence. It would have been so easy for Trump to say, You know, Hillary, since you bring up the mental health question, youve been caught bobbing, choking, coughing, falling, needing help to get up stairs, and seizing up in response to disturbances, what is your medical condition? Trump could have directed ten minutes of debate time onto that issue and really forced her to address it in public. He didnt. He did what his handlers told him and it hurt his performance. Those were missed opportunities at a critical time. He called the Clinton email server an illegal one, which is a good terminology, as the networks insist on calling it private and there was nothing private about it. Everybody had a copy of the information contained on it by the time it was introduced to Bleachbit. Why was nothing more pursued in that regard? He tried, and she had an arsenal of if he says this you pivot to this points ready. She was better prepared and it showed. Donald Trump is the better candidate, theres no question about that. Hes the honest American patriot pitted against an anti-American parasite seeking to destroy our nation as she and her media comrades establish a new order. The questions were deliberately boring, get her across the finish line stuff, lacking in substance, and directed against Mr. Trump. Lester Holt said nobody had seen them in advance, but he works for NBC. If he didnt give the Clinton camp a copy of the questions ahead of time its only because they were the ones who wrote them and gave them to Holt. We dont care about Trumps tax returns, Lester. Ask Clinton about her lying, about the Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest, about selling her office for favors to foreign donors, about the sale of American uranium to Russia through Uranium One that she approved, the terrorist connections through Huma Abedin, the fact that neither Cheryl Mills or Clinton signed key documents required by the State Department and that Mills didnt have the proper security clearance. The list of topics and questions that should have been raised is endless. Instead Holt served out yawn inducing defend your tax plans increase to the wealthy and yours decrease to the wealthy. Only a fool would think this whole charade wasnt by design. It was designed to appear as a debate when it was really part of the Clinton four corner offense, running out the clock. Trump did get her a couple of times, including the emails, Blumenthal on the usurpers birth certificate, and her creation of ISIS but he left ignored the open follow up of what she did to Libya as part of her creation of a Middle East in shambles. He said nothing about her plans to import terrorists, legalize illegals and destroy this nation within the first 100 days. He had the opportunity to deliver a knockout punch tonight and it didnt happen. The background and the set were favorable to Clinton. There were no cell phones allowed, the house lights were dimmed so that the whole area behind Holt was black and the likelihood of a health incident being triggered by an unexpected stimulus was greatly reduced. If they had started the debate with a balloon drop or a disco ball flashing wed have likely been done in just a few minutes. It did not appear that Trump was as versed on some of the key comebacks that would have served him well. He now knows, if he didnt before, what to bone up on over the next couple of weeks in order to prepare for the next go round and he knows what posture to adopt. We cant rely upon prayers for her to succumb to her health to do the job for us. Trumps going to have to devote more of his long days to focusing on raising issues in a manner so that she cant hide on a national stage. He has to be prepared with follow-ups to drive the issue home. We already know hes built a great company, we know hes used bankruptcy as a shield in the past. Those are not what people tuned in to hear but its what Holt succeeded in giving them. Trump has to be prepared to redirect the question. Holt didnt ask anything that would have been damaging to Clinton, and as one of her media surrogates he wasnt expected to. The Trump camp has a lot of smart people working for it. They need to identify pivot points of their own, when she says one thing he says another. Thats the only way shell be exposed and, barring another health incident, possibly the only way of defeating her. A lot of Americans, theyre called Democrats, dont mind being stolen from, exploited and lied to by their prospective president. Look at the current ones approval ratings and hes the biggest liar and the most corrupt individual ever to hold the office. Corruption is synonymous with Democrat politicians.

0,"Army Medic Warns - Culture Of Raping Children? Coming To America... This is a comment sent in by an Army medic who has seen the way children are treated by those Obama said he cares so much about. Obama calls them widows and orphans and wants to bring them here. They are coming here to make widows and orphans of our own. Anyone in Washington who doesnt stand up to this madness will be held accountable to the American people. Do your freaking jobs and protect the American children Washington. If you cant do that pack a box and resign because we are tired of your incompetence. God bless America and may He forever bless this world, Shep #Marine4Truth Those interested in the truth will find it. Those interested in PC will follow blindly,Christopher Allard I dont typically go on rants or express my political beliefs here, but I just have to get this off my mind. As some of you know, I was active duty Army. Aside from that, I am a medic. Ive spent 3 years of my life overseas in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Ive seen some pretty atrocious sites caused by war, from both sides. Ive picked up blown up body parts of friends and Ive saved the lives of the guys who were trying to kill me and my guys right before I was keeping them from their 72 virgins or whatever they believe awaits them on the other side. Here is an unbiased, truthful view of the Syrian refugee situation. My first deployment to Iraq, in 2006, my unit voluntarily ran a childrens burn clinic outside of the FOB. It was a constant target for attacks. You would think that people wouldnt shoot mortars or rockets at their own children, but you would be wrong. We saw hundreds of children, from infants to 18 year olds. The overwhelming majority of the kids we saw (90% or better) were clear cases of abuse. These parents literally dunked their kids in boiling water, or throwing hot chai at their kids faces Yes, were talking about babies, toddlers, kids not even old enough to understand why their parents would do these things to them. HUNDREDS of kids We saw quite a few of these kids that were sexually abused, both girls and boys. Their parents acted if nothing was wrong with this, even when confronted by our doctors. This is the mentality of their society, not the viewpoint of a few individuals these beliefs have been accepted by the vast majority of these people. Many were educated, well dressed, well spoken men, but yet, they still raped their own children, and kept chai boys (if you dont know what that means, google it.) During that deployment, we also captured the 3rd largest EFP cache that had ever been captured. There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFPs, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan We had a group of Afghanis that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasnt on a fob) These guys also kept a chai boy A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time. Its their culture, and accepted as the norm. Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items We found Syrian passports during raids And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synagogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured Dont forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot Dont forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts dont lie 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called refugees were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable to you? Chew on it think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want. I would like to thank Christopher Allard for sharing the truth and more importantly his service. He along with everyone in our military fight over there so we dont have to fight here. Well Washington is doing everything they can to provide our enemy with the ability to fight us here. God bless each and everyone, Shep Marine4Truth "
0,"Details Revealed: A Secret Civil Rights Champions Story! Charles Wayne Sullivan. You have probably never heard his name. He is okay with that. Humble beyond all comprehension, he has never sought accolades for his deeds. The sacrifices and risks on the part of this man in the name of civil rights, however, deserve to be known. A quick history: Wayne (as he prefers to be called) was born to a farming family in Oklahoma in 1928. He was the youngest of 7. The Sullivans moved to Texas when he was 4, where he spent the remainder of his childhood. His upbringing was the furthest thing from white privilege you can imagine. Young Wayne turned out to be a terrifically handsome man. Despite this, he never developed an attitude of superiority. After serving the United States Army during the Korean War, he married a young woman named Lucille. The two moved to Tampa, Florida where Wayne attended what is now Florida College. He majored in Biblical Studies and started a career as a Church of Christ preacher. The public civil rights battle begins: While a preacher at a congregation in Georgia in the early 1960s, Wayne received a phone call. A family was traveling through the area and looking for a place to worship that Sunday. He gave the man on the phone the location of the church building and the meeting time. The man then told Wayne that one of the reasons he was calling was to make sure that is was okay for his family to attend service. As it turned out, they were black. Completely unaffected by the familys race, Sullivan assured the man they were welcome. Sunday morning came and brought torrential rain with it. When the family arrived, the elders of the congregation stood and bodily blocked the door to keep them from entering. The elders missed taking the Lords Supper to ensure the family did not get in. Shocked and saddened that anyone calling themselves a Christian would behave in such a manner, Wayne made a split second decision. He ditched the sermon he had planned. Instead, he gave a lesson on racism. He informed the members that the sermon was part 1. Part 2, he said, would be delivered at evening service. After the service ended, the elders informed Sullivan that if he preached part 2 he would be fired. He, his wife, and their children went home and packed. Part 2 was preached, and Wayne was left without a job. The fight goes global: Wayne didnt stop with Georgia. In 1965, he took his belief in equality to another continent. While the civil rights situation in the US was bad, in South Africa, it was worse. The country was still under apartheid. Despite conditions there, the Sullivan family, which now numbered five, collected S H Green Stamps to raise the money for passage. Sullivan accepted a job as a preacher at the Church of Christ in Port Elizabeth. Laws prohibited Wayne from educating black citizens, even in biblical matters. It was a crime to have the black preacher into his home. The penalty for violation was imprisonment. Believing it was more important to obey the laws of God than those of man, he did both. His daughter Cindi recounts one visit. I remember having to hide the preacher in the backseat floorboards with our coats over him. After we snuck him in the house, we had to close all the blinds and eat by candlelight. For three years, Wayne preached to the people, regardless of color, in Port Elizabeth. He continued to treat the black preacher as his equal. He taught his children to do the same. The war wages on: After returning to the US, Sullivan continued to preach. As always, he taught that the color of your skin has nothing to do with the condition of your soul. (As always, he also continued to quote all the verses in sermons from memory. Not relevant, just impressive.) He unwaveringly fought for and defended the rights of all races. Now 87, Wayne still preaches every Sunday. Time has bent his back, but not his will. There have been others like him. Many people have fought tirelessly, out of the public eye, to make a difference. The events recorded here are just highlights of his actions. Wayne Sullivan serves as the perfect example of just what a true civil rights champion is. It is not someone who divides. It is someone who unites. It is not someone who puts themselves in the occasional spotlight. It is someone who lives each day in a way that demonstrates their belief in equality. It is not someone screaming with a poster in the air. It is someone teaching with a bible in their hands. 2016 Vianna Vaughan "
0,"Was The House Sit In A Cover For A Guantanamo Move? On Wednesday, June 22, while the nation was entertained by a bunch of old radicals sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives Chambers, the Obama Administration made a move to release one more long time resident at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The inmates name isAbdel Malik Ahmed Abdel Wahab al-Rahab, hes Yemeni, 37 years old, has spent 14 years at Gitmo, and was once Osama bin Ladens body guard, according to Pentagon documents. In the last two years, it has been determined that al-Rahabi is no longer a threat and that his release would not bring material damage to the United States. The country of Montenegro (was once part of Yugoslavia with direct access to the Adriatic Sea, and land access to the Middle East) has agreed to take on the prisoner. The United States is grateful to the Government of Montenegro for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, the Pentagon said. The United States coordinated with the Government of Montenegro to ensure this transfer took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures, it said. Given the public trepidation regarding closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay since the bad actors housed there have to be locked up somewhere for the safety of everyone, not just Americans, the reality that this action took place under cover of a bunch of Democrats acting like overgrown teenagers does not quite sit right. It could very well be a complete accident of timing given the amount of planning that would have had to go into the transfer, but it does seem curious. The one thing that is certain is that Barack Obama is determined to empty Guantanamo Bay as much as he can before he leaves office in January. With this release, there are now 79 people kept at the facility. "
0,"Go To Church? Colleges And Army Wont Take You Now...Oh, And You Could Get Sued Go To Church? Colleges And Army Wont Take You Now Imagine being told that you face a tough choice. You can either quit going to church or be punished. It may sound far fetched, but that is exactly what has happened. Government authorities have informed students that they will be blocked from attending college if they do not cease church attendance. No college entrance exams will be allowed to be taken while a student still professes Christianity. As if that wasnt enough, those same young people will also not be permitted entrance into the Army, either. For that matter, anyone attending the churches located inside homes can face punishment. Parents bringing their children to one can face a law suit for doing so. A document has been produced by officials that must be signed by parents. It is a vow that they will not take their minor children to Christian church services that take place in a home. Where on Earth is this allowed to go on? Only the worlds most populated nation. It is China. According to China Aid, a human rights group, an official notice was received by the home churches. This notice was sent to all of the schools in Huaqiu, explained the man in charge of Huaqiu Church. They (public security) intend to cleanse us and ask us to join the Three-Self Church. The Communist government there has strengthened its efforts to eradicate Christianity. Home churches have been attacked the hardest. State-run churches havent gone unscathed, though. Buildings have been demolished and crosses torn down at an alarming rate over the last few years. Preachers have been arrested along with anyone who dares protest. Those numbers are in the hundreds. Communist leaders fear the rise of the religion in their country. Their persecution of its followers is an attempt to ensure that Christians do not grow to outnumber members of the Party. Sounds kind of like a certain Pharaoh with his Hebrew slaves. Hopefully, this situation will result in a similar outcome. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox News "
0,"[Watch] Reality Check: War On Women Goes To The Ladies, Ben Shapiros Take Hillary Clinton and her magic X chromosomesand she rose to national prominence because of her husband. Minor little fact. According to the statistics Ben Shapiro provides, by every measure EXCEPT taking time to raise kids the most important job adults have in civilization thus resulting in lower wages in some jobs, women have come out ahead in the last fifty years. Domestic abuse (male on female) is down, contraception for the people too lazy to pay attention to their bodies and a calendar is cheap, women are getting more advanced degrees, womens starting salaries are higher. To the War on Women revolutionaries, the main function of a womans life that seems to be holding some back in their own minds is more or less biological: women are the humans who give birth and nurse newborns. Perpetuating the species is considered a hinderence to material gain. Never mind continuation of humanity and civilization. The sacrifice isnt considered noble in that context. So, does that mean that the War on Women is really about getting Hillary Clinton elected president, or is it one battle in the war on the family? Either way, the women have won and have betrayed their natural purpose in life all at the same time. "
0,"Mother Shoots intruder to save her child, But Now SHE is the Victim of an Anti-Gun DA PORTLAND, Oregon A mother who returned to her Portland home with her two children early Sunday morning shot and killed an intruder who was inside, police said. Tara-Alexis Ford, 33, found a stranger in one of her childrens bedrooms inside her home about 1:45 a.m. Armed with a handgun, she shot and killed the man, who has been identified as David Daniel McCrary, 59, from Gresham. The Oregon State Medical Examiner determined that McCrary died of a single gunshot wound. Detectives dont know why McCrary, who has no significant criminal history, broke into Fords home. There is no connection between Ford and McCrary, and he is not from the neighborhood. A recent report indicates that McCrary may have dealt with mental health issues. According to detectives, McCrary broke into Fords home through a back window. He was found by Ford in the bedroom of her 10-year-old daughter, where the shooting happened. Fords daughter and her 5-year-old son were in a different bedroom at the time. Neighbors who spoke with KGW say they think Ford did the right thing. I would be scared. I would be scared, said neighbor Linda Ternes-Kent. But she had to do what she had to do. I would have done the same thing.Another neighbor said that before Ford moved in the place had squatters in and out of there. The Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill, will review all the evidence in this case. Charges will be brought against Ford if he believes she did not act out of self defense.For this mother all she was doing was protecting her two children and herself from the unknown. This man broke into her home and invaded her life. There should be no question if it was out of self defense. The fact that the police have made it clear that he broke in is a clear enough indication that his intentions were not good. She had no way of knowing how far he was willing to take his criminal actions that day. Now she is being treated as a criminal for doing what is natural as a mother, parent, and a human being. Protecting your life and the lives of those you love. This is part of what is wrong with our justice system. There are more rights for the criminals than there are for the law abiding citizens. The fact that this man has no prior record means nothing, at some point every criminal has no prior record. Good or bad we all start somewhere, why drag this woman through more than she has already been through. We can only hope that the ties that Rod Underhill has to people like Gabby Giffords does not play a role in his decision on this case. "

And there are those who just dont understand the difference. On a flight from Portland, Oregon to Charlotte, North Carolina First Sergeant Albert Marle asked a flight attendant if he could hang up his uniform jacket to keep it from getting wrinkled. What followed has outraged many and led to a growing chorus of people calling for U.S. Airways to issue at minimum an apology to this decorated soldier. The flight attendant flat-out refused his request, said the service was available only to first class passengers, and according to passengers she even yelled at the decorated Army Ranger as well as other outraged passengers who objected or tried to switch seats with Sgt. Marle so that he could simply hang up his jacket. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. When he asked if he could hang his coat up to keep from getting wrinkled, he had a chest full of medals- many deployments. All she had to say was, Yes, said Cliff Autrey, who was on the flight from Portland, Oregon, and who says he is considering switching to a frequent flyer club of another airline after the incident. In the end, a first class passenger took the Rangers jacket and hung it up behind his seat with his own clothing despite the protestations and yelling of the Flight Attendant. Its nice to know that if U.S. Airways is not willing to show our professional warriors the respect they deserve there are still those in society who will stand up and do so. A big thank you to those who stood up for him and we thank and appreciate First Sgt. Marle for his service to our country even if U.S. Airways doesnt. This flight attendant showed an incredible lack of professionalism and turned what could have been an easy and positive gesture of goodwill and respect into one that will undoubtedly cost her employer business and reputation as the story of this incident spreads. Members of the military deserve our respect and perhaps stories like this help us to remember that and keep it in the forefront of our minds. "

0,"Saying Make America Great Again Is Not Cursing And This Is Still America...Right? The ESL Student and probable illegal alien working in a job for Frontier airlines that should have gone to an American was obviously given the position in spite of her lack of qualifications. She seems unable to distinguish between her own racism and the ability to carry out her duties as a representative of the airline. She also seems to have fully bought into the anti-Trump Democrat propaganda. Her crash course in the English language may not have properly defined Make America Great Again, so all she has to go on is what Hillary Clinton and Luis Gutierrez tell her. Trumps a racist the propagandists say so this passenger quoting Trump equates to him making racist comments to her. Maybe she knows that make America great means the illegals have to go and she likes it here. Shes clearly concerned as things spiral beyond the level of where discretion and common sense dictated they be left. She seems aware that forcing the passenger to get off is going too far and putting his travel companion in a situation of having to choose between leaving him stranded and traveling on alone or being stuck alongside him is way beyond justified. The important thing is she got to exert her authority over the Gringo. Shes the big woman in her new town. The entire gang of apparent inbreds seems to have no idea of what they are doing or why they are doing it. Even if he had used foul language, he wasnt a threat, he wasnt aggressive and he wasnt drunk; he was civil. That isnt even an issue. The contention is that the Gringo told her Make America Great Again and she didnt like it. She cant and wont even tell him what he did wrong because its not wrong, its not a violation of any law to recite a campaign slogan. Conversely, to kick someone off of a plane because of their political speech is a violation of our Constitution. Just as the Black Lives Matter thugs attack Trump supporters in rallies, this woman is also a thug. Aside from the lack of physical violence, shes no different from the punks attacking innocent men and women exercising their political freedom. Part of working in customer service positions is dealing with people who arent necessarily behaving in a manner that is ideal. Theres no way to avoid it, its part of the job. If she cant handle it, which seems to be the case, then she should get a job somewhere else. And since she seems to struggle with speaking and understanding English, perhaps a second look at that ID and verification that it isnt a stolen Social Security number through E-verify would be a good measure for Frontier. They are an American airline, arent they? The bossy woman got her way, she successfully kicked the man off in order to make her political statement, and made her employer look very unprofessional and second or third rate in the process. Frontier airlines owes these people an apology their plane-Nazi a swift kick in the backside and out the door. "

His mother, Leslie McSpadden, has requested that Browns image and memory not be used for self-serving business and profit purposes. Browns grandmother and at least one cousin disagree. From Fox 2 News: It happened Saturday night, October 18th, at about 8:15 pm in the parking lot of Reds BBQ. It`s the corner of Canfield and West Florissant, just blocks from where Michael Brown was shot and killed. Police sources tell us Brown`s Grandmother, Pearlie Gordon, along with Brown`s Cousin Tony Petty, were selling t-shirts and other Michael Brown merchandise. A police report describes a car pulling up and several people getting out. One of those people, was reported to be Michael Brown`s Mom, Lesley McSpadden. A witness described McSpadden yelling You can`t sell this s%$ One of the relatives, who was selling, reportedly demanded McSpadden show a document proving she had a patent. A patentokay, well, whatever documentation Grandmama and the relatives needed, is beside the point. There was a street brawl that evening that resulted in the cousin, Tony Petty, being hit so hard in the face by McSpadden (Browns mother) that he was taken to a local hospital.

Gots da money now to add some purple highlights to that Lucy hair. Says the complete moron with Haters Gone Hate in his avatar signature! Actually, its their nigger nature. They dont learn anything except how to be more of a nigger in the pavement congo they terrorize and claim ownership over. Weez needs a tripz back to the Africas! (so that America can recover from these heinous pieces of shit) Thats because they ARE animals. Look at the features of a gorilla, and then look at the everyday nigger. They are in the pavement congo instead of the jungle. Thats the only difference. I expected Al Sharpton to roll up with the mother and demand his cut from the money box, too. Niggers cause riots, Evelyn. They have no interest in stopping them. It lets them express their savagery. Duh! Because theyre niggers. Its what they DO. And dont feel bad, because theyre really not humans. They can interbreed, but other than that, theyre animals through and through. Im not religious, but even in your bibles you see stories about niggers being evil and destructive (Caananites). Theyve always been monsters. African isnt a persuasion, its a walking degenerative disease and curse! Thats typical nigger behavior though. Did anyone really expect them to have white or asian class? Blacks (savages) aint got time fo dat. din do nuffin officuh! dey racest cops jus bee pickin on duh black peepholes! Niggers. Cant you read? Youre excused. Niggers. Thank you!!!! Excuse me? Yall sound plain ignorant. That man did not have to kill him!!!!! Police been killing black people since the beginning of time. Our lives matter to. How would yall feel if they were killing white men. People have disagreements thats what family do. The problem is she cant grieve in peace having to deal with shit like this. WURRRR STARRRR !! WURRRR STARRRRR ! SHARKEISHA !! Looks like Thug animal is passed through DNA! The Hood -be- the HOOD! word.. And that is the real question. they must be missin the bling he used to bring home from his job as a thug From the Never Let A Good Tragedy Go To Waste DepartmentMake a buck however you canI wonder if the State and IRS will check this small business and make sure theyre paying state sales taxes and declaring the income theyre making ? The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. The acorn doesnt fall to far from the tree. Did they have permits to sell these was the proper taxes paid so that everything was legal or were they illegally selling shirts and not paying taxes I say that they should be fined and or face the consequences for insiting a riot amongst the people and being a public neusents What cracks me up is that the media tries to pain Brown like some friggin boy scout! The dude was a slime ball banger Apple didnt fall far from that tree, I see These Kneegrows never cease to amaze. Apple doesnt fall far from the tree If this had been the Sarah Palin family it would have had the first 10 minutes on the evening news with Brainless Williams. How many surnames are in this family? None of them have the same last name. Start there. TRIBE OF THIEVES I wonder if Thuggery is genetic?? Why would she grab the money box and run off with it if shes not interested in profiting from this? This is sad!! I feel for the loss of A human being without a doubt that is sad!! BUT it looks like all the evidence is pointing to the kid being at fault. from the video of him robbing a store,to all the forensic evidence,I think the cop was justified.. but what I dont understand is why certain people of the African persuasion have to riot loot,break in stores,destroy things, cause damage,make death threats if they dont get what they want.. What ever happened to thee due process of law before all the evidence and everything is even out there right away user looting destroying robbing stores making death threats going crazy automatically assuming just because hes black he was killed because of race what do you think the rest of the world thinks? Do you see any other race doing the things that you do? EXACTLY TO SAY THE LEASTTHEY SHOULD ALL BE PUT DOWN How funny would it be if people looted the t-shirts while the family riot was going on! Will they accept EBT at the t-shirt table? Let me guessthe COPS were bought in to break it up? I know its wrong, but this is Sadly Entertaining. Like a Car wreck, dont want to look but the FORCE is STRONG in this DISASTER Sad sad sad but not surprising at a time when a family should be grieving and honoring the memory of a loved one they are rolling around in the street fighting over who gits to sell T-shirts ! Dear ol mom is most likely mad cause granny beat her to the punch makin a dollar off of her son ! The people of Ferguson and St. Louis should not waste another minute of time or effort on these thugs ! But unfortunately once the verdict clearing officer Wilson is read there will be rioting in the streets like nobodies business I hope I am wrong but sadly most likely not . The thug didnt fall far from the tree, did it? Mike Browns mom: YOU CANT SELL THAT !!!! . but, on second thought, Ill take the cash. Well this pretty much cinches the case. The Brown family are just violent thugs. It should be very simple now to have Ofc. Wilson completely exonerated from any wrongdoing whatsoever. in the meantime, on what day and time will she be turning over the gross receipts from the T-Shirt sales to pay for some of the things that were looted in her babys name ? And how much is Darren Wilsons cut. After all, her son would never be famous if it werent for the good works of Ofc. Wilson! He was such a good boy w/good role models surrounding him. We now know what is going to take Honey Boo Boos place! They should at least do a Thanksgiving special! Get them all in one room with food and forks and knives. Sweet! Phucking animals Sience beez raysis. Brown was killed, and his skin was black. Therefore, Brown = victim. Thanks a lot, Nancy Grace. You ugly stupid b1tch. Lol subhuman savage beasts This story says it all. Trayvon and Brown got what they deserved. The good old ventilation treatment to cure the over groid-ance of their areas of town. gentle giant my a$$. More to come, brought to you by rap music and malt liquor. SHOWS THE NUT DIDNT FALL FAR FROM THE TREE, I WOULD LAUGH IF THE MOTHER GETS ARRESTED FOR THUG ROBBERY,GUESS THATS WHERE HER KID LEARNED IT FROM, I HOPE SHE RESIST ARREST, THAT WOULD BE SO COOL.BITCH. wtf What are people thinking these days. Rioters are just trying to get their names in the papers and if the media does it they are crazy. PLANET OF THE APES You hit the nail on the head there. The are a bunch of ignorant thugs living off of our tax dollars No the one word is niggers. Looks like they are filming Hood Life Volume 4 in Ferguson. Umwhy are people saying she is the one selling stuff. Did anyone read the article. The other relatives and grandma are doing it. She told them no and got upset when they wouldnt stop. Geeshread. It is sad that this young man is dead even if it is justified. What these people are doing in Ferguson isnt justice for Mike Brown it is for total disrespect for authority , how is destroying and doing all this crap respecting the dead, it isnt. This is just an act of people that feel sorry for themselves because they are black and cant succeed in life. Well guess what there are plenty of succesful black people, what they did was get out of bed, put the weed down and worked,,, yes thats right worked, these people in Ferguson are destroying there own community, i say quit showing them attention and let the animals play!!! LOL! Good One! LOL Niggers acting like niggers, who would have thought? The whole family in nothing but thugs. Like mother, like son. Welcome to the jungle! What a bunch of uneducated hoodrats! But the baby boy was an angel. Ha! Apple didnt fall far from the tree. The whole family has a rap sheet, Im sure. Mikey didnt even live with the mother, if you can even call her that. She has some other man. His father, I mean sperm donor, lives with some other woman. Punk lived with Granny, who was also involved in the altercation last Sat. They are just looking for a payday off their dead thug sons death. Her boy took after Mom, Sh*ts getting old! Uuuuhhhhh The APEple Needs to be sent back to the trees. The mother had the right to sell or not to sell. Without her permission, they should have never sold a thing. You can dress them better, give them words to say, but at the end of the day these people are just trashy ghetto slime. They have spent their whole lives fighting and breeding, all the perfume in the world will not cover the stink of entitlement on this family. Thug see, thug do What a F-ing jokeso distraught over their baby boys death that they have to sell t-shirts? And then fight over selling them????? Wow. The racially charged comments here are sickening. ANIMALS! Wild sheboons fighting and tearing off weaves as usual. DEY DIN DO NUFFIN !! WURRRR STARRRRR !!! WURRRR STARRRRR !! Hey, theres money to be made Just send in the National Guard and start blasting away if they refuse to settle down. They are breaking the law and that is a fact! They need to PAY for their lawlessness. America needs to know that we are all safe from would-be lunatics like them! THIS is where the term, SO GHETTO comes from! Around blacks, never relax. Do you not have spellcheck, or double check your writing? Surrveilance video appearantly picked up the altercation and has not been released yet. Really? Ill take BOYZ in da HOOD, for 100, Alex! Who gets a patent on their dead sons name??? Sick. Who exactly wants to be a fat black bully? Maybe they need rent, or some gin and juice. Self-explanatory activities in Niggville. It is ALWAYS about the money and who gets it. if Oblama had a son. I wonder if you have to show you are smoking weed and willing to assault an armed police officer in order to wear one of those I AM MICHAEL BROWN T-Shirts? PANTS UP! DONT LOOT! Holy shit, you do nt have a fucking CLUE what a patent is. Also, cool off in the number of ads in your shitty shite. Dumb fuck. And the award for Best Comment goes to ^^^^ Wees cant be following no white mens laws, wees be angry cuz da white mens laws!!! Similar to the Duncan family looking to cash in on the EBOLA death. Typical, looking for a lottery win off of a tragedy those are our nations laws and if you dont like them you are free to leave the USA and go where ever you want.We are a nation of laws for everyone and those laws do not have a color typical black culture values violence in the home, violence in the streets, violence on others private property, violence on government property, violence perpetrated on whites, violence aired on TV. Some wonder if Jim Crow was on to something??? These people truly do not understand Christian values, do not understand civil behavior This black culture of rage is even beliw the rage and hatred of Muslims No wonder so many black felons while in jail join the Black Muslim Brotherhood The values of both cultures encourages violence on family and all through society that these cultures reject. Its far from dead the rioters will never accept the evidence and will riot some more and then we will see some blood shed and it might really turn out nasty.I hope Im wrong,we can do nothing more than wait and see Greed! I still say the officer should file a lawsuit for slander and defamation of character. The family is making money off of implying that he murdered someone. That cash box that Browns mother took should go (at least partly) to Officer Wilson. And they wonder why their precious innocent thug got himself killed. Learned his behavior at home apparently. What mother? You mean the woman whoop have birth to him? The experiences Ive had with the nogs that run around my neighborhood is that their mothers allow them to run wild until God forbid you ask them not to call your eight year old daughter a fing Bitch then they wanna fight like a animals. THIS MOTHER FUCKER COULD NOT LEAD MY ASS TOO WATER WE BETTER WAKE UP MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WE ARE GOING TO BE FUCKED THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO GROW BY MILLIONS TALKING ABOUT RAPING THE CONSTITUTION JUST WAIT unfortunately I wish I could agree as far as the story being dead here we are discussing what is going in the media so its alive and strong, its on the news every morning. The cop was doing his job PERIOD, there are things about his youth and being charged for murder at the age of 15 but hey that sealed that fast which is against the law. But they are doing as they please. My thoughts exactly!! A patent!?! LOL What a bunch of morons. Proves what kinda people they really are! Huh ! oh they already have all the evidence, its been processed, they found Browns blood and one finger print on the interior of the police car, from the way the bullets entered and exited his body, he was not 10 feet away with his arms raised, nor was he running away, the holes have gun shot residue and stippling burns around the bullet holes, and even a shot to the top of his head because he was leaning over into the car reaching for the cops gun, proof is there, I think they are waiting till after the elections to give out the news, though with how the media is, there is no story for them to feast over anymore, they cant call the cop a racist killer because the media knows about the proof of evidence, thats why the story is pretty much dead now in the media They seem like lovely people. I hope they keep breeding. God Bless America. Is that a Buick Grand National in the background? All these relatives and nobody has the same last name! Looks like the Ferguson police may yet be able to prosecute a family member for assault and robbery Blacks will be Blacks in da Hood! Wow.justwow. Hmmmm, why would I want to be Mike Brown? He is dead and well deserved! What law abiding citizen goes for a police officers gun? These idiots prove that the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. Stupid is as stupid does. I feelnothing for these people Hilarious. I hope someone filmed it. They are just following their mentor, Sabrina Fulton, Traygones mother. Trayvons Foundation is raking in the money for Jackson and Sharpton. CANT WAIT TO SEE THAT VIDEO ON WORLD STAR HIPHOP Itll fit right in with the rest of the hood-rat fights This is hilarious, this thugs family are rioting over who gets the money from his t-shirt sales, wow! What class,this is probably the first and only legal dollar the thug ever provided for this family and they are beating each other up like a bunch of crows fighting over road kill. violence,greed,thieft and lies and thats MBs family.Im still trying to figure out why grandma didnt stop and pick him up when she saw him walking down the middle of the street. Boy I thought my family was dysfunctional EXACTLY!!!!! As she stood there and stated she didnt want to make money off her Gentle Giant my ASS but I have to say she has a good right hook LMAO!!!! Everything comes out in the wash it will all come out not through the media but a average sleuth looking for info will let us know!!! Its already not looking good for the fool. If they all had job and not live off welfare they would need sleep for the next day, but nope let that POS gives them their entitlements and has his thugs go down there and take care of business, ha slap you POS in your flippin face. SO DONE!!!!! Just proves low class GHETTO Family with a smig of VIOLENCE, the same act that got her son killed by a police officer, she administered to her NEPHEW. Classy really classy!!!! This is getting old. If the mother would have raised him difference he might be here today.You can clearly see, how there acting, he was not taught any thing but causing trouble.Now there starting a tee shirt sale, like he is running for office or something lauuuggghhhh my asss off. To be continued on Jerry Springer. What ? ! not to cheat,steal or lie ? How do you think the pResident attained that office ? Mike Browns family taught him to be a thug just like them, to bad Obama is to busy raping the Constitution to stand up and act a leader to the country and teach people to respect and help one another rather than steal, cheat and lie! THOSE ARE white man laws! I dont really blame her for not wanting her dead sons name and/or image exploited for profit. Seems to me, though, that she might want to get active in stopping the riots and b.s. going on in his name. Race baiting is a money making business. What do you expect.. monkey mentallity Arrest them for selling without a license. Thats justice!!!!! Hmmmmm. looks like the apple doesnt fall far from the tree now does it Needs a bullseye circle. IF SHE ACTS LIKE THAT, NO ONE CAN TELL ME BABY BOY WAS A GENTLE GIANT. You can take em out of the jungle, but.. If they really did not like the merchancise bein sold,,His Mom should have called police to have the stuff siezed as contraband,until a permit was obtained or family was contacted about haveing selling rights for what ever it was with Family shreing of Money. one word..SAVAGES "
0,"[Watch] 60,000 Foreign Visa Overstays in One Year, Whereabouts Unknown, Each a Potential Terrorist While the Obama regime has been busy opening up the floodgates of the southern border to anyone who chooses to come in, they have also failed to police the notorious visa overstays. That is the method of access which was determined to have been exploited by those responsible for carrying out the terrorist attacks of 9/11, 2001. The Obama regime is deliberately dismantling our security and flooding this country with foreigners of every description, many of which have intentions of doing us harm. They are not simply stupid, they are treacherous. The report highlights how one of the top recommendation of the 9/11 commission was to revamp and clean up the student visa system. In spite of that urgent warning, nothing has been done. Senator Jeff Sessions describes that failing as a matter of national security. DHS, the agency supposedly responsible for safeguarding our nation, is actively involved, through the Obama operative Jeh Johnson, in gutting our security protections and leaving us vulnerable to attack from a variety of sources. ICE issued a pathetic defense of the indefensible, saying, Any insinuation that ICE is not actively investigating visa overstay cases with links to potential links to national security and public safety is false. The agency has made numerous improvements to visa security since 9/11. Their defensive argument is false. Investigating cases is much different from protection and enforcement. DHS and ICE leadership has together created a situation where enforcement is a thing of the past and only those identified as possible terrorists receive scrutiny. All other illegal aliens who have managed to escape the potential link to national security label are free to roam about as they choose. Its much the same line of thought as Hussein Obama holding meetings on ISIS for months with his national security advisors and describing that process as having a strategy. The system is a joke, as is our Department of Homeland Security under this regime. The schools, which in addition to universities, include institutions instructing in beauty, massage, hair-braiding, tennis, golf and shoeing horses, are responsible for student oversight and reporting. The State Department is completely outside the loop, as are DHS and ICE. The report cites numerous examples of schools not doing the governments job of policing the visa program. Homeland Security and ICE seem content to play catch-up after the fact. Megyn Kelly points out that Obama has been telling us in recent days that there is no immediate threat to the homeland. She quotes from a joint op-ed posted by Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron in which they take a shot at their critics, saying, First, those who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century. Within the same document, they contradict themselves to a degree, saying, Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home. Kelly says, Congressman, my head is going to explode, which is it? They are a threat to the homeland or they are not? Congressman King says they are a real threat and enumerates the different reasons why and the different varieties of terrorists. The dismissive tone of Obamas comments, that this community organizer turned leader somehow understands security or any other issue better than the American people is absurd. Hes in over his head, he cant handle the job, and we, the American people are going to be the ones who pay the price for his ineptitude and the ignorance of our fellow Americans who bought his line of bolognatwice.

The nickname Lying Ted Cruz has just taken on a whole new meaning after several news outlets have reported that Cruz has been caught cheating in FIVE different affairs. The original story was exposed by the tabloid National Enquirer. I know what you are thinking, but keep in mind that NE has been right before when it comes to exposing politicians sex scandals, John Edwards anyone? The National Enquirer writes: So could this really be true and if so, who are these women? The conservative treehouse brought up a great point regarding the validity of this story. After this story hit Twitter several sources came forward and claimed that at least 3 of the women have been identified as Katrina Pierson, Sarah Isgur Flores, and Amanda Carpenter. Amanda Carpenter is a writer for Mark Levin and Conservative Review. She is also an avid Cruz supporter. Sarah Isgur Flores was the campaign manager for Carly Fiorina who has also openly supported and endorsed Ted Cruz. Katrina Pierson is a spokeswoman for Trump. It could be that she got involved with Cruz to destroy his political campaign, but that is just speculation. Ill be sure to keep this story updated as Im sure it wont be going away anytime soon. "

0,"Obama Tells Republicans to Stop Being Mad, Hatin All The Time, Just Let Him Be King As usual, B. Hussein Obama sees everything as being about him. Even if our great divider, the narcissist-in-chief, doesnt actually believe it, hell still present his case that way. He benefits from making it personal and labelling others as bigots, racists, and any other demeaning label he thinks he can make stick. He believeshis base to be so mentally challengedthat they will allow him to manipulate them, right before their own eyes They have thus far not disappointed. He sees them as shallow racists or sexists themselves, who will put those irrelevant factors ahead of what benefits or worse, what could destroy, their nation. On Wednesday, in a speech in Kansas City, Obama went after Republicans who are standing up to him and for our country, saying they need to stop just hatin all the time. So now, in the distorted and perverse Democrat universe, standing up for your country and Constitution against a dictator is a hateful act. The lifelong communist is facilitating an invasion of our country by our enemies to the south, and those trying to prevent it and defend our nation are haters? He made his insane comments in another of his new more folksy, under the influence of something-sounding speeches, telling Republicans to Stop being mad all the time. Stop, stop, stop just hatin all the time. Everything is always about him and that other branch of government is simply being unreasonable. They just need to disband and declare him King. He once again invoked implied racism, saying, Theyre not happy that Impresident, but thats OK. Come on! Ive only got a couple of years left, come on, lets get some work done. Then you can be mad at the next president. He might be shocked to learn that he is not important. Other than being the figurehead of the communist takeover of America, he is a skinny little girly-man that nobody cares for or about. He was manoeuvred into office to perform a destructive function. That alone is what makes him relevant. His glaring lack of character, coupled with his handlers having the means to put him into the dangerous position he now illegitimately holds, is the only thing that makes him significant, and it will be fleeting. Once those hateful republicans expose just what hes been up to, hell wish he hadnt made things so personal. Eric Holder wont be able to protect him forever.

0,"[Watch] John McCain Say Malaysia Airliner Has Earmarks of Tragic Mistake - Really? The earmarks of a tragic mistake are an interesting concept. He indicates he has determined from the limited evidence presently available that the missile which brought down the Malaysian Airliner over Ukraine was accidentally fired, a mistake. That is suspicious language from the war-monger McCain, that he would label something a mistake in the first place and secondly with very limited information upon which to base his determination. Of course, it would be in keeping with and a boost to McCains drive to arm the Ukrainians if he were able to blame the Russians. That fact alone calls into question his comments as well as there being no possible upside for the Russians to the downing of a civilian airliner. Were the Ukrainians able to down an airliner and successfully pin the responsibility on the Russians, they would be able to make a much more credible argument in favor of the world providing them with lethal weapons and aid. That is the only motive that seems logical at this point. McCains comments could be seen as having the earmarks of someone who wants to set the narrative that his opponents are guilty before all of the evidence has even been collected. This is a serious matter and their is no reason or benefit to the United States in jumping to premature conclusions. One things is certain, there is more to this than first meets the eye.

0,"Flower-Power Christians Ask Obama To Give Peace A Chance In The Middle East Now that all sorts of pacifist and non-violent minded people have called on the world to eliminate and neutralize the terrorist threat known to the world as ISIS or ISIL or IS depending on who is doing the talking, 53 national religious groups are petitioning Barack Obama and the Regime to help the civilians in Iraq, but not use any kind of military force against the aggressors. What, do these flower people think that the young, passionate, bloodthirsty jihadis are going to see all the love and goodness flowing to the infidel and just surrender? The terrorists are going out of their way to behead Christians just for being Christians. What exactly IS in those brownies the aging hippies are serving? Much to the embarrassment of many of the Faithful, the petition letter appeared on the website of the Maryknolls, a Catholic order that left the catechesis reservation some time ago and is working its way into extinction. (All the still liberal orders are.) Unfortunately, several of the co-signers are from other orders also working their way into extinction. And what do the stuck in the 60s sorts have to say? As religious communities, leaders, and academics, we write to express our deep concern over the recent escalation of U.S. military action in Iraq. While the dire plight of Iraqi civilians should compel the international community to respond in some way, U.S. military action is not the answer. Lethal weapons and airstrikes will not remove the threat to a just peace in Iraq. Maybe not, but lethal weapons and airstrikes will destroy the aggressors stolen lethal weapons which can be used against the innocent civilians thus increasing the likelihood that peace might be achieved once the dust settles. As difficult as it might be, in the face of this great challenge, we believe that the way to address the crisis is through long-term investments in supporting inclusive governance and diplomacy, nonviolent resistance, sustainable development, and community-level peace and reconciliation processes. Theyre kidding, right? ISIS jihadis are more likely to shoot those preaching peaceful overtures just to get them out of the way of a tank column. Pope Francis has affirmed that peacemaking is more courageous than warfare, and more recently said that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. I underscore the verb stop; I dont say bomb, make war stop him. But how, we ask? Yes, but when the enemy is determined to destroy YOU, and has zero mercy or tolerance, which are key necessities to a lasting peace, without divine intervention, there has to be some kind of clash. For historical perspective, please review the defensive nature of the Crusades. Theres some more nonsense that demonstrates why religious leaders are not the best arbiters of foreign policy and military action. And then the good and peaceful Christians throw all Just War Theology out the window and provide a step by step plan on how to give peace a chance: Stop U.S. bombing in Iraq to prevent bloodshed, instability and the accumulation of grievances that contribute to the global justification for the Islamic States existence among its supporters. And who is going to destroy all the American military equipment the bloodthirsty terrorists stole with which they are shedding blood and destablizing what is left of Iraq? At this point, grievances are off the table. Provide robust humanitarian assistance to those who are fleeing the violence. Provide food and much needed supplies in coordination with the United Nations. Or asylum somewhere. Seriously, why does everyone call on the United Nations in international crises? In order to get any sort of humanitarian assistance into the Iraqi mountains, its going to take a military convoy. And whos military will be used? The United States. So why not cut out the middle man? Engage with the UN, all Iraqi political and religious leaders, and others in the international community on diplomatic efforts for a lasting political solution for Iraq. Ensure a significantly more inclusive Iraqi government along with substantive programs of social reconciliation to interrupt the flow and perhaps peel-back some of the persons joining the Islamic State. In the diplomatic strategy, particularly include those with influence on key actors in the Islamic State. This particular enemy isnt interested. The ISIS terrorists overran cities and made the bloodshed look glorious to young, impassioned believers just like the dreamers of the 60s were when they revolted against the established social order. Work for a political settlement to the crisis in Syria. The conflicts in Iraq and Syria are intricately connected and should be addressed holistically. Return to the Geneva peace process for a negotiated settlement to the civil war in Syria and expand the agenda to include regional peace and stability. Ensure Irans full participation in the process. Ensure IRANs full participationseriously, what is in those brownies? Yall do know that there is no such thing as freedom in Iran, right? Theres Iranian women who post pictures of themselves on the internet in remote locations of that country after taking off their headscarves. Beautiful women who call it Stealthy Freedom because thats what it is. They cant go bareheaded in Iranian the cities without being arrested for violating Sharia law. And the Geneva Convention? Thats followed by civilized peoples. The ISIS-IS-ISIL members and recruits cut off peoples heads. That is not civilized. No convention or international treaty is going to stop them. Only brute force will. Theres more in the letter that is an insult to anyone with any clue of what has been going on in the Middle East for the last hundred years. No use rehashing it. In the meantime, while prayer and appeals to a higher power should always be a part of not simply a peaceful resolution to conflict, but defeat of evil, recognition that there is such a thing as justified force must also be a factor. The Caliphate of the Islamic State fighters will not be halted with peaceful overtures and a plan for regional cooperation. They want complete control of the former Islamic lands and are willing to die for the cause. Are the flower-power Christians willing to put their lives on the line to try to talk them out of it? "
0,"[Watch] Louie Gohmert - We Have Barney Fife Running Our Feckless Foreign Policy Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) gives his views on the drifting, erratic and aimless foreign policy that was further highlighted by the recent Obama admission that we have no foreign policy in regards to the ISIS threat, Iraq and Syria. He says that exactly one year ago today, Obama was pressing Congress to bomb in Syria on behalf of what is now ISIS and credits some staunch Republicans and a few Democrats with preventing that from happening. He quotes Obama as saying we need to nip ISIS in the bud, adding, Its not in a bud its in full blossom, and then reminds us that that line was made famous by the character Barney Fife, saying, We have Barney Fife running our foreign policy now. Gohmert agrees that the press conference was lame, not only from the ISIS perspective but his comments on the economy and Ukraine. Rep Gohmert points out that under Obama, for the first time in history, 95% of the income went to the top 1%. That has never happened before in history. Rep Gohmert then raises Obamas assertion that Russia is more isolated than ever, saying, Are you kidding? They have been filling the void that this president has created around the world. I dont know where hes getting his information. Asked by Eric Bolling why we have to convince our commander-in-chief to act, Gohmert says that it supposedly took several months to convince him to allow a raid on Osama bin Laden and thirty days to attempt a Foley rescue. He points to the Obama tactic of fighting Russia on Twitter as more evidence of the Barney Fife nature of our foreign policy.

0,"Bernie Backer Threaten Chaos as Convention Kicks-off Ask any Democrat in Washington, Walls dont work, maybe not but it is probably a good thing that they put up an 8 feet high fence that stretches four miles long around their convention. Because at last count there were some 20,000 very upset Sanders Supporters that were planning on raising Hell at their convention this week. Already the dingy head of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, has submitted her resignation over the most recent flap contained in hacked emails, and Wiki-leaks has promised more to come that show a concerted effort on the part of the establishment to freeze out Sanders from the nomination. In fact in a statement over the weekend, the Wiki-leaks founder said that we havent seen anything yet and promised more emails that would sink Hillary Clintons chances for election in November. All this came as the Democrats begin Day One of their convention Monday still facing the potential for rowdy protests from Bernie Sanders delegates and supporters. Sanders supporters were angry over leaked emails that show the Florida congresswoman and her team blasting Sanders and discussing ways to undermine him, and have promised protests and demonstration aimed at disrupting the convention. While Debbies resignation could calm that storm, the liberal wing still appears intent on protesting over other grievances including Clinton, the partys presumptive presidential nominee, picking Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate. Norman Solomon, a Sanders delegate from California, said Sunday that Clinton picking acentrist like Kaine is an assault on the progressive agenda. He said the roughly 1,250 Sanders delegates connected to his Bernie Delegates Network are considering walking out during the Virginia senators expected acceptance speech at the Wells Fargo Center, and they are even looking into contesting his nomination. Clearly things are not as wonderful in the liberal party as the news media would have you believe. Solomon said their response reflects anger and disappointment over Clinton and like-minded Washington Democrats control over the party. We dont know exactly what to expect on the convention floor, Solomon also said. The uncertainty and rancor on several fronts puts the Democrats in a similar position as the Republicans when they entered their convention a week ago looking to soothe tensions between their presidential nominee and those who backed her primary rivals. But frankly, the clashes on the Democratic side have already outmatched last weeks fireworks in Cleveland, with Wasserman Schultz resignation standing as a stunning development on convention eve. The political spectacle already has distracted from the historic convention where Clinton is set to become the first female presidential nominee of a major party. As a result of the scandal, Wasserman Schultz has been largely sidelined from the convention though she will open and close it Sanders is set to speak Monday. In a written statement, he praised the DNC chairwoman for stepping down. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working peopleand young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race, he said. The resignation comes after WikiLeaks on Thursday released roughly 20,000 DNC emails, with more revelations emerging Sunday about Wasserman Schultz criticizing the Vermont senator to staffers. He isnt going to be president, she wrote in one May 21 email, also saying that Sanders vowing at the time to replace her as chairwoman was a silly story. But I guess it was not so silly based on the weekends events. In a major effort at damage control, Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson, on Sunday attempted to defend the fairness of the primary elections and said the DNC would conduct a full review of the emails. He said people should not jump to conclusions. After all, you should never believe what you see with your own eyes if youre a Democrat and always wait for the party leadership to tell you what to believe and to say because youre all idiots and incapable of making up your own minds. The DNCs impact in these things is minimal compared to the results. What candidates and campaigns spend and do on the ground, talking to voters day in and day out, thats what determines who wins, he said. Not to mention the Super Delegates that vote exactly the way that party officials tell them too. After all, Bernie had a 1200 delegate shortfall before the first vote was cast. Solomon suggested Sunday that the Sanders delegates frustration goes beyond the Kaine pick to include convention rules, climate change and the party platform, which they think fails to include enough of Sanders hard-fought progressive agenda. Starting on Sunday, the convention saw several large protests that took place near City Hall, in nearly 100-degree temperatures and under the watchful eye of city police officers. A lot of Democratic supporters labeled Bernie Sanders supporters conspiracy theorists. The WikiLeaks confirms what we thought all along, said Perry Mitchell, a 32-year-old Maryland who came to Philadelphia to participate in protests. Many of the early protests focus on concerns about clean energy. You see both parties are controlled by the oil and gas industry; those are the big donors, said Wendy Brawer a protester from New York City. But in a movement, you still have to do something to create change. Changing your lifestyle means youre part of the solution. People have to use less. It remains to be seen how the rest of the week plays out, but Mrs. Clinton is smack in the middle of the biggest scandal to hit her since Bill Clinton got caught lying to both congress and the American people about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky. But hey, as the presumptive nominee would probably say, at this point what does it matter? Fox News and the Associated Press contributed to this story. "

Hussein Obama had a phone conversation with the President of Mexico in which they discussed a variety of issues. Not on the agenda was the fate of Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi, who is still rotting in a Mexican Jail, almost four months after making the ultimate wrong turn and ending up a prisoner in the country next door which is quickly becoming one of our most threatening of enemies. Obama doesnt leave anyone behind, if he can free terrorist in exchange for them. No terrorists to trade means he doesnt have time for Sgt Tahmooressi; unless he suddenly turned gay in prison.

0,"War on Drugs: Senate Looking Into Reducing Prison Population Its one of the consequences of the war on drugs, the people of the Obama Justice Department and the ACLU tell the world. Prison overcrowding in the United States. All of those mandatory sentencing laws passed back in the 1980s and since have culminated into a whole lot of non-violent felons loitering in the halls of maximum security facilities, and that is making living conditions less than desirable. This problem has been pervasive for enough years that the United States federal government now spends a full quarter of the Justice Departments budget on maintaining federal prisons. Before the 2015 summer break, senators from both sides of the aisle were negotiating a deal to be sure that those who are arrested and convicted of drug offenses do serve some time, but will be given a legitimate shot at time off for good behavior. From the Daily Signal: They want to announce a deal as soon as they get back, but they just arent quite there yet, says Conn Carroll, the communications director for Sen. Mike Lee, a committee member and leading reform advocate. Lets just say its first and goal on the one, everyone thinks well score, we just dont know when, Carroll continued. The judiciary committees compromise bill is not expected to include reductions to mandatory minimums that are blamed for mass incarceration. Mandatory minimums require binding prison terms of a particular length and prevent judges from using their discretion to apply punishment. But the legislation is expected to give judges some leeway in sentencing drug offenders. All the cute football metaphors aside, it seems that the big bone of contention is the number of first-time, non-violent offenders serving incredibly long sentences which has been blamed on not having access to lawyers other than public defenders. Most reports on the prison overcrowding issue indicate that offenders arrested in the the suburbs have the money to be able to afford better lawyers. Of late, that had prompted the well to do Koch brothers to join the ACLU in lobbying Congress to address the problem. We think the criminal justice system needs reforms in a comprehensive way, says Mark Holden, general counsel and senior vice president at Koch Industries. Holden isthe right-hand man of conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch on the brothers push for criminal justice reform. The way the system is set up now, it is not working the way it should, Holden continued. You have a two-tiered system where if you are rich and well-connected, you end up OK. If you are poor, you wont. We are wanting to remove these obstacles. If you believe in the Bill of Rights, and against infringement of our rights, this is the place we need to be. Be that as it may, the truth is that the drug culture is destructive across the entirety of society. The question that needs to be answered for drug offenders who are on the list for time off with good behavior is have they learned their lesson? The Senate Judiciary committee headed by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is expected to produce a bill that takes pieces and parts from proposed legislation of the recent past and cobble together some sort of compromise between the live and let live crowd, and those who believe that fear of long prison terms is a deterrent to crime. Seriously though, unless parole and prevention is part of the package, its going to be just like everything else when the criminals are let back into society. A mess. "
0,"UNREAL! CNN Guest Blames Trump and Ben Carson for the Future Killing of Muslims! [WATCH] The Clinton news network (CNN) went too far yesterday when they attacked Trump and Ben Carson for recent comments made about Islam, or in Trumps case, his lack of comments. Rula Jebreal, an anti-American hate monger, was blaming the entire Republican party for being anti-Muslim. Apparently, if you believe that women should be treated equally and not like dogs (the way they are treated under Sharia law) that makes you anti-Muslim. Keep in mind Rula Jebereal is the same woman who defended the Muslim terrorists in Paris when they killed 11 innocent people and wounded 11 more during the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Rula Jebereal also blames America for radical Islam because ofthe U.S. invasion of Iraq during the Iraq War. So that gives you the idea of just how much intelligence we are working with here. At the end of her senseless ranting, Jebereal actually says if a gunman targets a mosque tomorrow, Carson and Trump will have blood on their hands. REALLY? So by that same logic, Obama already has the blood of murdered white police officers on his hands because of all his anti-cop rhetoric, right? Or better yet, ALL Democrats have the blood of the 5 Marines murdered in Chattanooga on their hands due to their refusal to condemn radical Islam. Somehow, I dont think she would agree with that. Like most liberals, she is a hypocrite. She insists that conservativesare wrong for judging all Muslims by the acts of a few (which we dont BTW). Yet she openly attacks the entire Republican party over the opinion of two Republicans. But if you call her out on her hypocrisy, you will be called a bigot. Liberalism truly is a mental disorder. "
0,"Parents Panic as 717 Kids Go Missing...JK! Angel Lomeli has four children who all attend John Adams Elementary School in Corona, California. A few weeks ago she says she was scared to death when she received four separate automated messages from the school telling her that her kids were not there. She wasnt the only parent to receive that message. Parents of a total of 717 elementary school students received the same message on the same day. Many dropped what they were doing, left work, and showed up at John Adamsonly to be told it was all a misunderstanding. According to Evita Tapia-Gonzalez, spokesperson for John Adams Elementary, the message was only supposed to be sent to a small, closed group of parents. Due to human error coupled with technology error, all parents received the message. Tapia-Gonzalez also told reporters and parents that the messages had been sent by accident via the Blackboard Messaging system implemented by the school. The parents were not amused. Human error is excusableincompetence is not. The fact that they didnt know and didnt immediately send out a broadcast text to correct the mistake as soon as it was discovered points to either incompetence or a complete lack of training. No one thought to start calling parents when some showed up at the school? "
0,"Feds Hit Mafia HARD! Dozens of Arrest Made in 5 States! In an early morning raid Federal authorities arrested more than 40 alleged Mafia members that stretch across five states. The charges are for racketeering, extortion, loan sharking, smuggling, arson, and gun trafficking. The 46 defendants tie into five major Mafia families: the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, and Bonanno families. Some accused mobsters belong to to the main Philadelphia family, according to a federal indictment that was unsealed in New York. According to Business Insider: Law enforcement agents swept up more than 40 defendants in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Florida, an FBI spokeswoman said. In a second indictment unsealed in Massachusetts on Thursday, two of the defendants were accused of working for the Genovese family and charged in a separate extortion scheme, along with three other members of the family. The New York defendants, with nicknames such as Rooster, Tony the Cripple and Mustache Pat, used violence, threats and the destruction of property to intimidate their neighborhoods, according to authorities. In one instance, several defendants attacked an individual they believed was panhandling outside a restaurant owned by one of the mobsters, using glass jars and steel-tipped boots, prosecutors said. In another incident, some defendants set fire to a car parked outside a rival gambling club. The various schemes extended from New York to Costa Rica, including running sports gambling rings, selling untaxed cigarettes and making fake credit cards, the indictment said.

0,"Common Core Exposed [WATCH] Dead White Guys And Second Amendment Lampooned In exposing the Common Core scam in education, Project Veritas took the same route as the Center for Medical Progress did to bring to light downright gruesome practices going on in the abortion industry. They went undercover. In three enlightening videos, Project Veritas shows the world that: Judge for yourself if these concepts are infuriatingly offensive. Project Veritas produced another video with more of the same less than a week later. It is available here. But it is the third video posted January 21 that has the most egregious interview so far. Breitbart was kind enough to provide a transcript of the dead white guys DOWN WITH FOX NEWS speech. Just to review: People that are not educated, Fox TV viewers think that Common Core comes from the educated liberal groups and thats why they are against it. They dont know anything about it. They think its liberal so theyre against it. Thats what I think it is. Its a knee jerk reaction. I did a big presentation yesterday for AP US History and the AP US History agenda was set, until Texas got upset about it and they wanted to have their founders they wanted founders in it. And its like come on. The dead white guys did not create this country. It was a whole bunch of different kinds of people. And yes there were women, and yes there were people of color, and yesyou need to talk about them too. But they want to talk about those dead white guys. And thats the problem. Youre getting pushback, because theres a bunch of Republican people, conservatives that dont like being told what to do by people they dont agree with. For example, in AP U.S. History a long time ago, Texas wanted to have U.S. History books, right? Pearson made them. And it talked about the Wild West and how there were prostitutes, right. And Texas was really upset. They didnt want to mentionIm likeYoure too young to Did you watch Gun Smoke? It was a TV show, and you had Marshall Dillon and Ms. Kitty was his friend. She owned a bar and she was a prostitute. They never mentioned it but thats what she was. Its like who was Ms. Kitty? Who were these people who went out and serviced these men that went out in the world? That was real. The Wild West was not a nice place. And our kids need to know that thats what it was like, you know. This writer will not argue that red light districts were a fact of life in the American westor anywhere else in the United States in her history. (Storyville in New Orleans, anyone?) Just like any other country, weve always had prostitution. And this writer will not argue that the workers who built the place were extraordinarily diverse. Anyone who knows their own family history in coming to America, that of the railroads, and the superficial survey of slavery we are offered in the U.S. knows that. However, the movers and the shakers, the men and women who got things done were largely white males. That reality doesnt change that these were the people who made things happen. As for the rest of KKs (as she is referred to in the Breitbart article), rant: the idea that the viewers of Fox News are pretty much ignorant hicks has been reinforced constantly for years in the leftist media. The data that supports this theory is at least three years old, and says that the people are 20 IQ points lower and misinformed. How this could be known definitively is a total mystery since no current statistics are readily available. Even the Wikipedia page is out of date. And newsflash to KK, a whole lot of us out here on the fruited plain have actually READ the U.S. Constitution all of it over and over, enough to be able to recite the parts that the leftists among us dont want to admit are there. Some of us have also read up enough on the history of Europe and the Americas to know that Islam is no friend to the west. Is that truth being taught, religion or not? What is really news worthy about the second video, though, is the acknowledgement from an educational textbook executive that Common Core is about taking control of education from local hands and making it national. Plank 10 of the Communist Manifesto says that a free education is to be available to all children. (Uh, taxpayers actually foot the bill for this, so technically it really isnt free.) Ms. KK, is that taught in Common Core? Just as an aside, why do liberals always go to birth control as a subject conservatives are supposedly afraid of? The earliest reference to that for me was in a Walter Lippmann book from 1925. And, really, what birth control actually prevents the spread of STDs? "

0,"Uh, Duggar Clan: Jesus Forgives, But Parents Need To Do Their Jobs To be perfectly honest, I never really watched 17 18 19 Kids and Counting. Being a cradle Catholic, and believing that God gives children to parents as He sees they can handle them, I have no real problem with big families, homeschooling or dressing modestly. Really. I dont. I do, however, have a problem with objectifying people who live this way, which is what I saw Jim Bob Duggar doing to his family with the television showright alongside enriching himself. As it turns out though, However Many Kids and Counting was most likely an evangelization tool for the Quiverfull movement. According to a rather spiteful Gawker post, the idea behind the Quiverfull people is: On the surface, Quiverfull follows your typical radical evangelical principlesevery word of the Bible is taken literally, traditional gender roles and family values are emphasized, and the secular world is alternately scorned and feared. But followers of Quiverfull take one key tenet and let it shape the rest of their beliefs: Birth control is evil. They want to have as many children as possible, in order to build a pint-sized fundamentalist Christian army. The Quiverfull movement takes its name from this verse from Psalm 127 (KJV): Lo, children are a heritage of the LORD: Each child is an arrow in their quiver, and theyre going to try to shoot it right at you. Leaving aside the birth control is evil crack (subject for another post, because Pope Paul VI was a prophet on that), this is a little scary. How are we supposed to convert people to Christianity if we dont step into the secular world and learn to speak of Christ in every day language??? Gender roles are just a bit subjective, and a patriarchal system somewhat defies the partnership marriage is supposed to be. In many Catholic families, but by no means all, regardless of the number of kids, MOM is in charge. She might wear a skirt and be soft-spoken, but make no mistake, MOM is in charge at least inside the house, and a smart dad will back his wife and vice versa. (This does cause conflicts, but they are usually resolvable.) But that is not the crux of this story. When it comes to the Quiverfull movement, it appears that come hell, high water, or accusations of a brother molesting his sisters, DAD is in control. DAD will intervene on his childs behalf, and find ways to deal with childhood failings. DAD relies on the forgiveness of Christ to deal with a sons criminal behavior, and that is just what Jim Bob Duggar did for his son Josh. He intervened and kept the young man from getting the psychiatric help he needed to deal with a fetish before it became a force for destruction for multiple girls opting for advice from the church elders and before going to the police. And that is the aspect of the Josh Duggar affair that can be laid directly at Jim Bobs door. It is also the aspect that other Quiverfull and Evangelical apologists are brushing off as if it does not exist. Just about every conservative piece written on this episode includes the we should not judge message. Sometimes it is in the comments, sometimes from the writer. As a believer in Christ who has brothers and who recognizes that young men are attracted to young women regardless of their relation at puberty, its not realistic to just say Jesus forgives if molestation occurs, and expect that to be the end of the matter if it becomes public. Yes, Christ told the woman at the well she was forgiven her sexual transgressions, but the second half of the sentence was to sin no more. Thats the part that needs more attention and calls for not a little bit of help. Getting help to overcome sexual issueswhy should anything be wrong with that? We accept that people of all ages need help with addictions to alcohol, drugs, gambling, pain killers, smoking, and much more. Why not sex, even if the attraction is natural, but unwanted? In Catholicism, we have multiple centers to deal with these addictions among priests. Admittedly, it doesnt always work and the priest ends up laicized. (Know or knew about five that have been, three before the Scandal.) Parents are encouraged to get their sons and daughters help when access to the booze cabinet becomes a problem. I personally know two young men who dried out before they graduated from high school. (If wed teach people how to drink in this country, this might not be an issue.) Why would a father who knows his son has reached puberty and has a libido difficult to control not talk to the kid about removing himself from temptation, send him off somewhere to military school, or at least have a sort ofgarconnire or bachelors quarters like the families of the FrenchSouth did on some of the plantations. In those families, young men were only allowed in the house for meals. Their parents knew darn well and good their sisters and cousins were going to start looking good to the boys, and took action before any hanky panky happened. Why should it be an issue in the United States for these young guys to live in a separate wing of a house from their sisters? Why would a father leave his precious daughters open to such abuse even if the abuser is a family member? Thats a failure to the daughters. No, it is not their fault that they were molested, contrary to popular belief. The Duggar girls do notdress provocatively, and they are fairly naive despite demonstrations from their parents and brothers if that is actually true. Their brother was not looking at them with anything other than male hormones. It happens. It happens everywhere and has for millennia. BUT, they were still under their fathers roof, which is why ultimately their vicitimization can be laid at his door, especially in an environment deliberately patriarchal. Yes, it is true as Mike Huckabee says, there is blood in the water and the people who oppose Evangelicals for whatever reason are hot to trot over this episode. There will be no recovery from it for the Duggars. But, what is more troubling is the excusing of Jim Bobs way of dealing with the issue. The man waited a year before talking to the church elders after the first allegation and did not even talk to authorities until another allegation was forwarded to the Department of Human Services from Oprah Winfreys studios when an accusation was made anonymously. Even then, the program Josh was sent to sounds to be more of a prayer camp than a place to learn how to cope with a strong libido. According to people who claim to be in the know not the least of whom is Jessa Duggars father-in-law Josh Duggar has repented. Maybe, and most likely so given the circumstances. He was a teenager and teens are not known for making good decisions. There have been no further allegations since 2006, and even for the ones that were known the statute of limitations had run out by the time they were reported to authorities. According to the Daily Caller and bordering on too much information, the incidents in question happened when all of the kids were sleeping in a common room. Now the boys and girls sleep in separate bedrooms. (Even my parents knew to do that.) Not a complete garconnire, but better than a common room for obvious reasons. That does not change the fact that Jim Bob Duggar tried to cover up his sons crimes. And they were crimes even if he was a minor at the time. According to multiple reports, two lawyers refused to defend Josh at the time. Given that he was a minor, that should say something. What Josh Duggar needed was a real parent. According to all the information available, he did not have all that good a one in Jim Bob. "
0,"Soros And SEX: What His Tax Returns Reveal Now that the headline has invoked irreversible imagery of George Soros andsexits time to talk about the latest of the Soros involved revelations making the rounds on alternative media. (The mainstream media wont touch it.) Well, somehow, The Washington Times got a hold of some old tax returns from George Soros and/or his bankrolled Foundation for an Open Society, and discovered that the Hungarian nation buster had quite the hand in the current culture fight over transgenderism, rest rooms, and discrimination. To ensure things ran full-steam ahead, billionaire George Soros, through his Foundation to Promote Open Society, dedicated at least $2.7 million to the cause that year, according to his tax returns. That was the year that the U.S. Supreme Court demonstrated to be influenced by other Soros connected non-profits ruled in favor of gay marriage by negating legislation and popular votes by the people of the states that held up natural traditional marriage of one man and one woman. At that point, social conservatives were a bit stunned by the ruling. The LGBT or Q or Trans or whatever these people choose to be, on the other hand, were of the CHARGE! mentality with swords drawn. (No pun intended. Happy accident.) I really do believe [the Supreme Court ruling] is the domino that is going to tip over the rest of the dominoes, Wilson Cruz, an LGBT activist, told CNN at the time. Do not get in the way of this train, because it will run you over. The Washington Times rightly points out that that year two of the most popular television shows, Glee and Modern Family, had prominent characters who were homosexual. This writer will say with absolute certainty that those two shows were just two in a long line of pop culture offerings that featured sexual disorders. Even as far back as the 1950s, there were veiled references to the lifestyle. It didnt really come out of the closet, as it were, until the 1970s with a spoof show called Soapwhich actually was funny aside from that subplot. The bedrock relationship of society child producing marriage was being softened up further thanks to the efforts of a billionaire. Usually this happens due to the children of such people being afflicted with a disorder, but in this casein this case, the old Hungarian just kept dumping cash into the effort with no indication of why. And then came 2016 and the great rest room debate. Defeating the traditional marriage votes in California meant that the LGBT crowd whatever the order of the letters now had a plan to attack other states. The target was put on the state of North Carolina. So what made North Carolina the tipping point? Well-funded LGBT organizers had success in California, giving them a blueprint to work in other states, and its an election year. North Carolina is a battleground state with presidential implications, and liberals love fighting the cultural wars. It was President Obama who lit the match, after all. The bathroom debate started in California, where the Gay Straight Alliance Network, an organization based in Oakland, has been lobbying hard for transgender rights. The group is a next-generation LGBTQ racial and gender justice organization that empowers allied youth leaders to advocate, organize, and mobilize an intersectional movement, according to its website. Essentially, its all about flipping North Carolina blue. At this point, the transgender people have organizations and clubs in multiple states. The Gay Straight Alliance has been pushing the issue all over the country, and yes, they were the recipients of $100,000 from Soros. But thats not all: The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Center also received $130,000 from Mr. Soros that year. Their Leadership Lab was published in the journal Science this spring, that evaluated the impact that door-to-door canvassing can have on reducing transphobia. Its being used as national model. The Leadership Lab writes the study has been able to independently quantify the impact were making on voters: The same decrease in homophobia that took fourteen years of incremental change to occur in the past is occurring here, in terms of voters transphobia, over the course of a single short conversation with a Lab canvasser. Whats more, their study shows that this approach is beginning to counter the heinous bathroom myth that our opposition has spread to scare voters into voting against the trans community in election after election. The Global Action for Trans Equality (GATE), headquartered in New York, received $244,000 from Mr. Soros. Its main purpose is to pull all the LGBT organizations together in order to create a louder megaphone, laying out best practices and fundraising advice. Mr. Soros also gave $525,000 to Justice at Stake, a group thats looking to promote diversity in the courts for people within the LGBT community. And the soft hearted liberals among us are buying the old mans agenda hook, line and sinker, making tradition, and common sense minded people seem like big meanies in comparison. (This writer has friends who are being played like violins.) And so it is how George Soros, the eighty something billionaire is forcing the sex lives of disordered humans on the rest of us. No one asked us girls if we wanted weirdo men dressed as women in our toilet facilities. We dont. Mr. Soros wants to convince us that we do. Thats what the culture wars are all about. "
0,"EPA Chief McCarthy Denies Environmental Lobbyists Participated in Crafting Regulations A New York Timesarticle, exposed that the land use and energy obstructionist lobbying group Natural Resources Defense Council basically authoredthe EPAs latest power plant regulations. That agenda-damaging revelationis now being denied by EPA chief Gina McCarthy. The revelation was made in a July 6tharticle, which asserted that the group had produced areportwhich was the blueprint for the regulations. McCarthy said the article, written by an experienced environmental reporter, Coral Davenport, was given surprising credibility. McCarthy characterized the assertion in testimony before lawmakers on Wednesday, saying, Its a discredit to [EPA employees] to suggest that this was designed by one group months ago. This is a result of hard work. That is not the same thing as saying it is not true, McCarthy herself and their agency could be considered a discredit to the original intentions of the agency. She offers the number of meetings rather than the substance of the report as evidence in attempting to refute the claims, saying, I have met many more times with utilities than I have with NRDC. One meeting in which she is handed a report to review would have been sufficient. She could have even completely avoided meeting with them and had one of her underlings deliver the report, but that would have made denying their influence even more suspicious. Republicans who have their eyes open to the EPAs shady dealings didnt accept her claims and responded with criticism of the agency for catering to wealthy liberal elites at the expense of ordinary Americans. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) said during the hearings, It is absolutely shameful to me that the EPA under the direction here of the Administrator, will allow this powerful group of lawyers and lobbyists to draft their regulations but yet this same Administrator refuses to actually listen to the people whose lives and jobs will be severely impacted by these regulations drawn up by wealthy lawyers and lobbyists. He continued, Lets be clear, the NRDC is a wealthy, elite, powerful lobbying machine with more influence over decision making in Washington than an ordinary American citizen. They have millions, which gives them access. The EPA has turned a deaf ear on those who dont. Davenports article exposed how a group which included both NRDC lobbyists and their select team of experts authored a 110-page coal-killing proposal which was adopted in virtual totality by the EPA in June of this year. Davenport also exposed how the NRDC was lobbying on behalf of their newly drafted guidelines prior to their adoption, in what would be consistent with acting on behalf of the EPA or under the belief that their recommendations were going to be adopted. It is no secret that the EPA is demonstrating a pattern of power consolidation measures and regulatory restrictions which will place it into the position of control over every aspect of American life. This will have a devastating impact of our foundation of liberty. If this is allowed to continue, the freedom and rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution will be subject to EPA approval. Our economic viability as well as the ability to heat and cool our homes and our freedom of mobility will be soon require McCarthys demonic blessing. The EPA makes claims to expand their power contingent upon a denial by Congress. Each time that denial does not take place, by a minimum of a fifty percent majority in each house, the EPA and Obama have succeeded in further degrading the freedom of the American people. The fact that the socialist McCarthy cant believe Republicans would object to that is further demonstration of the serious nature of the threat posed by the EPA and their push to incorporate UN Agenda 21 compliance into their regulations.

0,"Fleeing Suspect TRIPPED By Anonymous Pedestrian- Caught on VIDEO Some people lend a hand to law enforcement in times of need. One man, however, lent a foot. Police inEngland were chasing a suspect through the Kingston borough of London on Tuesday. They were attempting to arrest him for suspicion of drug possession with intent to sell. A security camera caught what happened next. As the suspect darted on to a sidewalk to evade the officers he came near a British man strolling with a woman. The man, seeing the plight of the policeman, took action. He casually extended his leg just as the criminal passed by. The timing was perfect. The suspect tripped and went sprawling across the cobbles. The members of Scotland Yard that were in pursuit, quickly caught up with and detained the alleged drug dealer. Though officials would like to thank the man who came to their aid, they can not. The man did not stay at the scene and his identity is unknown. Officer Sebastian Ellis told Sky News The video was brought to the attention of the Borough Commander this morning, who was very impressed and would like to meet him. So if you see this, please get in contact with me! The anonymous man is being hailed as a local hero for what police called his swift intervention. (It seems civilians are on a roll in the UK. Another man recently apprehended a mugger while dressed as Superman. No, really Superman.) At a London station, the Kingston suspect was booked and then released on bail. The thug is not due in court until early April. An investigation involving him is still ongoing. In the meantime, though, you can bet he is considering alternative meanings of Dont put a foot out of line. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox News "

0,"NFL Ratings Funk: America Speaks, Whole League Blaming Wrong Issue Whoever is running the National Football League and the affiliated sports reporting and programming needs to get in the now. After four straight weeks of what is described as alarming ratings drops of Americas top sports property, at least one sports outlet, Sports Business Daily, is somewhat recognizing that maybe politics is playing a role. See, back in 2000, during the Bush vs. Gore debacle, there was a similar drop in viewership. Not the double digit drops the NFL is seeing this season, but there was a significant drop across the board. Its not just the NFL. The Summer Olympics on NBC were down double digits in viewership from the London Games. ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball posted its lowest viewership average in at least a decade. Six NASCAR races from Aug. 21 to Sept. 25 logged double-digit viewership drops in race-to-race comparisons. Four prime-time UFC telecasts on Fox registered a combined 10 percent viewership drop this year. Could the answer be politics and a hotly contested presidential race that is eating up a lot of Americans free time? Maybe. But it could also be that in American culture, sports is meant as an escape from the world of politics. In the last few decades, politics has more than crept into sports. Based on the comments that people who care enough to leave on public commenting boards, that is a huge factor. And when it comes to the NFL, the league that seems to care more about profits than absolutely anything else, stomping on the fans love of country and their sacrifices for the security of the players on the field has left a very bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths. Hence, millions of people have found other things to do while the games are being played. (This writers father included. The man has not watched one minute of the NFL this season. Never thought it would ever happen.) Sunday Night Football, televisions highest-rated prime-time show for five years running, has seen a 10 percent viewership drop so far this season. Cables top sports property, Monday Night Football, is down 19 percent the series slowest start in a decade. Through two games, Thursday Night Football viewership is down 15 percent. There are some things that are acknowledged: there is more live streaming going on; many people no longer have cable, and head to another venue to watch; and, to an extent, the games are getting boring for one reason or another. (Lack of star quarterbacks is blamed by several people. Really?) Wellmaybe, but probably not. In the last three weeks, we out on the fruited plain who wont watch the National Felons League for one reason or another have exercised quite a bit of schadenfreude. Watching the people express their opinions the only way we really can not watching or attending games and in turn listening to the excuses from not just the league, but the sports writers has been fascinating. Just like the people in Washington, they are massively out of sync with the fan base. Yeah, with all the diluting of the talent base thats gone on with expansion, some sports have gotten boring. (Hockey, on the other hand, got better with the Europeans coming over to play here.) But what theyve really gotten to be is another way for individuals with a microphone to open their mouths about politics. Thats not why fans tune into sports, and pro football in particular. When the NFL high brass and sports writers figure that out, come and talk to us. Until then, We the People encourage Proctor and Gamble to pull Tide advertising from the NFL. Thats one product several of us would like to not have to boycott. "

She has one of those awkward moments where she seems to have gotten lost in her thoughts. She entered the race late and there is a lot of programming that has to be remembered. Even Jackie Chan forgets his lines sometimes. The problem for Curtis is that it happened during a live interview. The episode really isnt much different from her what fellow Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, does in the House with regularity, and the look is very similar. As a Democrat, it may not be much of an issue.

How do they do that other than with bombs and bullets? Dr. Bill Warner explains: ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. Throughout the history of Islamic takeovers, this propensity to destroy existing culture is part of the modus operendi of destroying a civilization mind, body and soul. That is how so many great cathedrals in Spain were knocked down and replaced with Mosques only to have them turned back to cathedrals when the marauders were sent packing. This is why there are so many complaints against bacon and pork products in the west. This is why Muslims tear down Cruxifixes in public spaces. This is why we are being guilted at every turn to be tolerant toward people who are not tolerant toward us. This is why we cannot give in to the threats, guilting and bullying as has been tried in the United States of late all over the country.

0,"Pimp BLM Leader Arrested For Sex Trafficking, Guess What Obama Does? Charles Wade, one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter movement, was arrested for human trafficking and pimping. The victim was a 17 year old girl who Wade hired out and used for prostitution. He was spotted at a Howard Johnson Hotel paying for a room for the young girl, then leaving the Hotel room. A FBI agent went undercover and called a number Wade had listed in a local newspaper ad for an escort service. The agent took the offer, went in the hotel room, found the 17 year old wrapped naked in a towel asking him if he wanted oral and vaginal sex. Wade owned 3 phones and his job as a BLM leader was to call and collect funds, donations, money for the BLM activists and other black social protest movements. He said he uses the money to put up out of town activist in hotels and feed them while theyre joining in protest demonstrations. He gets $25,000 a week. Coincidentally, thats the exact amount he paid to the bail bondsman to get out of jail. Our President, Commander and Chief Obama, just invited this pervert to our White House a few days before the arrest . Obama was obviously interested in Wade because he was franchising activists groups like the BLM. He was offered to do a movie screening there with other BLM activist, they planned on doing a documentary of some kind about his charitable, social justice activities. Of course, the White House didnt respond to comment on his visit when asked by The OReilly Factor. Apparently they havent thought of a good lie yet to explain why this dirt bag wasnt thoroughly screened before his visit. First Obama invites illegal aliens to our White House and now sex traffickers! Is thisthe transparency that Obama promised to give us? If so, his transparency is black.

0,"Ted Cruz Fundraising Off Suicide Speech By now even the most die-hard Ted Cruz supporter has to admit that hes shown himself as a shameless exploitative hypocrite. He demonstrated that to the world last night at the Republican National Convention but he went one step further. He followed his disgusting display with a little old fashioned Texas Panhandling, or more correctly, Canadian Cash Hustling, on the strength of his Cleveland performance. Cruz sent out the following fund-raising letter after his speech, perhaps unable to see the magnitude of the self-inflicted wound. Ironically, the anonymous political villain hes describing in the first paragraph sounds exactly like him. Asking people for money to fight against people like himself is going to be a tough sell. The recipients included Dennis Michael Lynch, not one of his biggest fans, who posted it on his site. It was an honor to speak to the delegates at the Republican National Convention. As our cause goes forward, I want to remind you about the stakes. Americans are furiousrightly soat a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and ignores the will of the people. One might wonder just what that cause is hes referring to as he makes no effort to explain it, but its going forward, and he needs our help. The stakes are high and the American people are furious, as they demonstrated on Wednesday night, with establishment politicians who break their promises. Pledges are promises and Cruz is himself ignoring the will of the very people he made mention of. But there is a better vision for our future: a return to freedom. If we choose freedom, our future will be brighter. Freedom will bring back jobs and raise wages. Freedom will lift people out of dependency and to the dignity of work. 47 years ago today, America put a man on the moon. Thats the power of freedom. Our party was founded to defeat slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. We passed the Civil Rights Act, and fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws. Those were fights for freedom, and so is this. Will you stand with me by making an immediate donation $5, $10, $25, or whatever you can afford today? So supporting Ted Cruz is synonymous with choosing freedom? Crafting the text of a speech which was such a roundly derided failure, labeled by many to have been political suicide, into his letter shows that while Calgary Ted might be intelligent, he is one stupid son of gun. Its like shooting yourself in the foot and then, realizing youre having trouble walking and in tremendous pain, deciding to shoot the other foot to balance things out. He added, This fight has never been about a particular candidate or campaign, but because each of us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids, that we did our best for their future, and for our country. Chip in $5 Chip in $10 Chip in $25 Chip in $50 Cruz certainly made it appear it was all completely about one candidate on one campaign, him and his own. The political parasite never does explain how giving him money is going to help fix things. Its kind of the same formula as giving money to the UN to keep the planet from warming. Its the Just shut up and donate model. We must make the most of our moment to fight for freedom, to protect our God-given rights, even of those with whom we dont agree, so when we are old, and our work is done, we will be able to say, Freedom matters, and I fought to save it. I promise to lead the fight for freedom and our liberty every day from the United States Senate. We can do this. But I cant do it without you. For liberty, Ted Cruz For the bottom line and continued power Heidi hasnt gone back to Goldman Sachs fulltime yet and theyre struggling to make ends meet on his $196k yr salary.

0,"Trump Supporter Almost Gives Soros Clinton Thugs What Theyve Got Coming The disrupting agitators who attend Trump rallies with the sole objective of creating a disturbance and interrupting the event arent among the elite of society by any measure despite being used as a tool of the elite establishment. Theyre merely below average, invasive parasites, although capable, just barely, of basic arithmetic calculations. Armed with that modest skill set, they should be able to determine that if push comes to shove they are hopelessly outnumbered. The ratio is something along the lines of 2,000:1 against them in a standard Trump crowd of ten thousand, not good odds for the Soros boys. Thats the kind of numbers that could land them in a hospital room or a morgue if they push the wrong group of perturbed persons buttons. Trump supporters are good people by and large who just want to support their candidate, but they are also out of patience with the instigators unprovoked attacks as paid agents of the Democrats and George Soros. There was a time in this country when if someone attacked you there was no second guessing, you instinctively and immediately fought back. Now, rather than defending ourselves, we have been conditioned by the leftists to dial 911 and let someone else protect me. That mentality is not healthy and it lets the bad guys get away with many offenses. It is part of the political correctness that has poisoned this nation. The prosecution of victims as aggressors is a tool the left uses to intimidate us into not responding to their attacks. More and more people have had enough of tolerating these assaults. There response is tolerate this you POS. This man at the Trump rally appears to be one of them. Although its unknown what is being said, whether one or more of these lowlife punks assaulted or spit on the Trump supporters, its clear that many of the people surrounding the action are incensed with the agitators. The one gentleman is aching to give them what they have coming. The sneering disrupters are using the typical methods of the left, taunting and daring the good, regular Americans to respond. It would have been interesting and sent the proper message to the leftist trash if thirty or so of the Trump supporters had unleashed themselves and pummeled the crap out of this group of soft, morally bankrupt pimples. It would not have been a wise move, as some would surely end up being arrested, put it is what they deserve. There comes a time when the American people have to stand up and say no more. Thats what the middle class, average American is saying in supporting Donald Trump, No More. Its not a stretch for them to expand that to their interaction with paid thugs sent in to provoke them. If the price of admission for the Soros Clinton agents includes getting the daylights beaten out of them and an even more toothless smile, the tactics may have to be abandoned. You hear the girl in the first video of the altercation at the rally almost in horror that the Trump supporter responded to physical taunts in kind. Theyre used to watching self-restrained Trump people letting the thugs get away with their assaults. That may now be how things work anymore. The old ways can be seen in the second video. The turn the other cheek while you beat the snot out of me, with the police ordered to do nothing by Democrat city leaders approach hasnt worked out so well in the past. The incident below is from August, in Minneapolis, but theres no shortage of examples in which Trump supporters have been left to fend for themselves.

They discuss the apparent obstruction by the Justice Department as it pertains to their stalled criminal inquiry or discovery or pursuit of evidence of wrong doing which took place. Her organization is working with the FBI to provide as much information as possible to assist in their investigation. Many believe the supposed investigation by the Justice Department is a sham, and that it is being conducted in such a manner as to minimize their findings and the subsequent damage to individuals involved. Engelbrecht says that she hopes we are going to get to the truth, but all of this, this whole process is based upon the supposition of honor, and that everybody really does want to find out what really happened. And to the degree that thats not true, then its going to continue to be the stonewall that you see playing out right now.

0,"Michael Savage - Obama And Beyonce Leading America To End Of Our Civilization Michael Savage is usually pretty spot on in his assessment of the state of affairs in America, but he makes one small but still significant misstatement in his rant about the connection between Beyonce and Hussein Obama. He refers to Obama as our president, which is incorrect. Obama does not have the necessary qualifications for that office, which he has only been able to obtain and retain through deception. Beyond that point, Savage bemoans the trashy, sleaziness of not just the occupants of the building which is the traditional home of our leader, but how the dignity of and respect for the structure itself has been seriously compromised by the filth weve allowed to defile it. Savage notes the contortions of those who have been invited into the White House, imitates sexual acts and are foul mouthed embraces of the most brutal and disrespectful treatment of women. Its okay, though, as long as Donald Trump didnt say it, Democrats have no objections. Savage says, Jay-Z and Beyon-ce have visited the so-called White House several times. Beyon-ce, who is beyond reason, who is extolled as a role model to young girls, including Im sure the Obama daughters, sings songs like this: When he f me good I take his a to Red Lobster, cause I slay. If he hit it right I might take him on a flight, in my chopper.' Isnt that classy, notes Savage. Isnt it great to see Western civilization knocked off its pedestal and replaced by this filth? So Obama has no opened up the door and ushered in the absolute destruction of Western civilization. As he said there are no more standards because stars and stripes forever is dead. Down the road that Obama is ushering us, says Doctor Savage, There is no more red white and blue that is bringing us together. It is all black against white and you have to take sides.

0,"Second Amendment, Baby: One Nation Importing Americas Gun Culture It looks like more people out there than just Americanconservatives have noticed that guncontrol laws just dont work. In fact, one of our neighbors to the south not only noticed but have decided to adopt our ideal that an armed society is a polite one. From the OrangeCounty Register: pro-Second Amendment arguments are familiar to us here in the United States, but the more guns, less crime experience of the U.S. is being trumpeted in a somewhat unlikely place: Panama. The Central American nation has been struggling with rising crime, gang activity and forged gun permits. In order to address these problems, and promote personal safety, the government is preparing to lift its ban on firearms imports, in place since 2012, so that citizens may better defend themselves. Everything seems to indicate that there is no direct correlation in the aphorism that says more guns mean more crime, said Mr. Aguilera, who cited the 20-year decline in the homicide rate in the U.S. as gun laws have simultaneously been relaxed. Other than in the few bigcities where guncontrol laws are REALLY strict to be honest. In those places the homicide rate is off thecharts bad. In the states whereconcealedcarry is a way of lifehomicide drops to near the bottom world-wide. Panama adopting a gunculture insofar as they will allow their people to keep and bear arms for protection, is but one nation bucking an international movement that starts with the United Nations trying to assert supremacy over the entire world. It is not acharging movement, but it is a start, and should be applauded. By definition,criminals are willing to break the law. Guncontrol will not stop that. But weapons in the hands of thecitizens will keep the people from being sitting ducks for the people whoconsidercrime a way of life. "
0,"Trumps Message To Muzzled Majority - I Am Your Voice Donald Trump explains that Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change. The status quo that she is largely responsible for creating works quite well for her. It even has her positioned above the law, accountable to nobody, including the American people she seeks continued rule over. In contrast, his message is that things have to change and they have to change right now. He says, Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. I have visited the laid off factory workers, he says, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten. But theyre not going to be forgotten long. These are people that work hard but no longer have a voice. Trump pledges, I am your voice. Hillary Clinton is in the unenviable position of defending her disastrous record in a time of economic hardship in which the news of how bad things really are is being suppressed by the media. Donald Trump isnt going to play that game. Hes already promised to tell the American people the truth hes going to be doing so during the general election campaign as well as the debates. The truth that the Democrats and complicit Republicans have been hiding is about to be revealed. Its going to blow up all over Hillary Clinton. That voice that Trump is giving to the American people is her worst nightmare. He already began, notably in this speech, by highlighting the misdeeds of the Democrat regime, including Mrs. Clinton. Their impact on Americans has included stating artificially low unemployment figures, the flooding of the nation with illegal aliens and threatening, dangerous refugees from terrorist nations. There is a broad spectrum of actions that enrich and empower the few while disenfranchising and impoverishing the masses. Clinton is in for a rough couple of months that she is quite deserving of.

0,"[Watch] Mike Huckabee Blasts Obamas Recreation and Party Ethic, Work Ethic Substitute Mike Huckabee compares his background and the jobs hes held in his life, his work ethic to what is little more than a recreation or leisure ethic on the part of the occupant of the White House. The former governor describes how he puts completing the job ahead of what the clock says, working where and how is needed to get the job done, and a lack of leisure or vacation time as the way things have been for him. He credits his father with teaching him to give his best to whatever job he has. Show up early, stay late and never be asked but once to get something done. Those values seem obvious and natural to many of us. They are also increasingly foreign to a large percentage of Americans and other guests, invited or otherwise, in our nation. Huckabee says hes been watching our federal government and has come upon the realization that, By gosh, Im a sucker. He continues, I mean, Im working long hours and long days to pay for the people in Washington to take a long vacation. He says hes sometimes asked if hell make another run at the presidency and hes concluded it might be a nice reprise from the kind of hours hes putting in now. He describes Obama as simmering and summering over at Marthas Vineyard, adding to his 186 rounds of golf since becoming president. He remarks that if he became president, he might finally have time to take up golf or get back into some fishing, play more music, even host lavish parties at the White House with Hollywood celebrities that last late into the night. He asks what about the job, when so many Americans dont have a job, when Christians and others are being slaughtered by ISIS, when our dysfunctional and corrupt government is targeting and spying on citizens. Huckabee closes saying, I dont begrudge a president for taking some time off, but to take repeated exotic vacations at taxpayer expense while millions of Americans dont have enough money for a minor league baseball ticket and a hotdog because weve got a lousy economy, it just seems unseemly. He adds, I mean, if president Obama doesnt want to do the job, whyd he work so hard to get it? He got what he wanted; he just doesnt seem to want what he got. And neither do the American people.

0,"Julian Assange Got The Better of This Exchange CNN talking head Anderson Cooper is doing his best to take the attention away from the damaging content of the hacked emails and the lack security that resulted in the hack by trying to make it a personal vendetta by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange against the human security breach, Hillary Clinton. As a totally bought and paid for shill for the leftist establishment, Cooper appears to have a hard time grasping the concept that Assange is acting purely in service to the public interest with his releases. Hes exposing to America a few of the many improprieties, irregularities and criminalities of much of the Democrat leadership. The part that seems to get to him the most is that which involves Hillary Clinton the grim reaper of American liberty. The last thing Cooper and his Democrat masters need is another guy who cant be bought. Attempting to torpedo Donald Trump was already more than a full time job for their entire network, as well as MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, much of print and online as well as the entertainment world. Thats a lot of firepower against one guy and his campaign. Now Assange has emerged out of nowhere, throwing curveballs that they might not be able to hit. Cooper asks Assange if there is more information to come, doing a fair job of masking his bias initially. Mr. Assange replies, We have more material related to the Hillary Clinton campaign, it is correct to say that. Assange has seen Cooper in action before so he tells him he has to be very precise in his language, his choice of words, because youre always very precise. He says the yet unreleased documents are extremely interesting and we will see what will come of them in due course. Thats what he was afraid Assange was going to say; its time to attack. Cooper plays the role of Clinton defender, saying, There is a question whether you had a personal animus toward Hillary Clinton. Youve criticized her on a number of national security, foreign policy issues obviously; she has obviously made statements against Wikileaks. You gave an interview to the British network ITV back in June. You suggested you were more concerned about Clinton, at least in terms of press freedom, than Donald Trump. Do you stand by that; is this based upon a personal animus? Assange says those claims are false reporting. I never said I wanted to harm Hillary Clinton, anything like that, it was the presenter that used that word. The New York Times has picked its candidate in this race and so it distorts the facts to try to get its candidate up. Cooper attempts to lower the nature of the releases to retaliation by Assange and fails miserably. All he does is make himself look like a petty, wholly owned tool of the DNC. He said, So the question of anger, that youre interfering in the US election, youre saying that your readers are American and therefore its okay? Thats a most idiotic, inane question, implying that Clintons criminal activities and those of her cohorts cant be reported on except in the country of her offenses? Does CNN not have an international news division? Assange, being the gentleman that he is didnt point out the clumsy way his questioner attempted to diminish him and kept on point. The response involves some concepts that surely had Anderson Coopers head spinning, like honest reporting and principles. Assange said, Well, its what our readers demand but its also our basic principles. The publication of true information, and thus important qualifier, true information about moderninstitutions allows us to understand what theyre doing and therefore to reform them. He continues telling the apparently befuddled Mr. Cooper, If we dont understand what our institutions doing we have no hope to reform them whatsoever. Cooper missed multiple opportunities to hone his investigative skills when Hussein Obama was inserting himself into the Israeli elections to attempt to unseat Benjamin Netanyahu. But he works for Obama as well, so just like everything else Obama and Clinton get a pass and the little twerp comes out attacking the good guys who are exposing corruption and bias. Isnt that what Cooper and the rest of the media are supposed to be doing? Clearly he could learn a lot from Julian Assange and Wikileaks as we all are about to learn a lot from them, about Hillary Clinton. "

According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? "
0,"Boehner Finds His Spine, Invites Netanyahu To Address Congress On Iran The teleprompters had barely powered down from Barack Obamas sixth State of the Union Democratic applause fest, when John Boehner, the beleaguered Speaker of the House of Representatives, fired one heck of a shot across the administrations bow when it comes to foreign policy and bowing and scraping to Iran. From Associated Press via HotAir: House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday he had invited Israels prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress next month about the threats from Tehran and radical Islam. The Republican leader released a letter extending the invitation to Benjamin Netanyahu for Feb. 11. Well, alrighty then. If anyone speaks plainly and eloquently about Iran and what they are up to it is Mr. Netanyahu. And Boehner did it without consulting the White House which is a sort of breach of protocol, too. The White House usually does a lot of negotiating before an invitation is issued. But, surprise, surprise, surprise, that isnt all the news on John Boehner defying Obama. There was the Speakers response to Obamas threats regarding sanctions against Iran: Boehner also told a private meeting of GOP lawmakers that Congress would proceed on new penalties against Iran despite Obamas warning that any legislation would scuttle diplomatic negotiations over the countrys nuclear program. You may have seen that on Friday, the president warned us not to move ahead with sanctions on Iran, a state sponsor of terror, Boehner told colleagues, according to his office. His exact message to us was: Hold your fire. He expects us to stand idly by and do nothing while he cuts a bad deal with Iran. Two words: Hell no! This statement came from the purported wet noodle hours after Barack Obama proclaimed this in front of the entire government (except the Supreme Court conservatives who found other things more important than witnessing Obama make an idiot of himself). New sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating America from its allies, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesnt make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. As Democratic representative Bob Menendez tweeted, The more I hear from the administration the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran. No kidding. Multiple lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling Obama on his assertions that the Iranian nuclear program has been halted. According to the HotAir sources, they are willing to openly challenge him on it, too. In the meantime, one must marvel at John Boehners masterstroke, as Ed Morrissey put it, of bypassing the administration on foreign policy sanctions and going straight to our most steadfast ally in the region for answers on Iran. Maybe now the long game will begin to play out. Yuck. If anyone speaks plainly and eloquently about Iran and what they are up to it is Mr. Netanyahu. If anyone spoke plainly and eloquently about Israel it was Ahmadinijad. Have him speak for BALANCE. What do you mean spine? The only thing this guy can be counted on is supporting that left-wing criminal welfare state called Israel. They should BOTH be arresed Boehner for treason and Nuttyahoo for espionage, stealing from the US (see Project Pinto.) "
0,"Operation Choke Point Victims Get Grievence Airing On Capitol Hill This Afternoon Of all the dirty stunts the Obama Administration pulled so far during his tenure, the nastiest, and most unAmerican has arguably been Operation Choke Point, the Justice Departments program that leans on the nations banks in order to get them to cut off objectionable businesses from avenues of banking and money flow. After years of stories surfacing that legitimate and successful businesses lost their banking relationships to this outrageous program, a hearing will occur on Capitol Hill with the HouseFinancial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. They will question FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, and hear stories from business owners caught in Operation Choke Points mousetrap. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., calls Operation Choke Point the greatest government overreach that no one is talking about. Many Americans agree. From the Daily Signal: The Justice Department maintains it has no interest in pursuing legal industries, but since then, the program has come under fire by Republicans in Congress for blocking many legal but politically unpopular business owners, like firearms and ammunition sellers, from the financial sector. These are the business industries known to be under fire: As most people concluded when this list surfaced, there are several types of businesses there that are either unethical or unsavory, but not illegal. If we as a culture and country do not like the presence of those businesses, laws need to be changed. The Justice Department has no call to try to close these enterprises on their own. Todays hearing will reportedly feature victims of Operation Choke Point who have made their stories known. We will see what Capitol Hill testimony will do to change the situation. "
0,"WATCH: Bill Nye, Science Guy Makes An Idiot Of Himself On Reproduction Not that this writer had all that great an affinity for Bill Nye anyway, but the video below has to be the most smug, snide, atheistic diatribe displaying outright willful ignorance and leftist talking points to grace youtube at least since Hillary Clinton talked about this subject. Ignoring the crack that the Bible is 5,000 years old, since the oldest parts of the Hebrew Septuagint are about 3,500 years old and the last book of the New Testament was written toward the end of the first century A.D. (that means Anno Domini, or the year of Our Lord), and the fact that a whole lot of characters of consequence in the Good Book were born to a women who really should never have conceived by the laws of nature, shall we talk about the science involved in human reproduction? Over at National Review, a trio of physicians pick apart the arguments using actual peer reviewed medical journal articles, but we can sum up what they have to say pretty easily. This is the pure science of when human life begins. It is true that not every time an egg is fertilized it implants, and babies are lost due to natural causes every day. This is called an act of God, or if one is not religious, Mother Nature. Mr. Nyes statements on that topic calling for the prosecution of women whose fertilized eggs do not implant in the uterine wall are patently stupid on their face. You wouldnt know how big a human egg is if it werent for microscopes. Uh, Billthe human ovum is the only sort of cell in a womans body that can be seen with the naked eye. It is true we would not know the gory details of the beauty of human reproduction without medical doctors putting cameras in some pretty private parts of women, but that does not cancel out the actual science itself that tells us a human being is created at fertilization. Bill Nye might be a science guy (engineer, actually), but hes no more an expert on human reproduction than Todd Akin is. What Nye is is a leftist tool who is spouting the feminist line that simplifies down to stupidity the excuses the left offers for why abortion should be tolerated in polite society, and why abstinence is undesirable as a way to prevent pregnancy when it is really 100% reliable as a way to do so. Without medical intervention, so far as we know, only one child was ever conceived without his mother knowing man. That has to say something for God. "

This time, however, its not from Hillary Clintons email. Its from her official, State Department calendar. It would appear that someone forgot to record meetings with Clinton Foundation contributors,loyalists, and longtime political donors, along with corporate and other outside interests. One or two omissions could easily be an innocent mistake. The 75 unrecorded meetings that the AP has already uncovered, though, is a bit more suspect. Getting access to the information took a federal lawsuit. Once the facts were in hand, a comparison was made between planning schedules supplied by Clinton aides in advance of each days activities and the 1,500-page historical record of Clintons daily events as Secretary of State. It turns out that there were major differences. As to who and what was deleted or omitted, lets take a look. By the numbers: Hillary deleted again? photo:angrycritter Hillary, and her staff, are already under investigation for their handling of government info. This new revelation casts further doubts on the supposed transparency that she keeps touting. It also calls into question the reason for the names and events being deleted or left out in the first place. The excuses, of course,already being offered. None of them, however, account for all of the problems already detected in just the 1/3 of her schedules released, thus far. Im sure Hillary will take a moment out of her busy schedule to explain the issue. Maybe the press conference to do so will even get recorded on her calendar. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: Fox News "
0,"Border Patrol Agent - Wall Will Work But Must Have President That Wants Security National Border Patrol Council Local President Hector Garza is interviewed regarding the situation at the border, a discussion which is led off by a clip of Donald Trump laying out his immigration plan in Phoenix last Wednesday. Host Uma Pemmaraju asks him to characterized the situation in light of the claims that the Obama regime makes of increased levels of deportations. Garza debunks those claims by pointing out that 80 percent of those intercepted crossing into the United States are allowed to remain, in addition to the many who are able to evade capture altogether. He points to the limited resources that the Border Patrol is given with which to do their difficult jobs, including not enough vehicles, manpower and infrastructure. He describes key elements of the infrastructure as proper roads along the Rio Grande, communication towers so that agents can talk to each other, as well as the proper weapons and technology, including tower cameras. Agent Garza details how through Obama executive orders and their abuse of prosecutorial discretion, most of the people that they apprehend end up being released into the country and are not deported. He addresses the problem of limited manpower making it very difficult to adequately patrol the border. He says, Keep in mind that if we dont have enough agents out there theres going to be people that are going to get away and we do not know who those people are. He states the problematic truth, The only people that we know who were catching is the ones that were actually catching. But guess what, theres a lot of people that were missing and theyre coming into the country undetected and we do not know who they are. They may be people that are coming to work, they may be cartel members or they might be terrorists. We dont know. Garza describes some of the unnecessary, regime-created difficulties that agents must deal with, saying, As a border patrol agent, if youre assigned to a specific area along the border and you do not have the proper manpower and you do not have the proper infrastructure and the roads to get to specific areas along the border, youre pretty much committing suicide if you go to a specific spot. Regardless, our agents still go out there, they try their best, but its a losing battle and its very difficult for everybody. And its not safe, Garza notes. Its irresponsible, its reckless and we should do something about it. Hes asked whether a wall would be effective as a deterrent. He replies, So yes, Uma, a wall would work and would be a deterrent. He explains that in building a wall, Not only are we creating a physical barrier along the border, but also were going to bring that infrastructure and Ill give you an example. Right now our agents dont have the ability to have lateral movement along the border. And its very difficult for us to actually patrol and secure the border because they dont have roads. We dont have the technology. He summarizes, So when we talk about border security, yes, a wall will work, but we also have to make sure that we have proper manpower, that we have the technology, communication towers. But most important of all, Uma, we have to make sure that we have an administration that wants to secure the border. We know who Agent Garza will be voting for in November. "
0,"(WATCH) 911 Operator Tells Little Girl To Stop Whining During Tragedy When tragedy strikes, who do you call? 911 is the first thought. A 13-year-old girl did just that after being involved in a car accident that killed her father. Rick Warrick and his family were driving to Dave Busters to get a bite to eat. Warrick had his fianc, Julia Pearce, and his two children with him. On the way to the restaurant, they got a flat tire. Warrick and Pearce got out of the vehicle to change the tire on theMaryland highway and while they were finishing up, an oncoming car hit them and speed off, leaving them laying on the side of the road. Warricks 13-year-old daughter then called 911 in a panic. She was on the phone with a 911 operator while her father lay there dying on the side of the road. It seemed like it couldnt get any worse, but it did. As expected, the teen was in a panic. Who wouldnt be? Youd expect the 911 operator to have some compassion, but he didnt. How he handled the situation was reprehensible and sickening. Here is how some of the conversation went: Are they breathing? asks the male dispatcher. Yes, I think so, can you all hurry up please? said the teen. Maam listen, lets stop worrying about hurrying up and get there. Were already on our way, said the dispatcher. Theyre just laying here, cried the teen. Is there someone else there I can talk to because its so hardOK, lets stop whining. OK, lets stop whining, its hard to understand you. The dispatcher goes on to ask the young girl several times as to why her father was lying on top of his fianc, and she tearfully responds with that is just the way he landed. The dispatcher seemed to get frustrated with her during the call, not caring about how traumatic the situation was for her. How heartless can you be? He never asked how old she was, he just called her maam. Warrick was killed and Pearce was seriously injured. There are no leads on who the driver was who hit them. The dispatcher is under investigation for the way he handled the call, and has been reassigned to a position away from the public. Capt. Russ Davies, a spokesman for the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said, 911 dispatchers are trained to take control when they have a hysterical caller to focus them, but how (the dispatcher) proceeded to do that doesnt meet our expectations of how that would occur. This is not how I would like to be treated if I called 911, he added. What do you think should be done to the dispatcher? Should he be allowed to continue to work as a dispatcher or should there be a severe consequence to his cold and cruel handling of the call? Listen to the snippet of the 911 call and tell us what you think? Did he handle it appropriately or not? "

0,"House Bill Restrains Refugee Russian Roulette, Gives Rights To Citizens For those who fear the United States could devolve into the same type of chaotic mess that Europe has become and who find it asinine to import unvetted terrorists, a glimmer of hope has appeared on the political horizon. On Wednesday the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to markup the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act (HR 4731), which is designed to restore self-determination to states and local governments in matters related to federally sanctioned human trafficking, the importation and dumping of foreigners by the federal government. States and local governments would be legally able to refuse to accept foreign refugees within their jurisdictions Under the current system, the State Departments nine contracted domestic resettlement agencies make the decisions as to which of 190 locations get saddled with the terror threats and the social problems. No input, agreement or informing of the impacted citizenry has been required. The bill also gives Congress the authority to reduce the overall refugee ceiling nationally to 60,000, down from its current level of 85,000 and climbing. A president would not be able to add to the number without congressional approval. The unilateral waiving of grounds of inadmissibility and deportability by a dictatorial and corrupt DHS Secretary would be specifically prohibited. There is also a requirement for federal officials to prioritize those asylum claims made by refugees who are fleeing religious persecution from countries designated as being of particular concern by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Basically what the bill does is remove the subject avenues of abuse the Democrats have created in the pursuit of social and demographic engineering. House Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee Chairman and bill co-sponsor Raul Labrador (R-ID) said, To continue Americas long history of welcoming those in need, we must restore confidence in the safeguards protecting our security. Predictably, the open borders, anti-white lobbies denounced the bill based upon the typical false claims that it was punitive, mean-spirited, and would dismantle the U.S. refugee program. Their destructive agenda comes first, even ahead of national security. One of those agencies presently enjoying a financial windfall from the destruction of America, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, now rebranded as HIAS, complained, It ties the hands of the U.S. government to respond to humanitarian crises. Of course the crisis theyre really concerned with is the financial one it will create for their organization. Their spokesperson, Melanie Nezer, was also critical of the provision that strips refugee status from those returning to their native land and another that extends the time period before a refugee can apply for permanent resident status by two years. Nezer, who is accustomed to dictating what Americans will accept whether they like it or not, stated that those changes were enacted for no legitimate reason. Recognizing the effect of the prioritizing requirement, Nezer also complained that placing a preference on those in certain religious minorities who are in actual physical peril would hinder our ability to take in anybody. It will hinder their ability to take in dollars. Maybe the government and their contractors shouldnt have been abusing the system and the American people in the first place and Congress wouldnt have felt compelled to take corrective action. The bill is being roundly criticized by all of the supposed religious refugee agencies who earn in the area of $4,755 per resettlement for their efforts, although none of them has the integrity to state the loss of revenue as the reason. Honesty and religious aid organizations can sometimes have trouble finding each other. For the record, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says, The United States is the worlds top resettlement country. Weve done our part. Maybe somebody else can have a turn playing Russian roulette with their future.

0,"Catching HIV Virus Has Gotten Easier Nowadays Getting an HIV infection is easier than it used to be, thanks to the internet. Craigslist personal ads in any market increases HIV infection rates by 15.9 percent, according to research by Jason Chan, assistant professor of information and decision services at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. The personals are invitations for relationships ranging from platonic to one-night stands.The researchers narroweddown the increase to the influence of the Craigslist personals, not the sites escort service ads. Their findings were consistent with other research that indicates that internet-facilitated sex workers arent as likely to engage in risky behaviors with clients. The research shows that the rise in HIV rates is consistent in 33 states over an eight-year period. The study was published in the Jan. 30, 2015, issue of MIS Quarterly. I actually think that the creators of Craigslist had no intent of harming society. They came in with good intentions, says Chan in the quarterly. At the same time, they did not anticipate that users could use the features in an unexpected way with unintended consequences. Chan and Professor Anindya Ghose of NYUs Stern School of Business based their claims after analyzing data in 33 states from 1999 to 2008. Because Craigslist randomly enters individual markets with respect to HIV trends, it provided a unique natural experiment setup from which the researchers could uncover the connection. When mapped nationally, more than 6,000 HIV cases annually and treatment costs estimated between $62 million and $65.3 million can be linked to the website, according the researchers. Our study results suggest that there is a new social route of HIV transmission that is taking place in this digital era, says Chan in the journal. Health care practitioners and policymakers have to look more closely at online platforms to assess how its usage may facilitate the spread of HIV and STDs across the country. According to Chan, the paper provides practitioners with insights on how they can effectively target their efforts to reduce disease transmission facilitated through classified ad sites. The Center for Disease Control has taken note of the findings and posted an early version of the paper its website. The paper is titled Internets Dirty Secret: Assessing the Impact of Online Intermediaries on HIV Transmission, Chan, J. and Ghose, A.,MIS Quarterly (December 2014) "

0,"BREAKING! GOP Gives VA Execs Legal Consequences As Lawmakers Stand Up For Our Vets! Lawmakers in the House approved a Bill that will make it much easier to fire VA employees who are negligent or do poor performance work along with any misconduct. This Bill is long over due since the VA scandal began two years ago. Veterans were dying before they could get treatment and many had to wait 6 months or more to be seen. The medical record keeping was fudged by workers illegally. They got caught but Obama did not serve them any consequences for their malpractice and neglect of our brave veterans awaiting care. Absolutely nothing was done but more talk about what they plan to do to make it easier and sooner for veterans to see a doctor. This effort was flawed and word got out that the vets are still waiting for long periods to be seen by a doctor. GOP lawmakers have urged the VA to fire more workers to improve the scandal-plagued agency. The Republican-sponsored bill was approved this week, 310-116. Sixty-nine Democrats and 241 Republicans voted for the bill. This Bill would shorten the time employees are given to respond to proposed discipline or firing and would eliminate a provision that allows senior executives to appeal disciplinary actions to an independent review board. Jeff Miller, the House VA Committee Chairman stated, pervasive lack of accountability among employees at all levels is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of VA reform. Miller, R-Fla., said reform efforts are doomed to fail until the problem of employee accountability is fixed. For too long, union bosses, administration officials and their enablers have used every trick in the book to help VA bureaucrats who cant or wont do their jobs remain firmly entrenched in the agencys bureaucracy, he said. The accountability bill he sponsored gets rid of loopholes that have protected deadwood employees for years, Miller said. Union bosses and defenders of the broken status quo will oppose this bill, and that is exactly why it must become law. The Senate bill would grant the VA secretary greater authority to discipline senior executives, while requiring appeals to be decided within 90 days. According to an article in Fox News,the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents 230,000 VA employees arent happy with the bill. They said the bill would undermine veterans health care and other services by gutting employees due process rights to challenge wrongful firing or retaliation against whistle blowers. David Cox Sr., the union president saidIf Congress passes this bill, front line employees who dare to speak up against mismanagement and patient harm will face retaliation, harassment and the loss of their jobs, He called this Billa partisan effort to allow favoritism and cronyism by turning VA workers into at-will employees who can be fired at any time with little to no recourse. The Obama administration opposes the bill, saying it could undermine VAs workforce and ultimately hinder services to veterans. H/T: Fox News "

China Changes One Child Policy In an amazing change on one of the great demographic disasters of human history, China, another of the various old world countries cobbled together by appropriating provinces and countries that were previously on their own, at least for a little while, is abandoning its one child policy. Families may now have two children. China on Thursday said it would formally end its notorious one-child policy, which was intended to curb a surging population but has since been blamed for looming demographic problems in the worlds No. 2 economy. In a brief statement on Thursday, Chinas official Xinhua News Agency said all Chinese would be allowed to have two children. It didnt provide a time frame or any other details. China effectively hobbled the one-child policy two years ago, when it allowed couples to have two children if one parent came from a household without other siblings. It has also long allowed exceptions in some parts of the country. Chinas one child policy was instituted in 1980. In the intervening 35 years, China has seen a number of potentially detrimental social and economic issues crop up: These were consequences anyone with sense of how human nature works could have foretold.

0,"Benghazi Docs Tell Of Illegal Activity In Libya By Hillary State Department This is going to shock absolutely no one, particularly those who heard the rumors early on of just what the heck American Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was doing in the desert the night of September 11, 2012 in Benghazi, but it looks like Hillary Clinton may have pulled an Oliver North. The Washington Times has obtained documents complete in folders from the Benghazi compound that outline a gun running operation to the people looking to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi. The State Department initially approved a weapons shipment from a California company to Libyans seeking to oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 even though a United Nations arms ban was in place, according to memos recovered from the burned-out compound in Benghazi. The documents, obtained by The Washington Times, show U.S. diplomats at the Benghazi compound were keeping track of several potential U.S.-sanctioned shipments to allies, one or more of which were destined for the Transitional National Council, the Libyan movement that was seeking to oust Gadhafi and form a new government. The shipment itself was to come from a California firm called Dolarian Capital, an American arms merchant. It was to include: rocket launchers, grenade launchers, 7,000 machine guns and 8 million rounds of ammunition, much of it new and inexpensive hardware originally produced in the former Soviet bloc of Eastern Europe, according to an itemized list included in the end use certificate. Anybody other than a Clinton and a member of the Obama Administration at that pulls this and theyd be in the Supermax in Florence, Colorado by now. The ban on such arms shipments, yes, comes from the United Nations, but the United States did comply with it. As it happens, the arms were never actually shipped. The State Department revoked the end user agreement, after it was initially approved. BUT, there was a deal in the works and the consulate in Benghazi had all the paperwork. This just happens to all coincide with the time period surrounding the missing Hillary Clinton emails, and its smelling a whole lot like one great big plain and simple cover-up. Wonder if Trey Gowdy is going to touch on it tomorrow. Stay tuned. H/T Conservative Treehouse "
0,"Former Inmate Files Charges of Rape Against Correctional Officers An Indiana sheriff and two correctional officers are being sued by a former inmate who is claiming one of the officers raped her multiple times. Miranda Roberts, 23, was being held at the county jail on drug dealing charges earlier this year. According to court documents, Roberts is accusing officer Jared Bultemeyer of raping her multiple times in January and February. She is suing an unnamed female officer as well for knowing about the assaults and doing nothing to stop them, as well as Sheriff Rekeweg for failing to adequately train and supervise his officers. The lawsuit has been filed in federal court and criminal investigation is pending. Officer Bultemeyer has been removed from duty pending the investigation. Roberts is currently serving a three year prison sentence on drug dealing charges. Well it is possible she is telling the truth, but being a druggies she probably is only looking for a big payday. "

In Portland, Oregon a radical group of Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets again in their usual pathetic manner. This time they did more than bash the police force, they disgraced our American flag and humiliated Patriots who were there. Over the weekend, the cop-haters marched in Portlandfrom the Portland State University to the Multnomah County Courthouse while chanting write in Raiford and Black Lives Matter. In a Blue Lives Matter article, they write that Teressa Raiford is the leader of the Dont Shoot Portlandgroup who is trying to become the Multnomah County Sheriff. Some members of the group also chanted these racist cops have got to go. Follow Mike Benner @MikeBennerKGW Some local news agencies report that the Bundy supporter is planning to file and bring charges with police against the person who took their flag. Town folk said that Teressa Raiford wants to be sheriff, but her supporters steal other peoples property, block public roads, and burn American flags. That doesnt seem like a very fitting person to be in charge of a Sheriffs Department. "
0,"Lou Dobbs - Ryan Must Decide - Go With Trump Or Go Home Lou Dobbs has a few thoughts on the Increasingly isolated and clearly politically perplexed Speaker Paul Ryan. Dobbs describes as peculiar Ryans calls for Republican unity as he simultaneously insists Donald Trumps rise as the Republican Partys presumptive presidential nominee has been so fast, so shocking that he has been left breathless and unsteady and uncertain as to whether he should be part of the very unity that he himself is calling for. Dobbs asks if were confused. He replies that Most people are, about Mr. Ryan. Today Ryan topped himself, says Dobbs, One day before Ryan and Trump are set to meet the speaker said Republicans cant pretend the party is unified. No one has suggested even in the slightest otherwise. So Ryan continues to say little about mostly nothing. But whatever plagues the wretched woebegone Wisconsinite, his colleagues in the House are lining up with Trump. Dobbs quotes a senior Republican Senate source as saying Ryans hesitation is costing the GOP valuable fundraising time in preparation for the upcoming battle against the Democrats. Lou Dobbs is on target, saying, In my opinion Ryan has become a caricature of himself who has won more favor with Democrats by collaborating with the White House than anything hes done for the Republican Congress. Ryan is in fact, Dobbs notes, that voters this year are rebelling against. In Congress for 17 years, Ryan has produced exactly three bills that have become law, including one to name a post office after a professional politician and another to place an excise tax on arrows. Dobbs points out that in addition to his lack of productivity in the House, Ryan is a slacker on the campaign trail, having lost his home state of Wisconsin when he was the Vice Presidential nominee in 2012 and lost his hometown of Janesville twice during that same year. Dobbs describes Ryan as More than vaguely, it seems to me, delusional, about his own capacity and the political reality that now confronts him. I believe personally its time for Ryan to find some, some little scintilla of modesty and some considerable, considerable amount of gratitude for what has been fortunes favor and to be grateful for the political opportunity that a magnanimous Donald Trump will be presenting him tomorrow on Capitol Hill. Well, were left with follow or get out of the way, Mr. Speaker. Its that time; Trump is the partys future, and I think, the countrys.

0,"[Watch] Tsunami of Illegals - A Government Sanctioned Invasion of America, Inside Information Fox News reporter Todd Starnes has excellent sources within different areas of the border crisis. He adds more evidence to the heaping piles that show this is a Democrat effort to flood the nation with their most favored demographic, and to transform us to a third-world socialist nation in the process. Starnes says he has multiple sources, both inside the camps as well as and inside BCFS, the security firm hired by the government to run them. He verifies earlier reports that employees, particularly health care workers, are under gag-orders to not speak of the conditions or the health of the children under a threat of the loss of their jobs and possible criminal prosecution. He also points out that a source within BCFS, the security firm running the camps, has told him that the orders for secrecy come from the federal government. They are more than willing to allow access if it were not for the restrictions put in place by the feds. Starnes reveals that some of the healthcare workers he has spoken to tell him that many of these kids want to go right back home, that they dont know why they were sent here to this country, and they want to go back to their moms and dads. He says this isnt reunification, this is a government sanctioned invasion of our country. He also questions who these kids are being sent home to here in the United States, when he hears from his sources that mom and dad are still back across the border in Central America. He then drops the money bomb, saying that he knows of many of the workers at the Lackland facility who are making $5,000 per week, and we tax payers are the ones footing the bill.

0,"The Greatest President Ever? ISIS Sure Thinks So... I have tried to find anything good thats come from this administration over the last few years. I cant think of one thing that makes us stronger. The military has been cut, which makes our enemy stronger. Taliban extremist have been released which makes our enemy stronger. We continue to get weaker while ISIS grows stronger. The decisions being made are not made with incompetence. They are decisions that have been carefully thought out. Thought out by a group of individuals that hate us. Washington needs to wake up and figure out a way to remove Obama from office. This man is no friend of the United States and never will be. Obama tricked us all and if Washington doesnt do something he is going to destroy us. There isnt anyone bigger than this country or above our laws. That holds especially true to traitors even if they work in our Government. Anyone in Washington who chooses to ignore this treason is just as guilty as the traitors themselves. We are at war and political correctness is going to get people killed. I am not worried about hurting anyones feelings. My concern is for this country and future generations. Lawmakers need to do their jobs or the children of this world dont stand a chance. Semper Fi America and may God forever bless this Nation Shep #Marine4Truth The only moron I see here is you. You are obviously a muslim and like the idea of raping little boys and girls and beheading those who disagree with your fake religion. I hope when your time comes you are embalmed with pigs blood and shrouded ind a pigs hide and left to rot. Thanks Randy For The Compliment I Enjoy Being Called Names Even A Moron If Thats What It Takes To Get Another Moron To Think As they say it takes one to know one so God bless you sir its nice to know one Thanks,The guy Shep is a moron. What a crock of shit,this guy should be ashamed of himself to make up such stupid shit. LOL Factcheck- lefty check for liberalslmao Muslims have been gaining in numbers and territory by torturing and killing unbelievers since the 7th century until the Ottoman empire was broken up after WWI in 1924. They enslaved and raped captive women and children during their rein of terror. They tried to invade Europe many times but were pushed back by the Crusades. Unless we know history we are fooled into believing Terrorism is something new by Islam because of the terrible things the United States is doing or because Israel was made into a nation after WWII. The truth is terrorist are following the teachings of the Quran just like they did during the Ottoman empire. Moderate Muslims are just the ones that dont take Islam seriously. The radical Muslims are the ones who take it seriously because Islam is a radical belief. Islam seeks the establishment of Sharia law that calls for the submission and or death of unbelievers. Our constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Sharia law is, of its own nature, unconstitutional and can not be permitted in order to protect the very freedom of religion it seeks to destroy. The other problem with Islam is it isnt just a religion, it is also a form of government that seeks to replace other forms of governments. The country and the worlds time is running out. We must soon stand against the scum in Washington. If we are attacked, he has the power to stand down the military. That is why he is pushing allow foreigners into the military. His removal must begin in Congress come Wednesday morning no matter who wins. "
0,"[Video] John Kerry: Scripture Commands USA to Protect Muslim Countries Against Global Warming Apparently Lurch is at it again. Last Wednesday, at a ceremony to appoint Texas lawyerShaarik Zafar to be special representative to Muslim communities, Secretary of State John Kerry said it was the United States Biblical responsibility to confront climate change, including to protect vulnerable Muslim majority counties. Kerry said Scripture, in particular the Book of Genesis, makes clear it is our duty to protect the planet and we should look at Muslim countries with a sense ofstewardship of earth, adding, That responsibility comes from God. Can we get a shout out for Noah? And here you thought all along that Uncle Joe was the resident crazy in the Obama administration. I must say, it is always interesting to watch a liberal attempt to play theologian. Obama did it with homosexuality and now Kerry is playing it with climate change. They certainly have no problem using religion when its convenient to advance one of their crackpot agendas yet it is demonized at every other opportunity for things that really matter to the rest of us. ARVE Error: Element ID could not be build, please report this bug. The world is aflame and the absolutely last thing I am concerned about when it comes to the Muslim world is how climate change may or may not affect them. Honestly, its the very, very last thing on a very, very long list of concerns I do in fact have with all those who follow the teachings of Muhammad. This ongoing, seemingly compulsive need to pander to the Islamic world is worrying indeed. Especially since thousands of Christians in the Middle East are being slaughtered, raped, enslaved, and driven out of their homes by followers of the same religion. One can only ask why? so many times. It is theoretically comforting that Kerry appears to have had a come to Jesus moment when it comes to Christianity. But we all know that in reality its just a farce and another ploy to try to placate the Muslims and convince them that as People of the Book we really arent all that bad and to please try to stop blowing us up and beheading our people. It reminds me of the utterly bizarre directive of Obama to turn NASA into some sort of Muslim outreach program. Absurdity continues to run amok during the reign of President Barack Obama. Do the members of the Obama administration even live in the same world as the rest of us? Where specifically in the Old and New Testaments does the words Muslim, or climate change appear? To be very specific, nowhere. It seems like there is not a day that goes by that a prominent liberal doesnt say something that isnt simply stupid. Quoting Scripture to protect Muslim lands is a new one to me. Perhaps he doesnt read the same Bible as you or I. And since when is religion matters a mantra for the State Department? What the heck is that even supposed to mean anyway? One would think that if that was really true, the nutjob, militant atheistic Left would be up in arms but they are not. They know that such a statement is merely a hollow, meaningless piece of propaganda and totally without merit. I am inclined to concur with their conclusion. It sounds like this is just as an apparent cover and excuse to impose massive government intrusion into every aspect of the daily life of the average American. Because thats where it leads and is what it means. The morals, values, and concepts of Christianity have been under unrelenting attack by this administration since its inception and its interesting that suddenly these types of references to scripture appear right before the mid-term elections. Perhaps a half-hearted attempt by some to confuse the average evangelical voter? Who knows? Kerry, the Bible also says we are commanded to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I [Jesus] have commanded you. Care to publicize that the State Department is making that its mantra to the Muslim nations? I didnt think so. As the son, grandson, and great-grandson of ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ I can assure you that the theology of both John Kerry and Barack Obama is far from the truth and only being used as a cynical ploy to advance their ideological, and not theological, agendas. Its always a bit distressing to hear Godless people try to misuse scripture to forward their secular agendas. I wonder if Kerry is aware of the scriptures describing liars and their one way ticket to hell. Id love to hear him discuss that one sometime. Scripture also condemns bearing false witness which he has been caught doing innumerable times. One can only surmise that Kerry is selective when it comes to his faith worldview. Just being a Christian when its convenient isnt acceptable. When it comes to the liberal mind we are supposed to ignore Biblical passages about God knowing us while we are still in the womb and anything about the condemnation of homosexuality, but get all Biblical on climate change. For them, global warming is in many ways a new religion that trumps all others. I have a news flash, neither Kerry or Gore is the new Moses leading us into the Promised Land. And last, but not least, if the Obama administration could come up with a strategy protecting both Muslims and others from beheadings, torture, forced starvation, rape, imprisonment, and mass executions at the hands of other, more devout, Muslims it would be appreciated. In the end, the real God of Progressives and liberals is the almighty state, not the God of the Bible. Big government is not God, and Barack is not his prophet. Im wondering who was appointed as the Special Representative to Christian Communities? Or Hindu Communities. Or even Atheist communities for that matter. Is it because those groups dont cut peoples heads off? Or is it because our President grew up muslim? At the time Jesus was crucified, there were no Catholics in the world. sorry, that is the U.S.A . does becoming a Democrat automatically make you brain dead ? this guy has been in the magic mushroom patch again .. Where in the hell does he get his interpertation ? and why should we protect Muslim countries when all they want is to destroy the U.S.S. and behead Americans . Screw you, you idiot !!! Another idiot libtard stands up on his hind-legs and speaks total bull-crap. Show me where the scriptures say the Muslims have to be protected from globule warming. Hey, History Check Please, Mohammed the Prophet was 600 A.D. , this means after Jesus dying on the cross by 600 years earlier !!!!!!!! well I do not know what bible you are looking in but it is not in the king James bible but it may be in the catholic book ,do you know where the catholic doctrine came from the priest that had Jesus killed and some of the roman guards started it and to this day they put Mary above Jesus, who can trust any one who is catholic . There is nothing in the bible about global warming there is words about God ordering all muslims yes I said ALL muslims killed there animals killed and the ground scorched and his orders were not carried out and look what a pig sty we are in now. Time to complete gods work More blather from the forehead. As much as it bothers me to agree with John Kerry, in this case, I do have to say I think a good nuclear winter would clear their global warming right up. "
0,"[Watch] GOP Establishment Buying Black Votes in MS, Former Governor Implicated Fox Host Ainsley Earhardt reports on the long list of election irregularities cited in a lawsuit just filed against the Senatorial campaign of Thad Cochran by his Tea Party challenger, Chris McDaniel. The complaint includesillegal voting, as well as a wide range of false allegations against McDaniel which included being associated with the KKK, and the risk that he would take from voters federal food stamps, student loans and public schools. Theres also the little problem of a very credible black pastor named Steve Fielder who has come forward and provided evidence of vote buying. The reported price was fifteen dollars per vote, not a small sum in Mississippi, one of the poorer states in the union. True the Vote is now looking into reported double voting by people who had voted in the Democrat primary three weeks earlier, which is illegal in Mississippi and which appears to have played a major role in the presumed Cochran victory. Earhardt also brings out some of the anti-McDaniel ads which were funded by former Governor Haley Barbour, which are targeted at black voters, urging them to vote against the Tea Party attempts to take away their social programs. McDaniel issued a statement which indicated they have uncovered widespread fraud and that a legal challenge to the results will not only be forthcoming, but will likely prove wrongdoing, possibly criminal.

0,"Abby Johnson And Debunking The Planned Parenthood Tangled Spin Machine Just like everyone else who leans right, this writer has some well-meaning leftist friends who are pretty dependable when it comes to posting information meant to dispell any anxiety in liberal la la land caused by the extreme right-wing (whatever that is). In the last week, two of them have been busy posting apologetics for Planned Parenthood and unspinning the spin that seems to be making them dizzy. On the same day that the second video was released from the Center for Medical Progress showing a Planned Parenthood official haggling with potential brokers for baby body parts all for the cost of storage and transportation even if the facility doesnt actually do that FactCheck.org, a website run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, published a piece that obviously took some time to produce, but was just a day late to actually be credible beyond wishful thinking. the full, unedited video they cite as evidence shows a Planned Parenthood executive repeatedly saying its clinics want to cover their costs, not make money, when donating fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research. Four expertsin the field of human tissue procurement told usthe price range discussed in the video $30 to $100 per patient represents a reasonable fee. Theres no way theres a profit at that price, said Sherilyn J. Sawyer, the director of Harvard University and Brigham and Womens Hospitals biorepository. Heres the problem with that: why haggle over price and it being mutually satisfying, as the second video demonstrates, if theres no profit in it? Wouldnt the Planned Parenthood people have worked out a set price if the cash was utilitarian? At one point in the [first]unedited video (which was also released by the group), Nucatola says: Affiliates are not looking to make money by doing this. Theyre looking to serve their patientsand just make it not impact their bottom line. Nucatola also says, No ones going to see this as a money making thing. And at another point, she says, Our goal, like I said, is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream, because thats not what it is. By definition, money coming in is a revenue stream, and serving patients without impacting the bottom linewithout this revenue, would Planned Parenthood seriously not be able to serve their patients? The federations profits are over a million dollars for the entire country annually (and the $500 million in cash from the government isnt listed on their Charity Navigator pageinFY2013, because that money goes to the affiliates as health services grants and reimbursements, not the parent organization according to p. 23 of the most recent annual report for FY 2014. Sneaky). That is the defense that FactCheck.org grabbedbefore they knew the second video was coming. At the same time, many Americans are wondering just how brazen can people be to flaunt Federal Law that carries with it penalties of $500,000 and ten years in jail if caught. Well, according to Planned Parenhood refugee, Abby Johnson, theres a loophole. She explained it to the Washington Times. The law currently states that there can be moneys exchanged as long as they fit under certain categories like preservation, collection, storage, transport, etc., Ms. Johnson said. And the law says there is not a maximum amount that can be charged or a minimum amount but that costs cannot be prohibitive. And thats very subjective. So, just like is done in the grant writing community where overhead is subjective, Planned Parenthood could set a price higher than is really necessary for preservation, collection, storage, transport, etc. Except that the physicians were talking about specific organs. At any rate, Ms. Johnson also explained that this sort of collection of tissue and transfer to research facilities is not out of the ordinary. At my affiliate, we did abortions at the time up until 16 weeks. You can begin harvesting fetal tissue at approximately eight weeks, Ms. Johnson said. Organs are present earlier, but you cant really decipher them until about 12 weeks. Thats not all of the organs, but some of the larger ones, you can pick those out and say, OK, this is a liver. And thats usually around 12 weeks. Johnson claims that once the day was finished, the staff would pack up what was salvagible, put in some dry ice and ship them off. In other words it happens all the time. Why? Because women sign the consent form for it to happen. They are convinced donating the baby to research will do somebody good someday. From an ethical standpoint, doing this with miscarried babies as that is Gods will is a completely different matter. This writer knows many people whose angels were donated to science. However that does not change that not many companies do this sort of work. Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Centers Department of Population Health, also raised the issue of high transfer costs, telling Reuters that only a few companies collect the fetal tissue and that they charge a lot for it. Im not sure people who donate it realize that, Mr. Caplan added. And that is the loophole activists like Abby Johnson say is exposed right along with Planned Parenthood with these videos. They [clinics] could say, Well, its more difficult for me to harvest a brain than it is for me to harvest a kidney, so that collection fee is going to be $1,000 for a brain, whereas its only going to be $400 for a kidney, Ms. Johnson said. And the problem is that its so subjective, the amount of money that can be charged. Thats really where we need reform. The Planned Parenthood spin machine has been working overtime to rescue the organization from the work of the Center for Medical Progress. The problem, though, is that even the uncut videos with protestations of we arent making any money are belied by the facts. Planned Parenthood can still charge what ever they want for the organs even if the excuse is to better serve their patients and make their financials come out even. "

The incident happened around 1 a.m. near the intersection of Gravois Avenue and Itaska Street. According to the police, the victims name is Zemir Begic. Reports say he suffered injuries to his head, abdomen, face and mouth. What happens today is the repercussions of what happened yesterday. People can only pull a card from the hand they were dealt. You Sir sound like you want to bring back lynch mobs which is an ignorant form of justice that is one of the root causes of racial problems today. If you consider the good old days to be before the Europeans arrival to other continents I will agree with you 100%. Why doesnt the title include the race of the attackers? Is that only when it is a white police officer and a black teen?(I am using my most sarcastic voice when I say teen). stupid fucks, they need to be euthanized so the world can be free of their bullshit, period. Just a comment here. Years ago, when I was in the Navy, I worked with men of most ethnic backgrounds. We usually all got along, did our work all day, and went to Happy Hour together, right after work. Usually we sat around, drinking beer, until time to eat, then we would go our separate ways. A black man, who worked with you, would join you for Happy Hour, but as soon as other black men entered the club, your black friend, would leave your group, and go join the other black men. In effect, segregating themselves. I always thought it was rather strange behavior. These bums deserve the death penalty. Its pretty disgusting that the last sentence reads details of the attack being racially motivated are still unknown. Since when do we ask that question 1st? Shouldnt we assume it was racially motivated? Attention yall white folk why arent you rioting in the streets? Why arent you looting stores? And wth is taking so long for you to set fire to Nordstroms? What should our slogan if they have hands up dont shoot do we hold a 24 up and nails. Im not trying to be funny but Im sick of the double standard. This atrocious crime isnt even in the news. I guess its because its a black on white crime instead of the opposite. Damn shame.

Damn shame. rick hatfield, you hit the nail on the head! thats exactly what the so called blac leaders want. a bunch of minions to do the killing while they set back and collect the blood money. the sad part about that is the minions are to stupid know this! where is obuma and holder to say this is a racist attack on a white person and should not be allowed. where is the media , they all s u c k . Blacks doing their race proud! Whew, that was a close one if the victim had been black and the suspects been white, it would have been racist :/ Its terrible that this young man died. Its terrible that his cowardly attackers havent been brought to justice yet. But do you honestly believe that statement? And if it was somehow true, what difference would it make? A killing is a killing. As for your little joke about hammer control, you cant stand off about 300 yards and take 22 pot shots into a crowd with little to no training and still kill multiple people with a hammer. So if a white cop shoots a black thug its automatically racially motivated but if a GROUP of black teens beats a white man to death its only a question whether it was racially motivated??? DISGUSTING!!!!!!! I am sure Al not so Sharpton and Jesse Jackhammer will say the white man deserved it because he was driving a car and those boys werent old enough to drive a car so it was his white privilege. SICKENING!!!! It was hammers. Hammers caused this. What a BS website this is. Did you not see the photo at the top of the story? Somebody get a clue, the attack WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED, AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE BELONGS IN THE LOONEYBIN! It is sad that today, the perpetrators are protected from the kind of justice they would have gotten 80 years ago (WIND CHIME). Only through public corporal punishment (CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, if a violent crime results in death) will order be restored to the punks in our cities, TIME TO BRING BACK THE GOOD OLD DAYS So was the victim white? It didnt say other than not sure if racially motivated. You seriously question whether this beating was racially motivated? Its always okay for blacks to do whatever they want to whoever they want. Hell yes this is racial, and nothing with come of it, as usual. Why do people keep asking this question? Where do you think they are? Waiting for another White/Hispanic on Black crime. Rabid animals that need to be put down. If you are tired of whites getting killed by blacks and other races and black thugs being haled as martyrs and what to do something to keep our neighborhoods safe send me a friends request at dustyamberharless on fb. like and share. It is a damn shame that the most dangerous thing in America is a young black man. These animals make life difficult for the many honest hard working young black kids that are working hard and playing by the rules. Where in hell is black leadership?

0,"Americans And The Global Warming Public Relations Failure Because we have to survey EVERYTHING that might remotely smack of politics in the United States and make news with the news real or imagined, the Associated Press andNORC Center for Public Affairs Research (from the University of Chicago) did a rather in depth survey of just over a thousand Americans and asked their opinions on global warming after Pope Francis visit when he exhorted Americans to pay attention to Mother Earth. Answers to the questions on the pope himself have been withheld at this time for later publication, but an early release of the global warming questions and how the people answered regarding global warming and their opinions and attitudes toward the concept is available. Check out this graphic: Really, thats 39% of Americans are not too worried or not at all worried about global warming. (Only 16% of those surveyed actually DONT BELIEVE that global warming is happening, so the underground skeptics and deniers network has some work to do in breaking through the smokescreen of information the proponents have thrown up.) What is interesting about this entire exercise and the popes speeches on the topic is that there is a series of questions in the survey that more or less gives away the game: As the years have gone on with the global warming crowd making one chicken little type prediction after another trying to shame the people into giving up prosperous lifestyles and unlimited energy consumption in the name of saving the planet, the propaganda was meant to make a moral issue out of stopping man-made climate change. Not that there is anything wrong with caring for the environment, and being good stewards of the earth, but the global warming people want to bankrupt us in order to stop anthropologic climate change that does not appear to actually be happening. And like everything else thats been used to get Americans to give up their freedoms, the environmentalists tried to use fear to get the people to go along with the idea right next to morality. So far, it appears that while the message of man actually changing the environment might be penetrating, the alarm that was supposed to be generated next to it has not materialized. With the big Climate Change Conference coming up in Paris later this month, look for a lot more THE SKY IS FALLING stories to come from the mainstream media. The previous waves of global warming propaganda did not work as intended. They will undoubtedly try another angle. Quick aside: there is a scandal brewing at the Vatican as the people advising the pope have excluded climate skeptics from the group of scientists making climate recommendation. As a Catholic, this writer will tell the reader that this is contrary to the normal way of doing things. All sides are supposed to be considered and His Holiness is depending on the wrong people to advise him. H/T Watts Up With That "
0,"Proof Its No Accident, No Surprise - Conducted Last Year - Fed Govt-Funded University Studies on Border Crisis, UACs The University of Texas, El Paso created a report recently that relates directly to the influx of illegals on the Mexican border. It was conducted in 2013 and completed prior to the current increased illegal activity, and may have been commissioned as a barometer for just how effective the schemes of DHS and the Obama regime might be expected to be. The report starts by referencing the increased illegal immigration of the last three years, and the associated increase in Other Than Mexican (OTM) unaccompanied alien children (UAC). The report cites a need on behalf of the enforcement agencies of the DHS to meet the requirements of the Flores v. Reno Settlement Agreement, which stipulates the placement criteria for UAC. The HHS Office for Refugee and Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for long-term placement in contracted shelters while awaiting immigration hearings. That is not a small point that should be overlooked. The UAC are already being placed into the custody of a body that prejudges them to be refugees in need of resettlement. The report quotes statistics which show a 367.6 percent increase since fiscal year 2011 in the number of UACs in the Rio Grande Valley/Harlingen Field Office. In the fall of 2013, the research team from UTEP conducted several fact-finding trips to multiple Border Patrol and ICE facilities to gather information for their report. They conducted interviews with the agents who are involved in dealing with the UACs on a daily basis. UTEP researchers found that both the Border Patrol and ICE officers with whom they spoke pointed to an awareness of a lack of consequences on the part of the illegal aliens as a chief contributing factor to the problem. The government respondents told the researchers that the smugglers and human cargo are aware that once the illegals are apprehended, they will be re-united with a U.S. based family pending an immigration hearing. They recognize that the process is being exploited by those wishing to use the resources of the United States to violate immigration laws. Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officials told the researchers of their belief that the numbers of illegal UACs will continue to increase until enforcement of the law is once again resumed. They anticipate, absent enforcement, the best-case scenario to be a leveling out of UAC numbers. The agents identified the primary factor in the placement of UACs is the availability of a shelter. A shelter that is overfilled can lose its license, so they are very careful not to exceed approved levels. Of course, no such requirements exist for military bases and other locations which are being used for the staging and warehousing of the invaders at present. Still, once an individual has physically left a shelter, their space can be used to import another illegal, so the push from DHS and the lawless Obama regime is strong to move people through the system quickly. The UTEP report also indicates that roughly thirty percent of UACs are identified as having special needs such as pregnancy, mental illness, physical handicaps and those under age two. Special needs individuals are placed at the front of the line. That policy is a bit hard to understand. Illegals who will assuredly be a burden on the taxpayer, those incubating anchor babies, mentally ill, or physically handicapped, as well as WIC candidates are given a priority into the country. Upon just what basis was it determined that mental illness and other potentially negative characteristics are a criterion for fast track acceptance into American society? Only a limited amount of special needs-compliant shelters are available in the 12 which serve the Rio Grande Valley (RGV). The result of that limited space and the shortage created through special needs designations is greater pressure to move illegal invaders into the interior of the country and into the shadows of private facilities. This research was done prior to the current explosion at the border, when things were still largely going on behind a curtain of DHS secrecy, guided by Obamas secretary of open borders, DHS chief, Jeh Johnson. There is more to the story; you can read the report for yourself at thislink, or wait for my follow-up tomorrow.

0,"Congressman Takes Major Step Towards Obama Impeachment, Regime Trials An effort is underway by the United States Patriots Union, through Congress, in the form of a resolution being offered by Rep Ted Yoho (R-FL) to finally begin the process of investigating and holding the criminal Obama regime accountable for their treason against the United States. The resolution, to be introduced this week, calls for the creation of a Special Select Committee, in cooperation with a Special Task Force established by the FBI for the purpose of investigating alleged high crimes and misdemeanors. The Select Committee would issue its results in a report to the House Judiciary Committee in matters specified as: (1) all policies, decisions, and activities that may meet the standard of high crime or misdemeanor, especially related to aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States, weakening United States sovereignty and security; (2) all policies, decisions, and activities within the Obama Administration related to border security and illegal immigration, as well as current Administration policies related to Middle Eastern refugee resettlement activities as they pertain to national security; (3) internal and public executive branch communications about economic policy, foreign policy, Military readiness and Rules of Engagement, illegal immigration, Middle Eastern refugee resettlement, the attacks on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, events surrounding the downing of Extortion 17, August 6, 2011, Fast and Furious gun running on the southern border, and other alleged arms dealing in the Middle East that may have aided and armed ISIL (ISIS) or other known terror organizations, involving the Department of State and the Department of Justice; (4) accountability for policies and decisions related to the security and force protection for all Military, Intelligence, Contract and Diplomatic members on foreign deployment in the interest of the United States, in particular throughout the Middle East since January 20, 2009, including individuals and entities responsible for those policies and decisions; (5) executive branch authorities efforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the downing of Extortion 17 in the Wardak Province, Tangi River Valley, Afghanistan, August 6, 2011, and the Raven 23 incident, Nisour Square, Iraq, September 16, 2007; (6) executive branch activities and efforts to obstruct Congressional inquiries into the attacks on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012 and the downing of Extortion 17, August 6, 2011, as well as illegal Executive Orders misusing Federal Agencies to target constitutionally protected rights of specific classes of Americans on the basis of race, religion or political affiliations; (7) executive branch activities and policies regarding compliance with standing court orders to cease and desist aiding and abetting illegal immigration, and the persons responsible for those decisions and policies, and illegal Executive Orders forcing Immigration Officers to violate the 1986 Immigration Reform Act and all standing immigration and naturalization laws; (8) information related to lessons learned from the attacks and executive branch activities and efforts to protect United States facilities and personnel abroad; and recommendations to the House Judiciary Committee on the best path for holding individuals fully accountable for any and all acts which threatened or weakened national sovereignty and security, directly or indirectly, and whether or not those activities are believed to involve malice or ill intent; and (9) any other relevant issues relating to national sovereignty and security, and any measures taken to remedy any policy decisions which may demonstrate malice or ill intent on the part of any Obama Administration official, including by the President or Vice President. Theres enough included in the resolution to keep the entire Justice Department occupied for years, due to the volume of criminality and associated activities which must be investigated. The US government has become the largest organized crime organization in the world under this and previous administrations although there is no doubt that the levels of anti-American activity have increase exponentially under this current criminal regime, most significantly in the DHS under the boundless treachery and corruption of Secretary Jeh Johnson. While some might argue that its a little late in the game to be taking this action now, and there is no denying that Congress should have acted years ago, our situation could become much worse as the final days of the regime draw near, and they slip even more into a reckless abandon mode. At a minimum, the knowledge that an investigation and possible criminal consequences exists may serve to rein in the dictator and his minions to a degree. Organizers of the effort include the United States Patriots Union. The original press release, along with the names of Congressmen to contact in support, can be viewed here.

0,"[Watch] She Cant Handle The Truth - Pelosi Interrupts, Chases Down House Rep Who Struck a Nerve Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania Tom Marino puts Nancy Pelosi and her lying ilk in their place from the floor of the House of Representatives. If theres one thing that will get a response out of the haggard former Speaker, its a member of the opposition exposing the lies she has worked so diligently to fabricate from into legislative tools. Marino says clearly that if the Democrats wanted to do something about the border situation other than make political hay out of it, they should have acted when they had control of the House as well as the Senate and Executive Branch. He asserts that they waited until they could use it for political benefit, which is the point we are at now. He also points out that we dont have law and order now, we have gangs and drugs coming across the southern border and the Democrats dont want to do anything about it. He said we need to pass the legislation, make sure that the children get back to their families and we need to line up and protect this border from people coming across. Thats all Pelosi could take. She got up out of her chair and challenged Marino during his comments. He tutored her a little on the situation, informed her that what he was saying was in fact the truth and suggested that she needed to do the same type of research that he had done. The final icing on the cake was when he closed his arguments, referencing her misbehavior as indicative of the fact that he had struck the right nerve on the lawless open border invasion. She cant contain herself and attempts to again chase him down but Marino seems to have already left. She wanted to give him a piece of her mind but maybe shes better off. That is a commodity that seems to be in an already limited supply.

0,"Obama Hates America and White Americans Hussein Obama walked a tightrope in Dallas, balancing the need to appear to be respectful of the brutal murder of a group that he often vilifies with his inherent opportunism and impulse to knock the huge racism chip off of his own shoulder. To say that his comments were inappropriate, given the nature of the event they were protecting at the time of the ambush and the motivations of their murderer is a gross understatement. Obama views all American commoners as dispensable props, with police officers being perhaps the lowest of the low in his eyes. There was never a question as to whether or not their deaths were going to be exploited. The only question was in what way and how much he could get away with. Obama said that race relations have improved immensely in his lifetime, as if a guy that grew up in Hawaii, where there was little racism at the time and Indonesia, as an Islamic Indonesian citizen would know the difference. Once he returned to America, his Saudi sponsors fed him with a golden spoon. He goes into a folksy kind of come on America, you know youre racists, admit it kind of narrative, totally unbefitting the event and the sacrifice of the officers he was supposed to be honoring. He went on to label the Dallas Police Department and all others as racist, saying, No institution is entirely immune, and that includes our police departments. We know this. It also undoubtedly includes our dingy White House. We know that. We also know Obamas presence at their memorial service tarnished the memories of those who died in service to their community and fellow man. Obama is not worthy to stand on the same street as those brave and honorable men. Burgess Owens and Sheriff Clarke offer their views into the events as well as the hypocrisy that seeps out of every pore of the person who pretends to be president of the United States. "
0,"LA Court Slaps Planned Parenthood Video Makers...For Now Looks like the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has been releasing videos of high-ranking Planned Parenthood officials haggling over the price of fetal organs, touched a nerve. One of the peripheral companies in the investigation, StemExpress, a provider of fetal tissue obtained from Planned Parenthood to researchers featured in the third video, filed for and was granted a restraining order against the release of footage obtained during a May 2015 lunch with the undercover team. The Los Angeles Superior Court order issued Tuesday prohibits the Center for Medical Progress from releasing any video of three high-ranking StemExpress officials taken at a restaurant in May. It appears to be the first legal action prohibiting the release of a video from the organization. People with StemExpress, unboubtably, will claim that the video was obtained illegally, as the people at the meeting were not aware they were being video taped. However, the people at the CMP thought of that, as laws governing undercover surveillance vary from state to state and are quite strict. In a statement Wednesday, center leader David Daleiden said StemExpress was using meritless litigation to cover up an illegal baby parts trade. The Center for Medical Progress follows all applicable laws in the course of our investigative journalism work, he said. This restraining order or injunction does not preclude the release of any footage of personnel or officials from any other group or Planned Parenthood, just StemExpress. Despite the claim that StemExpresss rights have been vindicated in court all this does is delay the release of videos with footage of their people. It does not stop CMP from releasing additional offerings with yet more haggling and deal making over dead baby body parts. If nothing else, the Center for Medical Progress put abortion as a moral and societal abomination back in the American spotlight. That the proponents of trafficking dead babies scurried to the courts to stop them, rather than brazening out the bad publicity and embarrassment should tell the country more about them then they are willing to admit. By the way, yesterday, one presidential candidate asked a moral question about all the outrage this week. His tweet is worth considering. "
0,"NASA On 2014 Being The Warmest Year On Record: Were Pretty Sure, Yeah, Thats It Now that all The Sky Is Falling headlines have further cemented the idea that man-made global warming via excess carbon is actually happening, it seems that the computer model used by NASA to make that claim in the last week has a fairly large margin for error: In a press release on Friday, Nasas Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed 2014 was the warmest year on record. As a result [of the 3,000 measuring stations having a large margin of error], GISSs director Gavin Schmidt has now admitted Nasa thinks the likelihood that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880 is just 38 per cent. And then there was the little tidbit that this increase was two hundreths of a degree Celsius (thats 0.02, as in it was teeny tiny), which is several times smaller than the one tenth of a degree margin of error. The Daily Mail, the origin of the quotes above, wanted to be sure that the NASA data misrepresentation admission was yet not another smoke and mirrors incident, so they consulted a different study of similar data over the same time frame: Another analysis, from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project, drawn from ten times as many measuring stations as GISS, concluded that if 2014 was a record year, it was by an even tinier amount. Its report said: Numerically, our best estimate for the global temperature of 2014 puts it slightly above (by 0.01C) that of the next warmest year (2010) but by much less than the margin of uncertainty. Therefore it is impossible to conclude from our analysis which of 2014, 2010, or 2005 was actually the warmest year the Earths average temperature for the past decade has changed very little. Well, isnt that special. According to all the reports, greenhouse gas emissions have sky-rocketed and the earths temperature doesnt seem to be changing. Well, not by much anyway. At least one scientist, though, is willing to entertain the idea that non-human variables effect the earth at a global level: Since the earth is several billion years old science doesnt particularly have a consensus on that, either and it was a lot hotter not even a thousand years ago, and then a lot colder MANY times, it could well be non-human factors are more of a force than not. For now, however, there is an argument on just how many hundreths of a degree the earth warmed last year. That humans are to blame does not seem to be in doubt. If ya cant make it, fake it! "

0,"(WATCH) ANOTHER Banned Movie. Now Because It Violates Islam The $140 million Exodus: Gods and Kings starring Christian Bale is in hot water again. A few weeks ago, people were complaining that some of the cast were white. Now Muslim countries are banning the movie from being shown because it violates Islam by portraying a prophet. Though this isnt the first time Egypt has banned a Biblical movie. Earlier this year, it banned Noah and in 1998 The Prince of Egypt. Gaver Asfour, the culture minister of Egypt, stated that he felt the movie was offensive because it showed the Jews as being the builders of the pyramids, citing it as historical inaccuracy. Though the book of Exodus does say the enslaved Jews were forced to make bricks, it doesnt say they built the pyramids. (He is clearly not familiar with what happens when Hollywood puts their twist on movies). Asfour was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying the movie gives a Zionist view of history and contains historical inaccuracies and thats why we have decided to ban it. The culture minister also stated that there was no way a man could have parted the Red Sea and listed this as another historically inaccurate reason not to show the movie. Morocco, another mostly Muslim country, also banned the movie just before it was scheduled to be shown without any explanation. Included below is the trailer of the latest banned movie. Damn another movie I have to go see hate it when they do this banning crap. Oh please, Hollywood doesnt owe Muslims a thing! With as many biblical inaccuracies it has, I wish I had the couple of hours back I wasted watching it Islam, Mohamed, and Allah must truly be the weakest and poorest excuse for a divinity there has ever been. Its only means of recruitment, and conversion, are fear, terrorism, and murder. It is threatened by any thing that might challenge its thin veil of control it has over its followers,who are a backwards, inbred, pedophelic, beastialic, group who have not even figured out how to use soap. I think Muslims and Koreans should get over themselves its just a movie, no one complained about team america, plenty of Muslims and Kim jong un in that movie, clearly they dont know that its only for entertainment only, smh! Violates Islam? Who cares If anything this violates Christianity. This article has the nerve to call this movie a biblical movie? Wth?!! This shows how out of touch these people are with God and the message inspired by God in the Bible. This movie did anything but portray the actual story of the Bible therefore making it unbiblical. Hey Hollywood when you werent full of liberal retards and actually made good movies, the ten commandments by Cecile B. DeMilles was and still is a biblical movie. Youre welcome to express your opinion in a civilized fashion. So are we. Thats because we live in a civilized country. Im not a Christian, so to me the Bible is just another book. The way the book was written, God spoke to Moses and asked him to pass on a message. I read another book once wherein an alien kidnapped someone and asked them to pass on a message. Same thing, to me. Since youre not a Christian, you should try viewing this as just a book. If its a work of fiction, why does it matter? Would you get offended by, say, the Avengers movie, even though it has a Norwegian God in it? Of course not, because its just fiction. So, the movie is banned in another country? So what? If I want to see the movie, Im not going to travel to Egypt to do so. This isnt an attack on our 1st Amendment, it isnt censorship in the US, so who cares? I think, as Muslim you should stay out of what other people want to be entertained by. Not your business. Not your worry. Oh and by the waystop treating women like dog shit. Why not? Do you people think you have a right to run other peoples lives and govern what they can say and do? You cant even live together with out slaughtering each other. a Zionist view of history Ah, what would you expect from a book written by Jews? The entire idea is incredibly moronic. I think, as Muslim I liked the film how is produced, but I did not like when the editor shows the prophet Moses (pbuh). He should not have shown a person acting as the prophet. Theres no empirical evidence muslims have brains. We should ban them from breeding and spreading their disease called islam. Meanwhile, movies disparaging Jews arent even allowed. "
0,"Did Sheriff Clarke Just Reach Out To Advise, Assist Donald Trump? Sheriff David Clarke joined Neil Cavuto for a discussion on the recent outreach by Donald Trump to members of the black community, the respectable black community, not the race hustlers such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Cavuto starts by asking Sheriff Clarke if he was in attendance at the meeting, which he wasnt invited to, but he points out that whether or not he was at this one meeting does not have any relevance to the significance of Trumps outreach. He says the outreach is important, but I wouldnt go overboard. There is a diversity of thought that is growing within the black community across the United States. Its small right now, many are afraid to come out and state how they really feel because of the backlash. They see that I left the plantation, that I think for myself, and they see what happens to me. He continues, And so its going to take a little time, but Ill tell you what. I am glad to see that Donald Trump did not go groveling at the altar of Al Sharpton and pandering to him trying to get the black vote or trying to figure out whats going on in the black community from that charlatan. Cavuto asks why African-Americans, particularly the youths, so overwhelmingly vote Democrat. Sheriff Clarke attributes it in large part to ignorance of their history. He notes that post reconstruction blacks voted predominantly for the Republican Party because Lincoln freed the slaves. He also reminds the audience that it was the Democrats during the sixties who fought the Civil Rights Act and the Republicans who pushed it across the finish line. He points out that the Democrats created a false narrative, they put blinders over black peoples eyes, they separated them from their history and they created this false narrative that has been very appealing over time but it is a big lie. Sheriff Clarke says, Shame on the Republican Party, Neil, for during the last half century, just allowing that to happen and thinking that they didnt need the black vote, that they could win elections without it. That was a huge mistake, so were going to have to go back now and reconnect black folks with their history, tell them the real story of what political party freed the slaves and what political party gave blacks the advances and rights they do [have] today and its going to take some to do that. He adds, But Im here to lead that cause. That sounds like it might be an outreach of his own that the Sheriff is making to Mr. Trump; if hes listening.

0,"BREAKING NEWS: Kentucky State Trooper Shot and KILLED, Suspect 25 year old Black Male Another officer has fallen victim to the war on police, and a manhunt is underway for his killer. Foxnews.com: The Kentucky State Police say that one of its troopers who was only on the force for less than a year was shot and killed late Sunday after a traffic stop turned into a car chase. A statement released early Monday said that Trooper Joseph Cameron Ponder, 31, was pronounced dead at a Princeton, Ky., hospital after being shot multiple times.Ponder had been a state trooper since January of this year. The statement said that Ponder was conducting a traffic stop on the westbound side of Interstate 24 in the western part of the state at about 10:20 p.m. local time. The statement said that the driver who was being stopped took off from the scene, with Ponder pursuing him for approximately nine miles. At that point, according to the statement, the suspects car stopped short, causing Ponder to crash his car into the vehicle. Police say the driver, identified as 25-year-old Joseph Thomas Johnson-Shanks, got out of the car and started shooting at Ponder. Authorities say that Johnson-Shanks fled the scene on foot and is considered armed and dangerous. Hes described as a black man, standing approximately 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighing 140 pounds with brown eyes and black hair. He was last seen wearing dark clothing. Interstate 24 was shut down in both directions early Monday to assist in the search. No matter what the left says, the war on police is far from a right wing conspiracy. A new Rasmussen poll shows that blacks and whites both agree that the war on police is very real. While there is usually a wide racial difference of opinion on questions related to the police, most black voters (54%) agree with the majority of white (60%) and other minority voters (56%) that there is a war on police underway. FBI statistics show that 51 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2014. This is an increase of almost 89 percent when compared to the 27 officers killed in 2013. Preliminary datafor 2015 shows police killings are up 8%. UPDATE:Joseph Thomas Johnson-Shanks was found and taken into custody at 7:30 AM "

I am shocked and still have a hard time believing that Kerry and Obama are still moving forward with nuclear talks with Iran. I often ask myself do they love their kids or hate this country more. I am certain that most lawmakers in Washington love their children and grandchildren. Then why are traitors still living free in our society much less allowed to negotiate with Iran. Its only a matter of time before Iran has the bomb no thanks to the traitors in this administration.When Iran gets the bomb it is certain Al Qaeda will have the weapon. Washington seems to have forgotten the morning of 9-11 and all those who were lost. If it werent for the passengers of flight 93 a lot of these politicians wouldnt be here today. Most politicians are educated, but very few have any common sense. Iran gets nuclear weapons, its only a matter of time before Washington becomes a nuclear wasteland. Wake the hell up Washington or the last thing you will see is a big flash of light. Iran hates us just like many other terror organizations in this world. Obama and Kerry are mixing up company with those who wish to kill us while turning their backs on those who would die protecting us. They do not have our childrens future in their thoughts while kissing the ass of those who wish to destroy us. Remove these men from office before their friends remove all of us from this world. God bless America Semper Fi, Shep When Iran gets the bomb it is certain Al Qaeda will have the weapon is like Churchill saying in 1943: If Stalin gets the bomb, he will give it to Hitler, who will then nuke London! It makes absolutely no sense at all. Iran is shia-muslim nation. al-Qaeda and ISIS are sunni-muslim organizations, who hate the shias even more than they hate the west. ISIS is actually bombing shia mosques in Saudi-arabia already. If al-Qaeda or ISIS would get a nuke, it is more likely theyd use it on Iranian capital Tehran (to gain regional power) than that theyd use it against the west. Iran will not be so stupid as to give nukes to their enemies. Iran has a lot more to fear from us than we do from them after all, we overthrew their government in 1951 and we installed the Shah of Iran. Anyone who thinks that Iran is the aggressor has not read US/Iran history. Well, .you are either a militant muslim or far left liberal who hates the Jews. There is no basis whatsoever for your ignorant, hateful, racist slams against the Jewish people. Applicable Sure, Israel has some things they do that I would call them out on but for you to sit there and type that Iran would be a better ally than Israel is either blind ignorance of history or hate and arrogance towards America. I would also like to ask you why you specifically mentioned only whites and Christians. Are you thinking these two variables are your target audience in this thread and that mentioning specifics will insure you a bigger kill rate concerning your being antagonistic here? When you speak about only one race of people and a singular religion, its as if you have never seen anything of the world other than what someone else told you about or what to believe. No doubt that Iran already has the bomb, only question is where and when they will use it. DC GAZETTE CHASING ISLAM IS NOT A NUKE THREAT THE MATTER OF FACT THREAT IS RUSSIA FOR USA! RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN AGAIN WARNED NATO COUNTRIES TO STOP ARMING UKRAINE AND RUSSIAN SURROUNDING COUNTRIES OTHER WISE BE READY TO FACE OFF NUKE LOADED MISSILE IN THE RETALIATION?

PRESIDENT CARE ONLY TWO CRISIS ONE GLOBAL CRISIS ANOTHER LGBT AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES? GOP AND REPUBLICANS CARES HOW TO SUPPORT ISRAEL AND HOW TO PULL LEG OF PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM ? SO WHO WILL CARE NATION AND NATIONAL CRISIS ? Having lived in Israel, and having relatives high up in the Israeli military, I can tell you that Israel, since the 70s, has had nukes aimed at every major Muslim city in the Middle East. All the Muslim countries are afraid of Iran because they know that WHEN, NOT IF Iran launches against Israel the Middle East will cease to exist. The Saudis hate Israel, yet would let Israeli planes fly the shortcut over Saudi Arabia to destroy the seven underground labs making the Iranian nukes. What are you blathering about. There are 2 million Christian Israeli citizens. There are 2 million Muslim Israeli citizens. There are 4 million black and white Jewish Israeli citizens. All have equal religious freedom, equal free education, equal free healthcare and equal representation in Israels government. At 17 all those religions must serve in the Israeli army.The Muslim citizens are the envy of the Muslim world in the Middle East, for all their freedom. Stop being a low IQ, gullible, useful idiot for your white trash, white supremacist handlers. They need to be stopped while theres still time. They need to be arrested and hanged for treason. But it will not happen. This will continue until it all plays out. Nobody believes it because they dont want to. All I plan to do, therefore, is hunker down, provide for and defend my own till my last breath. If that breath comes while exercising my right to bear arms, then so be it. Others will surely pass with me. Unfortunately, they will have been forced into that position by tyrants. You people whose oath is to defend the Constitution better open your eyes. The globalist agents and anti-Americans in DC, want to be attacked so they, the traitors in DC, have an excuse to initiate martial law in the US and finally destroy the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and individuals freedoms, rights, and liberties so that their neo-feudalism and enslavement agenda can be completed. Yeah thats why Iranians were in the streets chanting death to America, the great satan..because they love us This water-carrying for Israel is getting embarrassing for you. Step away from the AIPAC boilerplate. Iran would make a better ally than Israel ever would. Israel despises Whitesdespises Christians. This is deeply ingrained in their nature.

0,"New Reports Of Protester Shot In Head By Police As Charlotte Erupts Michael McBride, who describes himself on Twitter as a pastor, has tweeted that he has received information from a demonstration in Charlotte, NC, informing him of the death of one of those demonstrating following the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. According to his information, the protester was shot in the head. In the information he received, also by way of tweet, the witness reported, shot in head by Charlotte police tonight. I was about ten feet away when it happened. It was an AMBUSH by the police. Please get the word out! McBride questioned him if it was confirmed, to which his source replied, Yes, I was right there. Not discounting the likelihood of someone being shot in the protests and the need for a full investigation to be conducted if that is the case, it is unlikely that police would ambush protesters in what is already an extremely volatile situation. That just doesnt make any sense, even if they were racists out to kill black people just for sport, which theyre not. A black man may have been killed and it may have been either a black or white officer who pulled the trigger. It also may have been justified. The officer who shot Scott was a black man who states he was dealing with a life or death decision. It is unlikely that they events happened as the witness described. Whether cooler, more thoughtful heads are able to prevail is a whole other issue. Unfortunately, the truth may not matter at first, when emotions and volatility are high.

This is by far one of the most disturbing videos I have ever viewed.David Stojcevski, a 32-year-old resident of Roseville, Michigan, was court ordered to spend 30 days in the Macomb County jail when he couldnt pay a$772 fine he received for careless driving. He was misdiagnosed and placed under self harm watch when he was actually suffering from withdrawals of drug addiction.Stojcevski had been seeing a doctor to beat addiction before entering the jail, and was prescribed methadone, xanax and Klonopin.For 17 daysStojcevski was left to suffer naked in a cell under 24 hour lighting while his cries for help went ignored. Stojcevski reportedly lost 50 pounds, suffered convulsions, and eventually began to hallucinate. Fusion.com reports details from a lawsuit being filed by the family. I warn you, this video may not be suitable for younger viewers Stojcevskis brother Vladimir is calling on the public to demand justice for this tragic death. On an obituary page set up for David Stojcevski, he wrote: ITS TIME SOMEONE STANDS UP AND IS THE VOICE BEHIND THIS AND YOU KNOW I WILL NOTTT STOP UNTIL WE GET TO THE FN VERY BOTTOM OF IT, OR TO THE VERY TOP OF IT. SHAME ON YOU ANIMALS!!! The Macomb County Sheriffs Department, which runs the jail, declined comment because of the pending litigation. "
0,"EPA Strikes Again: Another Mine Spill Accident This is becoming a habit with the screw-ups at the Environmental Protection Agency, an oxymoron if there ever was one with their recent track record. The dingbats triggered yet ANOTHER release of water contaminated with heavy metals into a small stream that feeds into a larger river that serves as a water source for people living in rural Colorado. This time the Standard Mine was upstream from Crested Butte, the stream is really more of a creek, and there were ONLY 2,000 gallons spilled rather than a few million, but does this sound familiar? From the Denver Post: The Standard Mine, five miles west of Crested Butte and abandoned, has been designated an environmental disaster since 2005 and targeted for a superfund cleanup. It is one of an estimated 230 inactive mines in Colorado that state officials know to be leaking toxic heavy metals into headwaters of the nations rivers. The spill happened at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, and the EPA said it immediately informed public works officials. Residents werent notified. Crested Butte Mayor Aaron Huckstep said he wasnt notified until Thursday. Subsequent investigation found no visible plume or signs of significant impacts in downstream locations, the EPA said. At the cleanup site, acidic wastewater laced with cancer-causing cadmium and other toxic heavy metals leaches out of the mine into Elk Creek, which flows into Coal Creek a primary source of water for Crested Butte. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has determined that the levels of arsenic, cadmium and zinc in Coal Creek exceed state standards. Yet again, the EPA is protecting the environment by using heavy equipment and disturbing the seepage at abandoned mining sites that were at least locally dealt with before the EPA decided to clean them up. In this case, EPA crew members were drilling a new opening at the mine, parallel to a portal that is partially collapsed. They were using a vacuum truck to siphon water from a waste pond, but the truck dipped too low, the EPAs statement said, causing grey-colored water from inside the mine and sediment to spill into Elk Creek. Adding insult to injury, the EPA told public works officials, but not the residents or officials higher up on the food chain who could actually get word out to the public quickly. This is a bad habit the EPA has of not telling the whole truth to the people most effected by the messes they make. With this EPA protecting the environment even if abandoned mines are seeping heavy metals into the headwaters in Colorado, one has to wonder what the real goal of the clean-up superfund is really get the heavy metals out of the water or make that part of Colorado uninhabitable.

0,"Clinton Brain Damage FBI Defense Disqualifies Her From Being President According to documents released by the FBI regarding their questioning of Hillary Clinton, it is fairly obvious that she wanted the FBI to believe she was too overwhelmed by the details of her work as Secretary of State to be held accountable for the consequences of her actions. The reason for her inability to properly conduct the affairs of state on behalf of the United States, we are supposed to believe, was a fall in her home in December of 2012. She presents the case that the threats to national security and violations of federal law that occurred as a result of her reckless endangerment, careless handling and violations of procedures were not her fault, nor are the discrepancies in her accounting for her actions. They werent really lies; they were her best recollection or non-recollection as impacted by an unexpected impairment that resulted from the concussion and subsequent brain injury she sustained in her December fall. Clinton claimed in her July 2nd FBI interview and continues to claim to this date that she was unable to remember much of the events of her entire tenure as Secretary of State due to the brain damage she sustained in the fall and its complications. The lingering effects, she would have the FBI and the American people believe, prevent her from remembering and thereby make it impossible for her to offer an explanation as to what motivated her actions. She told FBI investigators she was still incapacitated to a significant degree by that event, that she could not and still cannot answer 26 important questions related to their investigation. While she is incapable of remembering major events that took place during her term as Secretary of State, including some as basic as whether or not she and her staff received the briefing on the proper handling of classified materials, Clinton wants to assure us that she is simultaneously fully capable of handling the more difficult job of being president of the United States. She was not able to and evidence indicates had no desire to, responsibly conduct the business of the State Department even before she was injured. Her focus appeared, from information that is being uncovered by released emails, to have been upon making money selling access and influence. Those are the kind of things shed probably want to be able to claim she forgot as part of an investigation into her criminal wrong-doing. The problem for Mrs. Clinton is that she cannot make those claims without simultaneously disqualifying herself from being able to perform the duties of the office of President of the United States. If shes not able to do the lesser job due to a physical condition that still exists, she has no business running for president. If shes not physically impaired then she lied to the FBI in addition to committing numerous other offenses and is likewise disqualified from seeking the office. Either way, the release of the documents should be sufficient to warrant Clintons dropping out of the race or her removal by the DNC. The problem is that being able to govern is not a concern of the Democrats; being able to become president is. As long as she can pull that one off, they couldnt care less about her ability to actually do the job. Its up to her opposition, specifically Mr. Trump, to eliminate her as a candidate, using the information that Mrs. Clinton continues to begrudgingly provide through subpoenas, court orders and FOIA requests. Mrs. Clinton claimed she was unable to remember the following: "

0,"Syrian Refugee Crisis or Stealth Jihad? Here is the TRUTH the Media Doesnt Want You to Know The liberal media is hiding the dangerous truth about the Syrian refugee crisis. There is a terrorist plot happening right before our very eyes, and we are welcoming it with open arms. Author Robert Spencer ofFront Page Magazineexplains, This is no longer just a refugee crisis. This is a hijrah. Hijrah is the Islamic doctrine of migration, which is a form of stealth jihad. To emigrate in the cause of Allah that is, to move to a new land in order to bring Islam there, is considered in Islam to be a highly meritorious act. Spencer continues, Evidence that this is a hijrah, not simply a humanitarian crisis, came last February, but was little noted at the time and almost immediately forgotten. The Islamic Statepublished a document entitled, Libya: The Strategic Gateway for the Islamic State. Gateway into Europe, that is: the document exhorted Muslims to go to Libya and cross from there as refugees into Europe. This document tells would-be jihadis that weapons from Gaddafis arsenal are plentiful and easy to obtain in Libya and that the country has a long coast and looks upon the southern Crusader states, which can be reached with ease by even a rudimentary boat. An ISIS operative confirmed that the Islamic state is using this refugee crisis to form a fifth column of Muslim fighters inside Western nations. The ISIS smuggler, revealed to BuzzFeed that the ongoing clandestine operation has been a complete success. Just wait, he smiled. Its our dream that there should be a caliphate not only in Syria but in all the world and we will have it soon, God willing. The operative said the undercover infiltration was the beginning of a larger plot to carry out revenge attacks in the West in retaliation for the US-led coalition airstrikes. You have to ask yourself, why have the five wealthiest Muslim nations refused to take in a single refugee? Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain, have closed their borders during this crisis. They argued that accepting large numbers of Syrians is a threat to their safety, as terrorists could be hiding within an influx of people. I wonder what they know that we dont. "
0,"Lou Dobbs - Romney, Ryan, GOP Elites Two Time Losers Swinging For Strike Three Lou Dobbs evisceratedthe Republican establishment, including Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney, over their naked elitism and treachery as it becomes more apparent with each passing day, proclamation and meeting just what they areup to. He points out how only two months ago Speaker Paul Ryan claimed that it was ridiculous to even discuss a contested convention, that was until he acknowledged that it is now likely in a stuttering, awkward foundation laying in which he seemed slightly uncomfortable with his own treachery. Dobbs has it figured out, he knows why the likelihood of a contested convention has increased, it because the elites want it that way. He notes that Ryan is talking out of both sides of his mouth, claiming on one side to be neutral while attacking and admonishing Donald Trump on the other. He notes that Ryan attended a Palm Beach conference which included major Republican donors, wealthy adversaries of Donald Trump. Dobbs also finds hypocrisy in the sudden decision by Mitt Romney to switch his support from his man of a week ago, John Kasich, to his latest flame, Ted Cruz. He quotes Romneys Facebook post in which he said, The only path that remains to nominate a Republican, rather than Mr. Trump, insinuating that Trump is not really a Republican, is to have an open convention. At this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible. Dobbs unloads on these snakes, saying, This is the bedrock stuff of a fancy establishment strategy, dont you think? This is the level of thinking that they are bringing to their task. And frankly, I think its inadequate to the task. Dobbs, a master of understatement says, Romney is a lot of things, but I wont mention all of them. He does mention one, though, cynical, which he says is right at the top of the Romney list. And yes, he is an embarrassment to all who would claim him, including, yes, the embarrassing establishment of the Republican Party. Lou asks, Who would listen to this man any longer on any subject, other than, of course, those folks meeting in Palm Beach, who have nothing to show for their two political efforts but two humiliating presidential election losses in a row? Perhaps, says Dobbs, just the political strategist toadies who feed on the crumbs that Romney and his like let fall from their table. All together, the establishment a sad bunch indeed.

0,"College Mental Neutering Program To Question, Deconstruct Toxic Masculinities How is it that in todays society, in the last few years, weve gone from marriage being between a man and a woman to sex having no role, from single sex rest rooms and locker rooms to mixed by self-declaration, from a military of men and women to a military of who knows what? Are we to believe that all of this radical change happened organically, or in a word the left finds offensive, naturally? The premise that the definitions of who we are that have been true over thousands of years, which are driven by our biology, just suddenly changed spontaneously is ridiculous. Something and someone is behind this perversion of our basic humanity and its being accelerated. Now the next shoe to drop comes in North Carolina. That state is already softened up and made ripe for the picking by the lefts response, much of it through financial attacks, to the states refusal to allow grown men to pretend theyre women in a rest room with real women and little girls. The next step is to further sissify todays men. Theyre already treading the deliberately gender-confused roadway with far more pronouns and mandated tolerance indoctrination than a healthy mind should be forced to deal with. Now this unfortunate generation of sexually confused lab rats is having state-sponsored mental neutering imposed upon them. An important component of any brainwashing program includes the misrepresentation of what it is. In this case, the program at Duke University in Chapel Hill, NC, is labeled constructive male allyship. The program is not constructive, their products are lesser males and they ally with each other probably out of a newfound or heightened sense of inadequacy or vulnerability. The man-hating program is a sexist attack on men, with the bias of the unhealthy, gender-confused and gender-distorted proponents immediately apparent as they outline their goals. They build upon the emasculation foundation and anti-white male rhetoric that has been embraced by colleges around the nation as part of the leftist social justice campaign. They claim a desire to provide a safe space where male students are able to question and deconstruct toxic masculinities. Now theyll be able to go into a room and ponder the notion of becoming a homosexual or a pretend girl, so they wont be so toxic, howproductive. Anyone who would sign up for this course voluntarily clearly has one foot in the pantyhose already. You might think that a program called the constructive male allyship would be run by men, who know something about being male. Not so, this nine-week farce is being put on by the The Duke University Womens Center as part of their Duke Mens Project. Would the Womens Center find it appropriate and unworthy of comment for a mens organization to be conducting the womens training, to similarly train macho lesbians to become more feminine and pleasing to them? Is that too much equality for them to stomach or be a party to? Its fine for them to create an army of Clay Aikens but theres no room for girls on that couch. The Womens Center identifies their goals on their website homepage as being dedicated to helping every woman at Duke become self-assured with a streetwise savvy that comes from actively engaging with the world. We welcome men and women alike who are committed to gender equity and social change. Having made that statement there are 23 individuals in photos directly above it, none of whom are males. On their Engaging in a Diverse World page, there are twenty individuals pictured. Two of them are male, only one could potentially be the dreaded white privileged male. Diversity and inclusion have a liberal definition at Duke. The man-haters said of their emasculation or de-masculation program, to coin a new term, Our purpose is twofold: to foster constructive male allyship, and to question and deconstruct toxic masculinities. The Duke Chronicle described the Duke Mens Project (did they intend mens as an abbreviation for menstration?) as a nine-week long, storytelling-based program starting Wednesday that aims to discuss masculinity, feminism and intersectionality. It hopes to create a space of brotherhood fellowship dedicated to interrogating male privilege and patriarchy. Thats all the proof a real man needs, this is a get together for fruit loops. They might as well bring their crochet hooks and needles so they can finish up that shawl for grandma. No man wants to sit around cackling and storytelling with a bunch of wimpy dudes. If they need as space dedicated to interrogating male privilege, theyre anti-white and anti-heteros seeking to use the system to advance their perversion-based agenda. Theyre also guaranteed to support Democrats. The naive little snowflakes state, We also understand how masculinity in its normative form alienates most if not all men, and recognize the part normative masculinity plays in alienating men and reproducing violence. They use the word normative, which means normal, to describe the type of man theyre trying to change. Their statement that normal masculinity alienates men is false. The opposite is true. Sighing, lisping, foot stomping little girly boys with their arms on their hips, the product of this idiocy, is what alienates and makes the skin crawl of real men. After claiming its not an anti-male re-education program the organizers went on to state, We want to deconstruct toxic masculinities to reconstruct healthier, more inclusive notions of masculinity. They added, We want to explore, dissect, and construct an intersectional understanding of masculinity and maleness, as well as to create destabilized spaces for those with privilege. That certainly sounds like re-education and a hatred for men, white, privileged men in particular. Its amazing that college tuition continues to go up. You couldnt pay me enough to enroll my son in one of these gender neutral liberal cesspools. No wonder so many millennials are so clueless, confused and ill-informed about just about everything in life.

0,"Blind-Sided Planned Parenthood Spins The Baby Body Parts Video Well, that didnt take long. The mainstream media has circled the wagons around Planned Parenthood and their senior medical director who was caught on video by actors with the Center for Medical Progress about a year ago describing how an abortion procedure can be altered to preserve internal organs of the baby. To say that the sight of the woman enthusiastically describing how she accomplishes her goals all while killing a living human and then what the value of the organs themselves is while drinking wine and eating salad was shocking is an understatement. Even the most ardent of abortion supporters about dropped their teeth at first. (Anyone else see Special Report that evening? Charles Lane was stunned.) One thing is for sure: NO ONE saw this coming. After initially not covering the news of the video itself, the mainstream media eventually gave it the time of day and in the last 24 hours pretty much parroted the Planned Parenthood multi-media releases and companion video claiming that anti-abortion extremists and conservative internet rags blew the whole thing out of proportion. Of course what Planned Parenthood is doing is legal. Besides, the video is heavily edited, just like Lila Roses stuff. (To which Ed Morrissey at HotAir points out that the entire video AND a transcript were released at the same time. Note to the harpies at Planned Parenthood: the content didnt change just because it was edited. People not under your spell understand that.) However, what should be and is most enlightening about the words of Doctor Deborah Nucatola as she describes extracting baby body parts from a mother, is outright admission that abortion kills a child. A baby. Something all of us were at one time. This is the fact that all members of the pro-life movement have been trying to convey for decades. Abortion kills. In plain language, a baby dies. Sometimes more than one. This is the reality that Planned Parenthood sidesteps with language like clump of cells and just a blastocyst and clinical terms. (Fetus is Latin for baby. Do these people think we are all so uneducated?) This is also the truth that physicians who take a pro-choice stance in regards to abortion side-step with clinical terms, thus allowing a foot in the door of accepting outright murder of a child in the womb. But, with this video, a truth that is exposed brought to light and illumined is the slippery slope of accepting one abomination after another the EXACT word Charles Krauthammer, a medical doctor by training and nominally a pro-choice one, used when he said that today its fetal parts, and eventually it will be infants. HOORAY! The concept of the ethical slope that goes downhill with the slighest chink in the armor is starting to sink in. When the video went viral, there was movement on Capitol Hill to further investigate Planned Parenthood and calls for their federal funding to be rescinded. There are at least three states reporting that they will be investigating. And all the mainstream media is interested in reporting seems to be legality even if medical ethicists are speaking out as to what the priorties should be regardless. CBS News found one physician who disagrees with the practice of trafficking fetal organs for research. Even if its done legally, medical ethicists question whether Planned Parenthood should be in the business of providing fetal tissue. Youve got to be sure that its the patient, the woman who is at the center of your concern and nothing else is diverting from that, Dr. Arthur Caplan of NYUs Langone Medical Center said. Supplying fetal tissue from the remains to third parties is diverting. I would not do it. If nothing else, the Center for Medical Progress releasing the video got the nation talking about abortion again from a number of angles. The disgust and revulsion so many people exhibited in the first 24 hours of the videos appearance is not likely to be wallpapered over by Planned Parenthood as thoroughly as they would like. What the investigations produce in the way of violations of the law is not going to effect gag reflexes across America as people try to keep down their dinner even thinking about what Nucatola described so casually, as if it were of no more consequence than a walk in the park.

0,"[Watch] Real James Foley or Imposter - Missing Scars, Different Facial Structures Raise Questions James Foley was known to have been sympathetic to the cause of those who have now apparently also become his murderers, but this first video does raise some interesting questions as to the identity of the victim in the ISIS video. While the American government has signed off on the authenticity of the ISIS video and supported their claims, there are several apparent inconsistencies in the physical appearance between previous images of James Foley and the man in the orange jumpsuit. The man in the orange jumpsuit sounds as if he is a spokesperson for ISIS and when speaking. He seems awfully calm and philosophical in his comments, and very resolute in his claims that the Americans are the real killers. He doesnt sound like someone under duress or someone who knows he is about to die in a most brutal manner. His strong condemnation of the acts of his brother and the use of the phrase that ship has sailed seem odd. It could well be true that Foley was killed as we have been told under exactly the reported, brutal method and circumstances. However, the CIA connection, the differences in appearance, his oft-stated pro-Islamist beliefs and the recognition that this was his second time in captivity give rise to a healthy skepticism. There is a difference in the color of the head afterwards as well as an absence of blood when the knife begins its cutting. Obviously, no autopsy was performed and any full length video which might have existed online has long-since been scrubbed. If the only version that exists is a faded out to black, sensitized one that is in itself inconsistent with the methods of the ISIS butchers. The intent of this article is not to dispute the claims of those who have more expertise and are more familiar with the purported victim, James Foley. Some questions need to be asked and the acknowledgement should be made that some things dont appear to add up. None of us know what is going on behind the scenes. In this instance, use of the terminology, behind the scenes could be a very appropriate way to describe what has transpired.

0,"The Questions Cecile Richards Of Planned Parenthood WASNT Asked Yesterday, after sitting through the full morning of Republican offensive and Democrat defensive questions and commentary to Cecile Richards, President of PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF AMERICA, not all the doggone affiliates, this writer registered her dismay at the Republican effort. Frankly, it was more about throwing red meat to the conservative base than getting questions answered. We all know that Planned Parenthood doesnt do mammograms. Getting Cecile Richards to admit that was no great feat. The president of any organization does not set the price of his or her compensation. That is done at the board of directors level. (And in Ms. Richards case, $500,000 might be considered combat pay.) The big time questioning of and answers about parties and lavish private travel needs to come from the board itself and the non-governmental big time donors whose cash is being used for this. None of those people were witnesses to be questioned. Bringing up unseemly spending makes great headlines, but was completely beside the point. To be honest, John McCormack is correct in his Weekly Standard piece How Not To Make Planned Parenthood Squirm. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, doomed the hearing from the start when he took any questioning of the revelations from the Center for Medical Progress videos off the table. Because of that, no one could ask: If Planned Parenthood officials and the Democrats just want to talk about legality, then start there. (The moral side of the question will never be settled in a committee hearing, anyway.) Those were topics openly discussed in the videos and the justification for all of it is what WILL make somebody on the hot seat from Planned Parenthood squirm, not discussion of questionable spending. It is quite possible all that pre-dates Ms. Richards time at Planned Parenthood, and if so, its obviously part of the institutional culture. (Thats a matter for another post, hiding evil in the shadows.) When it comes to the financial side of the house, there is a lot of noise about the $500 million that goes to the AFFILIATES, not the 501(c)(3) that Richards actually runs, that is reimbursement for medicaid payments. Once the paper trail at the state and affiliate level is sorted out, and we see just how much the safety net that Planned Parenthood provides costs, why are the poor and indigent being served with medicaid dollars for this? As a charity, Ms. Richards discussed fundraising and how successful the people of Planned Parenthood are at it. So the question in finance that did not get asked is: With amazing name recognition from coast to coast, why not go the mass market fundraiser route, a la, walks, bike rides, marathons, 3-day events, that so many other health care related non-profits have, in order to raise the money to be able to offer the poor these services at no cost to them or the taxpayers? Having been part of these events at one of the national disease related charities, it can be arranged for each affiliate to keep the cash locally, especially since they are all separate entities anyway. Software to make it all happen easily is commercially available. Staffing needs can be met quite easily with a skeleton crew and volunteers. (Thats how everyone does it.) What is stopping Planned Parenthood from going this route? No one asked that question, at least not in that form. (The answer is most likely bad press in the form of protests, but still.) Specifics on the grants to the national organization werent requested, either. At least not that I saw. There should be reports to the government available outlining how the money was spent. More or less, the meat and potatoes of this matter is still on the platter to be devoured. The videos themselves provide grist for the moral mill and for people who believe in the sanctity of life, but thats not for a congressional committee to do much more than expose. The change of heart on that has to come from the people. The law so touted by the pro-death people was imposed, not legislated. Cecile Richards, or somebody else at Planned Parenthood, still has not answered the big questions. The bigger conundrum iswill someone actually ask them? "
0,"MMA Sensation Ronda Rousey: I Try to Have as Much Sex as POSSIBLE... [Source1/Source2] VideoSource gifSource Check out Ronda Rouseys 9 SEXIEST PICSBYParis Seude From biography.com Ronda Jean Rousey was born on February 1, 1987, in Riverside, California. Born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck, Rousey nearly died from a lack of oxygen and sustained slight brain damage, which impeded her ability to speak an intelligible word until she was 6. A tragedy fell upon the family when Rouseys dad, Ron, broke his back while sledding with his daughters. A blood disorder prevented him from healing properly, and after learning he would be a paraplegic in the few years he had left to live, he committed suicide when Rousey was 8. Rousey struggled in class and was homeschooled for parts of elementary and high school, but she found an outlet for her frustration when her mom, AnnMaria De Mars, persuaded her to learn judo. A gold medalwinning judoka at the 1984 World Championships, De Mars began drilling her daughter in some of the sports fundamentals, most notably the dreaded armbar used to pin an opponent to the mat. Rousey was named to the United States Olympic team at age 15, and at 16 she became the youngest American to earn the national No. 1 ranking in the womens half-middleweight division. Although she didnt earn a medal at the 2004 Olympics, she claimed gold at that years World Junior and Pan American Judo Championships. After defending her Pan American Judo Championship title in 2006, Rousey became the first American woman in 12 years to earn a World Championship medal by finishing second in the 2007 tournament. She then won gold at the 2007 Pan American Games, despite a torn knee meniscus. After earning the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, she retired from judo at age 21. Unsure of what to do in the wake of her judo career, Rousey worked as a bartender and lived out of her car for a spell in Los Angeles. She eventually joined the Glendale Fighting Club and in August 2010 made her amateur debut in mixed martial arts, a victory by way of an armbar after just 23 seconds. Two more amateur bouts ended via armbar submission after 57 and 24 seconds, respectively. Rousey continued her run of domination after turning pro in the sport, reeling off four straight wins in under a minute apiece. In March 2012, she became the Strikeforce Womens Bantamweight Champion by defeating Miesha Tate in four minutes and 27 seconds. By this point, Rousey had become a crossover star with her good looks and penchant for first trash-talking and then brutally dispatching her opponents. She was featured on a cover ofESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue, and appeared as a guest on Conan OBriens talk show. After one more speedy victory, Rousey was the first woman to sign with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the worlds largest mixed martial arts league. Designated Bantamweight Champion, she successfully defended her belt in the inaugural UFC womens bout in February 2012, submitting Liz Carmouche via her patented armbar in four minutes and 49 seconds, her longest fight at that point. In the summer of 2013, Rousey appeared in another sexy photo spread, forMaxim, and announced plans to star in the action filmsThe Expendables 3(released in 2014) andFurious 7(2015).At the end of 2013, she won a rematch with Tate that extended to the third round, suggestingshe was losing her touch as the dominant force of the UFC womens circuit. However, Rousey recorded a first-round win in her following bout, and then proceeded to crush her next two opponents in a combined time of 30 seconds. With her 34-second demolition of Bethe Correia in August 2015, it was clear Rousey remained in a class of her own as a fighter. by: American Godfather "
0,"Cops ANGRY: Mayor Keeps BLM Banner On City Hall- What He Tells Them Is Unbelievable! Cops ANGRY: Mayor Keeps BLM Banner On City Hall Take it down! That was the chant heard at a rally outside the Somerville, Mass city hall on Thursday. Law enforcement officers and their supporters were protesting the continued display of a Black Lives Matter banner on the buildings facade. Democratic Mayor Joe Curtatone, however, has turned a deaf ear to their voices. In fact, he has vowed that the removal will not happen on his watch. That sign is not coming down, he stated emphatically. Ironically, he made this promise while standing with police as guards on either side of him. Anybody else feel like coughing out the word hypocrite? One of the unions represented was The Somerville Police Employees Association. The groups president, Michael McGrath, made clear his feelings on the banner. In the face of the continuing assassination of innocent police officers across the country it is irresponsible of the city to publicly declare support Mayor Curtatone doesnt agree. He place the 4 x 12 banner on city hall last August and insists it stays. According to him, it helps bring to light the fact that structural racism exists in society. This paragon of common sense backed up his decision in a statement. Too many people have died in a cycle of violence that needs to be stopped. Apparently, Curtatone feels that the banner hanging on police headquarters justifies the leaving up of this one. That banner was hung in support of the officers recently slaughtered. It reads: In honor and remembrance. Pictured on it is a badge with a black band across it. The ever-astute mayor said Both of those banners are hanging for the same reason. Seriously? Do you have to fail an IQ test to qualify for his job? The police union sent a formal request to the mayor last week. They asked that the banner be replaced by one that read All Lives Matter. The request was flatly denied. Evidently that saying diminishes concerns about the killings of black men and boys at the hands of police. It would seem, however, that not all gag reflexes matter.

0,"UN Preparing US For Black Reparations, Racist Santa Claus Obamas Next Job We would all like to think that when Obamas illegal occupation of the White House ends in January well be free of him. The only way that will happen is if he and his comrades are in prison. As he stated himself in remarks a couple of weeks ago while addressing the racist Congressional Black Caucus, Obama is just getting started. He plans to be a hemorrhoid on Americas backsides for a long time. He promised Hes just getting started. As a globalist and America-hater, Obama has always perceived the legitimate power as residing not as is laid out in the Constitution but with the United Nations and a dictatorial president that implements global interests and ignores our tradition, our structure, everything about the United States as being archaic and no longer applicable. The way he ignores our immigration laws and sidesteps Congress in favor of UN approval on the Iran giveaway and the climate extortion agreements are obvious examples. He sought out and received the blessing of the UN and declared that to be sufficient. The gutless Congress, bought off or simply cowardly, has done nothing to rein in this rogue authoritarian. Having already undercut what were normalized and improving race relations in America by fomenting uprisings and chaos in association with George Soros and his front organizations like Black Lives Matter, Obama is taking that dissent and building on it. Hes doing so once again through the UN, an organization which he is likely to hold a high position in after we are rid of him, even if it has to be created for him. After all, theyre all phony positions when you get right down to it. The foundation is being laid for demands of wealth redistribution, in line with the Marxist model the fascist globalist overlords are using to impose world government, for reparations to black people from the US Treasury. A raiding of the treasury by the globalists in the creation of their world government. Even that egregious act will be a stepping stone on the way to similar climate reparations to the world that are already part of the COP21 UN Climate Hoax Agreement and the Sustainable Development, Agenda 2030 agreements, both signed last year. Our treasury is pledged to developing nations to compensate them for our sins of prosperity. Now comes word that a UN-affiliated group in Geneva has issued a report which calls for the US to hand money over to black Americans as reparations for slavery. The group of intrusive international busy-bodies is the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. They report to the same piece of trash globalist, a prince in the loosest definition of the word, from Jordan. Hes a Muslim, a member of a group that considers women to be lesser than men and persecutes homosexuals and those of different religions, who practice genital mutilation, honor killings and other atrocities as part of their daily existence, sitting in judgment of good, civilized and decent Americans. His name is Zeid Raad Al Hussein, a humanitarian Islamic terrorist, who just last week threatened those who dont accept his dictates and roll over to the Islamic invasion in a speech during the UN General Assembly. He labeled those who value the sovereignty of their nations as xenophobes and bigots who would identified, shamed and judged by his people. The group of so-called experts is made up of leading human rights lawyers from around the world. They presented their propaganda as a link between the U.S.s history of slavery and present injustices, such as the recent police shootings of African Americans to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Monday. This is not the first action in this regard, they sent a special envoy to tour America with Soros Black Lives Matter agitators for seventeen days, making him an expert on the racist US. It wasnt that tough, he already had his opinion before he got here. The most recent report is just part of the mosaic of attacking positions that will be used at a future time. They wrote, In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. It added, Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching. This sounds like some people who need a visit to Saudi Arabia or Sudan for an injection of some balance into their judgment. They went on to say that the shootings of police during the past year, which they choose to ignore are at levels lower than those of white criminals, have caused a human rights crisis that needs to be urgently addressed. They compared the shootings of criminals, most of which were armed and many who were threatening police officers to the lynchings by white supremacists in the late 1800s. A law degree obviously doesnt come packaged with honesty, integrity, discernment or intellect. They recommended possible reparations such as a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation. In a side note that indicates that lack of objectivity of the group, one panel member, Ricardo Sunga, presumably on the side of border crashing invaders, given his Hispanic name and therefore anti-Trump, was asked about the presidential election. He responded with the typical leftist remarks about hate speech xenophobia (and) Afrophobia prevalent in the race, but did not call out any candidates by name. Hes willing to throw the darts and insults but too much of a coward to specifically identify Mr. Trump. Well see where this nonsense goes, but clearly it is being done for a purpose. A foundation is being laid and we will never be free of the Saul Alinsky radical Obama until he is imprisoned for his treason. That will be a very result of a Trump victory, along with a similar fate for his opponent.

0,"Scientists Restore Mans Sight Imagine being in the darkest place possible, where you cant see even the slightest bit of the hand in front of your face. Now imagine being stuck in that darkness for half your life. Sixty-six-year-old Larry Hester has been in that place for the past 33 years. In his mid-thirties, Hester was diagnosed with a hereditary degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. This disease causes the light-sensitive retinas to deteriorate. It has no known cure. On September 10, Larry became the seventh recipient in the country of a bionic eye implant, a.k.a. Second Sight Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Device. This device consists of a chip implanted into the eye, a video camera, and special glasses worn by the patient. It captures video on the camera mounted onto the glasses, translating it into an electrical signal. The signal gets wirelessly sent to the chip connected to the part of the retina that is undamaged. Once the signal reaches the chip, the brain interprets it as contrasting pieces of light and dark. Patrick Finnerty of Second Sight Medical Products explains it this way: The patient can see flashes of light and a pixelated type of vision that helps him distinguish between objects in his field of view. Dr. Paul Hahn, Hesters eye surgeon, explained that although it does not give the patient full vision like most people are used to having, it does help him navigate around doors, windows, etc. After weeks of recovery, Hester returned to Duke Eye Center on October 7 to start therapy. A video broadcast by Duke captures the moment when Dr. Hahn turned the device on, the first time since the device was implanted. Cheers went up when Hester immediately flinched at the sudden light. Smiles and hugs were given all around as Hester continued meeting the test standards. Doctors and family members alike joined hands in a circle for a moment of prayer, led by a humble and truly grateful Larry Hester. Its so basic; and to anybody else it would be just flashes of light, but to me it meansI can see, Hester said, breaking down in tears as he was interviewed after the test. This is very special. This is a gift. Family members walked him outside to see the moon for the first time in 30 years. So far, he has been able to see light-colored flowers against brown mulch, and a white duck on a pond. He is hoping that by next summer he will be able to see the light contrasts of the Fourth of July fireworks in his hometown. For now, he only turns the device on for about half an hour per day to let his brain adjust to having vision after half a lifetime of blindness. Jerry Hester, Larrys wife, spoke with reporters after the tests: We have prayed a lot about it, our friends and family have, and we have a wonderful support group of people that are cheering for himSeeing a bit of Gods creation that weve had this opportunity, a second chance thats a special time.

0,"NOT GUILTY! BALTIMORE POLICE PREPARE FOR UNREST - NO EVIDENCE FOUND to Charge Officer Goodsen in Freddie Gray Murder Trial Protesting has already begun in Baltimore streets with people shouting no justice no peace and jail killers. Baltimore Police Chief has cancelled all leave for officers today preparing for possible rioting, while Baltimores Mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked that citizens to be patient and to allow the entire process to come to a conclusion. However angry crowds are reported to be growing by the minute.Charges against Baltimore Police Officer Caesar Goodson, Jr. were much more serious than the previous two trials of Officer William Porter that ended in a hung jury and mistrial and that of Officer Edward Nero, ending in an acquittal. From DeRay Mckesson, Black Lives Matter activist and former mayoral candidate: This is a disappointing verdict. I look forward to the remaining trials. The verdict today is a reminder that the current laws, policies and practices protect police behavior at all costs. The work to create systems and structures that hold police accountable continues. Freddie Gray should be alive today. Prosecutors left the courtroom with their proverbial tails between their legs after Judge Williams questioned prosecutors about the basis for their case in the first place and their reasons for believing the defendantculpable at all (somewhat similar to being called to the Principals office). Video evidence even showed the police van obeying stop signs and traffic lights with only two minor infractions: 1) not coming to one complete stop and 2) slightly crossing a yellow traffic line. The latter infraction actually reduced centrifugal forces on Freddie Gray having the fortuitous result of making the alleged rough ride less jolting for Gray. This decision is another HUGE defeat for prosecutor Marilyn Mosby and could potentially have an impact on her future career. Attorneys for the Defendant had widely argued the prosecutors grossly overcharged Officer Goodson. Prosecutor Mosby supported these charges against Goodson, who was found NOT GUILTY OF ALL FOLLOWING CHARGES: Judge Williams will be presiding over the trials of the remaining three police officers thathave yet to begin.Officer Goodson stillfaces an administrative review by the Police Department.

0,"Trumps Presidential Speech - Hes Obama and Clintons Worst Nightmare Donald Trump often declares himself to be Hillary Clintons worst nightmare. From the content of his speech on Wednesday its obvious hes also a bad dream come true for Hussein Obama. In fact, he could be described as the anti-Obama, intent on undoing the incredible damage inflicted upon our nation by the Marxist foreign imposter. Trump vowed to put US security above all else, blasphemy against the legacy of Obama, the anti-American. Mr. Trump said, America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. I will be Americas greatest defender and most loyal champion. No American citizen will ever feel that their needs come second to a citizen of a foreign country. That again is a sharp contrast to the globalist, global citizen, UN worship that has spewed like the foul contents of a broken sewer line from the Oval Office for the last seven years. He added, Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. Mr. Trump said, The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we have had the exact opposite a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy. Trump vowed he would use military strength if necessary, he also emphasized restraint, that it was not our role to get involved automatically, particularly when our national interests would be adversely affected. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. Im skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and under my administration we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. While he cited NAFTA as an example, the globalist ears around the world must have heard their latest assaults, TPP and TTIP as well. Trump said, Weve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. He said, I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton. Using a teleprompter, the more disciplined Trump stressed a desire for regional stability not radical change in the Middle East. He spoke to ISIS as well, saying, Simple message for ISIS: Their days are numbered. I wont tell them where, I wont tell them how, [but] ISIS will be gone if Im elected president and they will be gone quickly. He pointed out, We are in a war with radical Islam, but President Obama wont name the enemy. He called out the Obama regime for their mistreatment of our great friend, Israel, and for the increased threat that results from Obamas Iran giveaway. While Trump noted that he would call summit meetings with NATO allies and separate meetings with Asian allies to confront our shared challenges, he left no doubt that they would be required to Pay their fair share and that an unwillingness to do so could result in less support from the US. He also said, I will not hesitate to deploy military force if there is no alternative, but if America fights, it must always fight to win. The current nonsensical rules of engagement are headed for the burn pile. Mr. Trump had some criticism of our post-Cold War foreign policy, saying, Unfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya to President Obamas line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions has helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. He took a shot at the pathetic pretend president, saying, President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing trade deals and [to] apply leverage on China necessary to reign in North Korea. Obama has been concerned about his legacy lately and trying to write it into something it isnt. Clearly, Donald Trump is going to play a major role in crafting the narrative of Obamas horrific impact upon our nation and the world and in taking corrective action to mitigate the wholly negative consequences of his time in office. Mr. Trump starts speaking at the 6:38 point in the video below: Im Rick Wells a constitutional conservative writer who recognizes that our nation, our Constitution and our traditions are under a full scale assault from multiple threats.

0,"Media Fossil Goes After Carly Fiorina On Planned Parenthood This writer will make no bones about her trepidation when it comes to Carly Fiorina actually being president of the United States. However, the one statement she made at the CNN debate last week that rang amazingly true, and does explain quite a bit about the leftist denial about the resurgence in the national discussion on abortion, was her statement which was essentially volunteered on Planned Parenthood: Having watched all the videos in question, this writer knew that the part about the live child was not accurate. One video does have a still photo of a baby that died and miscarried. There is no actual footage of killing. But there is footage of technicians going through fetal remains and identifying the pieces and parts. Of course, THAT inaccuracy set off a round of attempts to bury Carly Fiorina from the American leftist media with the implication that Planned Parenthood isnt really selling baby parts. (If it wasnt a sale, why the negotiation? The price should be fixed based on a monetary formula. Jeez.) Where Fiorina was right on this was in saying that if anyone on the left had actually WATCHED the videos, they would understand that the accusations have merit. Who barters over the price of a fetal liver and still has a soul? And that is what makes attacks by people likeEleanor Clift?!so absurd. This is what she had to say over the weekend on the McLaughlin Group. She played real fast and loose, though, with the facts around Planned Parenthood and I think shes really is overreaching in the criticism shes making of an organization that millions of women in this country have gotten services from. And to imply that they are selling and harvesting and selling baby parts that doesnt bear out with the facts and I think its really offensive. Once the gentle reader unscrunches his or her face and realizes that the McLaughlin Group is STILL ON THE AIR despite being a relic of the 80s, we can all join in the chorus that says, Eleanor, you didnt watch the videos. And THAT is the point that Fiorina made and the leftist media is proving for her in their attacks. They didnt watch the videos. Period. If they did, they would realize that Fiorina has a point even if the price per body part is cloaked in the term compensation either for collection or shipping, and that Fiorina took artistic license with her descriptions. Ad hominem attacks on the Center for Medical Progress for their tactics in collecting the footage doesnt change the nature of the discussion. Planned Parenthood is working to provide researchers with tissue procured by abortion in exchange for cash. Doesnt matter that they cloak it in other terms and euphemisms, thats what is going on. And ultimately, the question does remain: what kind of country allows this to happen? H/T NewsBusters "
0,"Ed Klein: Bill And Hillary Argue About Her Health A Lot - WATCH When the video of Hillary Clinton collapsing at the September 11 memorial first surfaced, a scene from Ed Kleins book The Amateur flashed. It was toward the beginning when Bill and Hillary Clinton were arguing over whether or not she should run for president in 2012. He argued that she should do it then because Barack Obama was an amateur and she wasnt getting any younger. She argued that she had plenty of time. Its turning out that Bill Clinton was right. And not only that, according to Ed Kleins contacts, Bill has known about Hillarys fragile health for years, and cant get her to get a full medical work-up. (One wasnt done in 2012 when she had the blood clot?) This is what the king of Washington, D.C., gossip-mongers had to say on Fox and Friends this morning. Anyone who has really objectively followed the Hillary Clinton health story this election year can well believe Mr. Kleins account regardless of his use of unnamed sources, and his hawking a new book. We have seen Hillary Clinton fall multiple times, not just the famous fall that put her in New York Presbyterian Hospitalwith a concussion four years ago. According to a new Daily Mail report, the woman had a blood clot in 1998, and lied to her staff about it. Now we are finding out from friends and colleagues that that falling, fainting and not being able to walk up stairs is a regular occurrence, hence Bill Clintons concern and fury. Bill Clintons motivation to convince his consort to get a full medical workup can be motivated by any number of factors. It would be nice for it to be concern, but one email released today from a Colin Powell stash indicates his eyes still wander. The Clintons are really all about power and Hillary not being able to return to the White House as president extinguishes the possibility that Bill will ever live at that address again. Sources are now coming out of the woodwork to confirm what experienced eyes spotted in the September 11 video the Secret Service acted like this happens all the time. Were now finding out that it does, and pneumonia and dehydration are nowhere close to the extent of Hillarys health problems. "
0,"U.S. Internet Surrender Stalled Saying that the international agreement for the United States of America to sign over control of the internet from its ownership needs more work,Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Lawrence E. Strickling wrote in a blog post Monday that surrender of the internet to international forces will be put off for at least a year, and the currentagreement withnonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) might well be renewed for an additional three years. When we announced our intent in March 2014 to complete the privatization of the DNS, we noted that the base period of our contract with ICANN to perform technical functions related to the DNS, known as the IANA functions, expired on September 30, 2015. However, it has become increasingly apparent over the last few months that the community needs time to complete its work, have the plan reviewed by the U.S. Government and then implement it if it is approved. Accordingly, in May we asked the groups developing the transition documents how long it would take to finish and implement their proposals. After factoring in time for public comment, U.S. Government evaluation and implementation of the proposals, the community estimated it could take until at least September 2016 to complete this process. In response to their feedback, we informed Congress on Friday that we plan to extend our IANA contract with ICANN for one year to September 30, 2016. Beyond 2016, we have options to extend the contract for up to three additional years if needed. Extend ICANNs contract if neededgiven the goals of this group as outlined by the New York Times: The Commerce Department said the new governing body could not be a government-led or intergovernmental organization. It also stipulated that the new group must maintain the structure and stability of the domain name system, along with the openness of the Internet. May as well just hand it over to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, then. Its either him or the United Nations if the intention is to keep it running and even then the internet being as free and open as it is is iffy. The United States is one of the few countries that actually believes in the concept of free speech. So, handover of one of the USAs true technological achievements to forces that may well want to destroy us has been postponed. Strickling seems to think the outstanding issues and public commentary can be dealt with in the next yearbut has a contract extension in his back pocket if necessary. Any takers on this handover being postponed until a Republican is in the White House and then the executive order torn up? Yeah, me neither. "
0,"[Watch] Amnesty and Open Borders Becoming Obamas Katrina - No Safety Hiding in Texas Fundraisers The gullible fools in the national mainstream media are absolutely amazing. These are grown adults who presumable make rational decisions every day of their lives, and yet they are nave enough to consume the shovelfuls of manure being served up by the Obama regime without batting an eye or asking the most obvious, rational question. This Washington Post expert talks about the problem at the border with the kids as if it is an inevitable situation and something other than an orchestrated creation of the Obama regime. Hes completely taken the bait, swallowed the hook, been reeled in and is ready to be mounted on the wall. He, for all of his Washington connections, wisdom and insight, is completely blind to the reality in front of his face. In fairness, his name is Balz, not Brains, so maybe hes just doing the best he can with what hes got. Adhering to a simple principle of following the money would at a minimum create a reasonable doubt that this is just the random acts of many desperate central American peasants. They dont have any money and just like a trip to Rome or that new Cadillac that isnt parking in the dirt road in front of their shacks, they cant afford to pay the smugglers to get to America. It isnt a simple spontaneous response any more than Benghazi was a response to a video. Its orchestrated and the money to fund it is coming from elsewhere. They are right about one thing, this is going to blow up in Obamas arrogant totalitarian snout. We are seeing the beginnings of that already. As usual, hes pretending its a phony scandal, ignoring what he cant explain away, only its not having the usual effect. The people, at least those outside of the mainstream media, are starting to question the inherent wisdom of the community organizer who would be king. Once the plagues of disease and pestilence that his imported democrats are unlesashing become more evident, hes going to have more than he can handle keeping his peasants in place. They are calling it Obamas Katrina. Obama can pray to whatever golden idol or owl statue that he worships that this disaster of his creation doesnt get any bigger than Katrina. This storm appears to be much larger, of greater intensity and much more devastating than its Bush predecessor. Its stalled over the southern border for now, but with his dispersal of infected persons throughout the country, its only a matter of time before a full blown epidemic of some sort grips the nation. Add to that the revolt among patriots who have had enough of their subjugation to foreigners, and thiscould be the beginning of Obamas end. He doesnt need to go to the border. What could he say other than look at the mess I made?He should just continue to fund raise and golf. Its only national security. DHS and the media will cover for him.

0,"Soros To Hillary: Clean Up On Aisle 9 - ONE ORDER FROM THE PUPPETMASTER The title on the story at The Blaze reads, Newly Released Emails Reveal Billionaire Donor George Soros Sent Clinton Foreign Policy Advice. Read the actual email as George Soros himself wrote it, and one gets the impression that this wasnt really advice. It was more like marching orders. Dear Hillary, A serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at senior levels of the US government. You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property. There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party on Wednesday and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims. The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the countrys fragile democratic process. I believe two things need to be done urgently: 1. Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements. 2. Appoint a senior European official as a mediator. While I am concerned about the rhetoric being used by both sides, I am particularly worried about the actions of the Prime Minister. There is videotape of National Guard members firing on demonstrators from the roof of the Prime Ministry. The Prosecutor (appointed by the Democratic Party) has issued arrest warrants for the individuals in question. The Prime Minister had previously accused the opposition of intentionally murdering these activists as a provocation. After the tape came out deputies from his party accused the Prosecutor of planning a coup detat in collaboration with the opposition, a charge Mr. Berisha repeated today. No arrests have been made as of this writing. The demonstration resulted from opposition protests over the conduct of parliamentary elections in 2009. The political environment has deteriorated ever since and is now approaching levels of 1997, when similar issues caused the country to slide into anarchy and violence. There are signs that Edi Ramas control of his own people is slipping, which may lead to further violence. The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this, but given Albanias European aspirations the EU must take the lead. That is why I suggest appointing a mediator such as Carl Bildt. Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak, all of whom have strong connections to the Balkans. My foundation in Tirana is monitoring the situation closely and can provide independent analysis of the crisis. Thank you, George Soros Three days later, Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, appointed Miroslav Lajcak as mediator for the Albanian situation. What was actually happening in January of 2011 to prompt this missive from Soros regarding a tiny Islamic European country that sits between Greece and the nations that were once thrown together in the form of Yugoslavia along the Adriatic Sea, obviously would have upset some sort of plan Soros had at the time. He desperately needed the unrest to go away. That being the case, he writes Hillary via channels at the State Department (heres the Wikileaks link for the email) and she does his bidding even if the situation really was more of a European problem. Interesting. Whats more interesting is that this email chain appears within the 2011-2012 time frame of Hillarys emails that the State Department appears not to have. The emails themselves were buried in a cache of Hillarys finest published by Wikileaks in March of 2016. The sources of the text actually were not Hillarys email itself, but state.gov addresses of her underlings. The way THOSE emails read, it appears that they were follow-ups to other communications. As scintillating reading as the Hillary Clinton email cache must be (ZZZZZ) one does have to admit that these delicious bombshells make wading through them worth it. Even if all thats happening is conformation of what so many people have suspected for years. "
0,"Days Of Clinton Media Free Rein To Attack Trump And Cover Her Crimes Now Over Hillary Clintons CNN was out in full force, once again overreacting to a comment by Donald Trump in order to divert attention from their criminal candidate. On this day they were able to ignore her having the father of the Orlando terrorist onstage with her at one of her rallies and the latest proof of her selling favors while Secretary of State. Lemon is enjoying himself, laughing as he asks the questions of his panelists as they join each other in their familiar practice of Trump bashing. Then he got to Dan Bongino who doesnt share their agenda and doesnt see anything amusing about what theyre doing. Not everybody believes that a political propaganda and entertainment organization should be allowed to peddle itself as a news network. Many dont find anything cute or humorous in their anti-American misrepresentations and flogging of politically advantageous non-issues. Its amazing that David Gergen, supposedly a great legal mind, can question on-air the belief that Hillary Clinton is a criminal but he does it multiple times. Clearly his bread is buttered by the same folks who take care of Lemon. Bongino gets into a spirited debate with Lemon over his biased coverage, how he came into the discussion with a bias against Trump, calling him Captain Talking Point. Bongino isnt going to back down and tells Lemon to go ahead and cut his mic if he wants to, as he has been known to do in the past to those who stand up with opposing, not officially approved views. Bongino may not get invited back on CNN and if not he certainly made his last appearance memorable. There are more than a few people in America who enjoyed watching Don Lemon get slapped down. Its just unfortunate he didnt get a chance to include Gergen, the attorney who doesnt understand the concept of criminality, in his beat down. "
0,"BLACK RAGE: Baton Rouge Resident Asks Where Is #BlackLivesMatter - Viral Video It is almost sad to watch the truth sink in. Its bittersweet to see those who raised their fists with #BlackLivesMatter figure out that lives only matter to BLM when it suits their purposes. And it is really sad when an every day citizen broadcasts over the internet the stark reality that a flooded American city is pretty much on its own right now. One Baton Rouge, Louisiana, resident shot a selfie video that just about says it all on this topic. The mans name appears to be Jerry Washington. His heartbreak and the anger resulting from it is obvious for anyone who has eyes to see. Mr. Washington nailed that last statement. At this point, most emotionally uninvolved people recognize that #BlackLivesMatter is an orchestrated attempt to whip up the people who are oppressed and unprivileged into a frenzy to produce as much mayhem as possible. It is a strategy to create fear, loathing, and tear at the fibers to bind society. Unfortunately for that movement, in the United States, anyway, natural disasters bring people together as we all help each other get through it. That is what we are seeing in Baton Rouge, and that is what the blacks there were somewhat expecting from the movement that told them they were more than just a number. But it isnt that movement helping. Its the people who know what it feels like to be flooded out. Its the local authorities. Its the Red Cross disaster crews. Its the National Guard. As awful as it is to see the disillusionment on the faces of people who have been betrayed and used, at least they are seeing the light, and the reality of what #BlackLivesMatter thinks of them. "
0,"This Poll Is Giving Hillary Campaign Heartburn (Can You Say Landslide?) Political theater and gaslighting being what it is, one pollfrom the Benson Strategy Group for the Clinton Foundation may just be a $100 dragged through a trailer park, but it is compelling none the less. See, contrary to what the professional pollsters with all the scientific methods are telling us, according to data in a seven page report labeled Do Not Distribute, Do Not Copy Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton 77% to 19%. Any way a reader looks at it, those are landslide numbers. From the Executive Summary: Interviews with 2,021 adult Americans conducted by telephone by BSG on October 10-13, 2016. The margin of sampling error for resultsbased on the total sample is plus or minus 2 percentage points. The sample uses a LVS based on voting history (65%), self-attestation (12%),social-media data mining (10%), demographic / socio-economic class (18%). This sample includes 1101 interviews among landlinerespondents and 920 interviews among cell phone respondents. NO SKEWS OR NARRATIVE SCREENS WERE EMPLOYED That means, that unlike the scientific polls, this one is not weighted or tilted one way or another to give a predetermined result. Quite the contrary. The data sample is larger and includes both landlines and mobile. Official polls generally only use land lines. The simple results in this poll are: 62% of people are claiming to be voting for Trump and their minds are made up and that number has momentum, something else the people at Benson Strategy Group noted. At this point Donald Trump has both momentum and enthusiasm. Distrust in the mainstream media is blunting the impact of thecollective polling narrative. As Election Day approaches, Hillary Clintons favorable ratings have crashed to historic lows (12%) in nonpartisansand Donald Trump is consolidating support (97% of LV Republican-identifying respondents are either enthusiastic or veryenthusiastic about voting for Trump). Also of note: Among independents, Hillary voters who are exposed to any alternative media (73%) are aware of the WikiLeaks emails and find themeither disturbing (54%) or deeply disturbing (18%). Among liberal-identifying whites, support is shifting from Hillary (-27 since October1st) to Donald Trump (78%) or Jill Stein (21%).

0,"Wikileaks Assange On Clintons Russia Experts Julian Assange of Wikileaks is interviewed by Democracy Now shortly after the release of the first tranche of DNC documents. He covers a wide-range of topics, starting with the relationship between the Clinton campaign and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. He says, It is important for there to be examples of accountability, the resignation was an example of that. He then notes that immediately thereafter, Hillary Clinton made a counter-example of her own. Her hiring of Schultzin a fabricated management position is a message being sent not to the voters, but to political operatives. That messaging, Assange says, is If you act in a corrupt way that benefits Hillary Clinton, youll be taken care of. He identifies the most significant emails as being ones that show the financial mechanisms behind the DNC, the pay for play system in which everything has a price. Saying, Those are very rich documents, Assange identifies one in particular called Spreadsheet of all things. He notes there were some interesting, circuitous routes in which money traveled, including from the DNC to the states and back that he believes may have been used to disguise the flow of money in order to violate some sort of restrictions. He addresses the clear campaign and atmosphere of a commitment to defeating Bernie Sanders within the DNC. He also notes that Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the president of MSNBC and ordered him to come down on the Morning Joe program with them subsequently doing a 180 degree turn on their stated position. He also dismisses the claims by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mooks that the Russians are involved in the email dump. Hes asked for the source of the document by the interviewer and refuses, reminding her that they pride themselves on never releasing their sources. He notes that the definition of expert utilized by the Clinton campaign is a very generous one, as he is familiar with one of them. Theyve got a nickname for the guy as hes been trying to construct a conspiracy theory against them since the Edward Snowden days. Assange points out how the DNC is an open book that has been hacked repeatedly and there are many potential sources. The Clinton campaign doesnt know what theyre talking about. Then again, they know what was in their email and may be running damage control in anticipation. "

A man in Florida is upset after his niece brought home a waiver asking parents to sign a waiver and return it to the schoolif they would like their child to be excused from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. In frustration, Micah Brienen took to Facebook last Thursday. Brienens sister-in-law returned the form with her daughter, writing the following in response: Several days later, Brienen followed up his initial post with one asking his friends tocontact the schools superintendent about the issue and letting them know that he is up for reelection. It is being forgotten that we are in America, people coming in need to adapt to American traditions! We should not be sending waivers home allowing anyone to be excused for any reason. When you come in this country to become an AMERICAN, you change to American ways. Not the other way around, this is exactly what is wrong with this country now. We keep changing all our ways to please everyone coming in. Soon we will not have any ways of America left, we will just be like every country that everyone supposedly was so scared of and had to flee from.

0,"Scientists Fill In The Periodic Table A Little, Bask In The Glow This weeks news from the world of chemistry gives new meaning to whipping up something in the lab. No, the science crazy sorts did not invent a woman, or some reasonable facsimile, they quite literally invented, uh, discovered four new elements, and added them to the Periodic Table. The elements, discovered by scientists in Japan, Russia and America, are the first to be added to the table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were added. The four were verified on 30 December by the US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the global organisation that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement. IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the Riken institute inJapan. This was The Guardians version. CNN gave away the true secret of the invention, uh, discoveries: With the words decay extremely quickly it can be extrapolated that the quartet are radioactive, or at least start out that way. (113 is said to be more radioactive than Plutonium.) That they fill in the seventh row of the Periodic Table makes them heavy. Anything at the bottom is a heavy atom, in this case superheavy. (Gases go across the top, as do natural elements that make up the building blocks of life. Lighter than air and all that.) That they arent naturalwho cares. Chemists are on to elements 119 and 120 which dont exist yet. The four new colors, oops, elements are ununtrium, (Uut or element 113), ununpentium (Uup, element 115), ununseptium (Uus, element 117), and ununoctium (Uuo, element 118), although those will not be their real names until theInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) finalizes the names. Exactly what these elements will be used for is anyones guess. In the meantime, the scientific community is positively orgasmic at the development that is considered on par with Olympic gold metals, and one would have to assume, sex. At least their good news has nothing to do with the Kardashians. "

0,"The Body Part Cruz Has That Trump Doesnt- The Proof Is Undeniable There is one, glaring difference between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. It is a major body part that Cruz seems to have that Trump seems to lack. The body part I am discussing is a spine. It is a backbone. Not the literal one, of course, but the figurative one that allows a person to stand up for what they believe in. Trump may talk tough, but thats all it is, talk. Cruz is the only one of the two candidates who has had the fortitude to defend what he believes is right and vehemently oppose what he believes is wrong. This is not just one authors opinion. The facts speak for themselves. Cruz has always been against Obamacare. He spoke for 21 straight hours on the Senate floor in order to keep it from receiving funding. Thats 21 hours without a single break to fight a system he felt was harmful to Americans. When Obama was trying to cram an immigration initiative down our throats, it was Ted Cruz who made an 11th hour stand that forced the Senate into a Saturday session. More recently, he took on Planned Parenthood with gusto. When Republican and Democratic leaders were trying to pass a quickie spending bill, Ted called for a vote on a bill that would defund the organization. He faced off with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the Export- Import Bank. He even called him a liar on the Senate floor. He willingness to defy convention, and his fellow lawmakers, has not earned him any friends in Washington. That is not what Cruz is there for, though. His mission is to guard the American people from donor driven decisions and policies that dont protect them. And then, theres Trump. Donald Trumps goal seems to be the furtherance of Donald Trump. His invertebrate antics on the campaign trail prove that. His defense of a specific stance only lasts as long as it is the popular belief to hold. The moment his current view goes out of favor with the public, he backs down and changes it to reflect whatever will get him another atta boy from the crowd. Think Im being biased? Lets look. Trump used to be pro-choice. Now that hes running on the Republican ticket, hes pro-life. He was once in favor of a ban on assault weapons. He is now against it. In 2002 he told Howard Stern he thought invading Iraq was a good idea. Since thats not popular anymore, he is touting his opposition to it. Just since beginning his campaign, he has flip-flopped. He was all in for torture of captured ISIS fighters one day and called it unlawful the next. On H-1B visas, Trump has reversed himself twice. When it comes to Syrian refugees, he has been ambivalent as well. First he said about taking them in that on a humanitarian basis, you have to. While on the trail, however, he stated If I win, theyre going out. Is it really safe to elect a man who doesnt have the backbone to say This is what I believe. PERIOD!? Can we truly say that we would be better off by putting someone in office who is more concerned with popularity than policy? Only one of the two has demonstrated that he not a political mollusk. It is that man, Ted Cruz, who we should choose to lead our nation. 2016 Vianna Vaughan "

0,"Why Arent Secret Service Miscreants Being Fired? Congress Hasnt Exempted Them From Federal Labor Laws Sometimes, Congressional hearings do actually do some good. See, Congress has had it with the Secret Service. Several members from both sides of the aisle want the agency to let the people who have been causing all the scandal go. Quickly. From the Washington Examiner: You have got to have a system that has robust accountability, Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., insisted at a hearing earlier this week. And thats the question that were looking at today, where is the accountability in the agency? It just seems throughout this saga with different problems, theres no swift accountability. There needs to be rapid response in these incidents we cant put this into a bureaucratic process where I get an answer in eight weeks or 10 weeks, Rep. Steve Lynch, D-Mass., told Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy. The vast majority of the private sector in the United States works this way, but it seems that the federal government without an exemption that the Secret Service does not have does not. attorneys who specialize in federal labor law say Secret Service employees, after their first three years of probation, are part of the competitive civil service and guaranteed a series of due-process rights that the agency cannot simply ignore. Although other agencies are exempt from that system, legislation making that change for the Secret Service has not materialized. So, heres a quandary for Congress: there is an agency charged with protecting the president and his family at all costs, there have been appalling breaches in the ability to successfully execute that task of late, and no one will lose his or her job just yet because there is an entire due process protocol that must be followed because Secret Service agents are federal employees, and they havent gotten through it yet. In order to change this, and exempt the agency from those particular labor laws (as has happened in other security related departments and agencies), Congress must pass legislation to change the law. Otherwise, the directors hands are tied, and all the hearings in the world will not change that. In last weeks hearing where Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy was grilled as to what in the heck is going on within a department he was brought in to clean up, Rep. Jon Mica (R-FL) sympathized with him. Well, hell, you dont have the ability to command, because your hands are tied by Title 5, Mica said during Tuesdays hearing, referring to the law that lays out the competitive service protections. You cant hire and fire. You have to go through this layer. I chaired the Civil Service subcommittee, he said, And I know how difficult it is to get rid of folks, even discipline folks. Most people are just moved horizontally to some other position. So, cutting Mr. Clancy and his predecessor Julia Pierson who did request that legislation changing the Title 5 problems be produced a little slack on this would be in order. Mr. Clancy DID put the agents who ran an SUV into an active crime scene on moderated assignment and he did refer the case directly to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General for investigation. That was the proper way to go given the circumstances. From the commentary attributed to labor specialists and lawyers, it looks like fixing the scandal issues at the Secret Service need to start with Congress, and the Foggy Bottom Theater fireworks should take a back seat to actually changing the law to give the Director the tools he needs to get the job done. If Mr. Clancy does not use those tools, then go after him. "
0,"Scientists Have Simulated Time Travel With Photons... quantum particle travels through a wormhole back in time and returns to the same location in space and time / Martin Ringbauer Looks like time travel is possible for particles of light. Using a photon, physicists have managed to simulate quantum particles traveling through time. Studying the photons behavior could help scientists understand some inexplicable aspects of modern physics. The question of time travel features at the interface between two of our most successful yet incompatible physical theories Einsteins general relativity and quantum mechanics, University of Queenslands Martin Ringbauer says in a news release:. Time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast you move relative to another object. Einsteins theory suggests the possibility of traveling backwards in time by following a space-time path that returns to the starting point in space but at an earlier time. This is called a closed timelike curve (pictured above). Its a traversable wormhole. In a quantum regime, the authors say, the paradox of time travel can be resolved, leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. Near a black hole, for example, the extreme effects of general relativity play a role. Pictured above, a space-time structure exhibiting closed paths in space (horizontal) and time (vertical). A quantum particle travels through a wormhole back in time and returns to the same location in space and time. These include the violation of Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, cracking of quantum cryptography, and perfect cloning of quantum states. The work was published in Nature Communications this week.

0,"The Hillary Clinton Secrets (Ed Klein Has A List And Is Sending Smoke Signals) Just about all sane Americans are watching the Hillary Clinton machine clank and whistle on its way to the finish line of the Democratic Party Nominee for president. Four years ago, it was quite a shock to anyone who had been paying attention that she didnt run for the same position in 2012. Author and all around gossip whore Ed Klein described a scene in his anti-Obama rant titled The Amateur (fascinating trash reading) from 2011 where Bill and Hillary Clinton got into an argument over whether or not she would be too old to endure the rigors of the campaign trail for 2016. Bill said it was time to shoot crap in 2012. Hillary wanted to wait. As it happens, the delicate hot house flower should have listened to her husband. Fast forward to 2015 and we in the USA are knee deep in the pre-election jockeying for position, sort of like the NASCAR silly season, only it goes on for months on end and the country is drained when its all over. Barring an actual indictment by a federal grand jury and no pardon from the Obama White House, Bill Clintons wife will actually be the Democratic nominee for president. Theres no question of that. Yes, we have public evidence of multiple felonies that would send anyone else to a Club Fed for the rest of their natural lives, but this is Hillary. (Her just reward will most likely not be during her earthly life.) With that in mind, Mr. Klein has decided to publish Five Dirty Little Secrets About Hillary That The Media Isnt Talking About for all to consider. The Townhall piece is really a teaser for his new book, but in addition to the misdeeds we all know about, there are some other scandals that just arent out there with any regularity: Hillarys Health This one surfaces every now and then, and anyone who looks at the bags under her eyes and understands that they are an external sign of sky-high blood pressure will believe Klein when he says shes having blinding headaches. With that in mind, the idea that she had a blood clot in the brain is not so unbelievable. That Bill would be concerned enough for her to suggest traveling with a physicianyou decide. Hillarys Son In Law Its been pretty buried, but the insinuation that Marc Mezvinsky takes full advantage of his Clinton connection to raise cash for his hedge fund is not new by any means. That hes going through cash like water is another matter. (Its a freekin hedge fund. They do that.) Valerie Jarrett and the Obama White House Investigated Hillary Oh, really? Its not just that they dont like her and she defied orders on not just being involved with Sidney Blumenthal, but by having the separate email server? Now Klein is telling us that Valerie Jarrett had her investigated on a number of fronts. (If they really wanted to get rid of Hillary why didnt they make a big deal about this? It would have been quite entertaining to watch the news media try to decide which side to defend. Valerie should have jumped up and down and made a scene.) The GOP Candidate Who Scares Bill Forget who scares Hillary. She cant politic her way out of a paper bag. Its Bills opinion here thats important. And the one who scares him is Marco Rubio. Of course, that was when everyone thought the Donald Trump train was going to derail, but still, Rubio is quite popular as a second choice and he has appeal for a number of perfectly superficial reasons that Bill Clinton understands at a gut level. Aside from that, Rubio actually understands the concept of foreign policy, recognizes that Washington cant be changed from the inside, and has some truly rational ideas for how to do things. (Looks, brains, and generational appeal is a dangerous combination.) As for the other scandal that Ed Klein finds vital enough to include in his tabloid presentation, the collusion of the Clinton Foundation and foreign governments while Hillary was Secretary of Stateunfortunately, the people out there on the fruited plain are more concerned with Lamar Odom and Ronda Rousey (whoever they are) to pay much attention to the reality that while she was Secretary of State, not only did Bill Clinton get heaps o cash for giving speeches here there and everywhere, but sweetheart deals as described in the book Clinton Cash poured money into the Foundation and enriched the Clintons all at the same time. What Ed Klein is absolutely correct about is that just one of these scandals would be enough to sink just about anyone else. But the Clintons are different. They can and do just brazen their way past anyone who raises the specter of scandaleven if its true and theres proof of the misdeeds. The mainstream mass medias silence on any one or all of these topics isnt just deafening, its a dereliction of duty. Other than the threat of bad publicity what exactly WILL keep people like the Clintons from ethical violations? Its the job of the media/press/talking heads to expose all of this, and it just isnt happening. "

Thank goodness for cameras! 23-year old Deanna Griego was pulled over for driving drunk. She is a very attractive girl and no doubt she has used that to her advantage in the past. She did her best to try to use her looks and charm on Officer Jared Frazier, but it didnt work. The Officer Frazier did his job, and he did it well. He was even nice enough to let her use the station restroom. While in the restroom Officer Frazier overheard her talking, and he remembered that she slipped her cell phone into her bra during the sobriety test. She was on the phone asking the person on the other end of the line, How can I get this officer in trouble? He opened the bathroom door, but not to the point where he could actually see her. He simply told her to get off the phone. She began yelling about the Officer violating her rights by opening the door. She then accused the Officer of touching her inappropriately. The only problem was; he was wearing a lapel pin, and it was all on camera. He told her, The whole things on video maam; you can say whatever you like. Unfortunately, the police department said that Griego would not face any charges beyond the DWI. They were worried that pressing charges against her would discourage real sexual assault victims from speaking up. However, they did issue a statement about the incident, The desire to frame officers for wrongdoing is a growing issue facing officers every day. We believe that the public should be held accountable for filing false reports against police officers. These incidents can be very damaging to an officers career, so we hope that this individual and others face appropriate consequences for their malicious actions. This girl is more than lucky that she isnt being charged for her false allegations. If Officer Frazier did not wear that camera, his whole life could have been ruined. Deanna Griego may not face charges for disgusting behavior, but hopefully she will be publicly shamed by this video. "

0,"New Obama Move: Less Military Surplus Equipment Headed To Local Police As promised after the riots and unrest in multiple locations in the last ten months in the United States, the Obama White House announced that the program that allows for transfer of military surplus items to local police departments will have less to offer the LEOs. On the chopping block: To be made available to SOME departments after they certify and promise to use it responsibly with permission from local government: This information comes via a report titled The Presidents Task Force on 21st Century Policing. It is part of a project the Administration has been working on for some time. Obama had this to say about the report and the bans. Weve seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them, Obama said during remarks in Camden, N.J. Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments. No one is going to argue that, however there seems to be some disconnect between what the Obama White House is describing about police sentiment and what the police are actually saying. From Politico: Were doing these things because were listening to what law enforcement is telling us, Obama said. So were going to prohibit equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments, he said, while for other items, the administration would ensure officers have appropriate training. James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, on the other hand, said: The issue of militarization has been really kind of exaggerated almost to the point that I dont recognize it at times. The vast majority of the equipment that civilian law enforcement gets from the military is administrative stuff or defensive in nature. In addtion, Pasco told Politico: The FOP is the most aggressive law enforcement advocacy group in Washington, and we will be at our most aggressive in asserting the need for officer safety and officer rights in any police changes that are to be effected, Pasco said. He said in particular he objects to a measure that would require police departments to get permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs. We need to only look back to Baltimore to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation, he said. Because you dont like the optics, you cant send police officers out to be hurt or killed. Pasco is hoping to have a meeting with White House officials this week to discuss the changes in the program. The surprise announcement of the paper and its recommendations came in Camden, New Jersey where Barack Obama was touting the strategy and plan to help local police departments by spending $75 million to buy 50,000 body cameras and get more officers on the beat. Reaction from liberal lawmakers was positive and from civil rights advocacy groups measured. Across the board, comments were about appearances rather than actual effective safety for police officers and the public they serve. How optics are going to make any of us more safe is a matter not talked about. Writers note: this move by the White House may well bethe latest in bringing local police under federal guidelines.

0,"Reid - His Duty To Attack Trump On Senate Floor Because He Thinks Hes Wrong Some poor unfortunate kids grumpy old grandpa was interviewed by CNN and he was even able to find fault and take serious exception with their extremely favorable election reporting. Obviously Harry Reid has more than just that half-opened eye as a souvenir of being attacked by a rubber band, hes got Hillary Clinton-style mental problems of his own to deal with as well. As if to prove that point, Reid declared that Donald Trump would never be elected president of the United States. The Democrats, he says, will also be retaking the Senate. With the horrible job of representing the people the Republicans have done, their penchant for surrender and their complete abdication of their oaths and duty to the American people and our nation, it wouldnt be surprising. But the prospect of the old one-eyed pirates party being in charge again should help to motivate Republicans to get out and support Donald Trump as well as keeping the wolves out of our hen house. Reid says All of these polls are a joke, we know he cant be elected president. Looking at the levels of support, enthusiasm and their candidates daily corruption reports, Reid does seem to be quite delusional. When hes reminded by the interviewer that the polls are tightening, Reid says its because CNN gets cheap polls that they can manipulate for ratings. Reid says he has an obligation to tell everyone who will listen to him, to make sure they understand that he is not a person of quality. Thats quality as defined by a scumbag whos profiteered his way to millionaire wealth as a lifetime politician peddling influence and making deals. Even more humorous is Harry Reid describing anyone other than himself as a bully and an egomaniac. He says Trump was born into wealth and has no concept of what its like to have to work for a living. Trump can work and does work circles around most of us, in spite of not having to or not having a concept of what it means. He works because he wants to, Harry. And he didnt have to steal from his country or abuse his office and peddle influence to get his money, unlike a certain mush-mouthed curmudgeon has. Reid is asked if its okay for him to go on the Senate floor and make political attacks rather than conducting the peoples business as he is supposed to be doing. Reid says its okay for him, because of his superior enlightenment and his obligation as the Democrat leader to point out things that are wrong. He says he has an obligation to go after people that I think are wrong. Theres nothing in the Constitution that gives him that responsibility but Democrats dont pay much attention to what they see as that old outdated document anyway. His new establishment soul mate, if Reid had a soul, Mitt Romney and he are now on the same page about Donald Trumps tax returns, a defection that Reid considers validation of his abuse of office. Asked a final question about Clintons shaky position in the polls, Reid says, You listen to me and proceeds to blame the low budget CNN polls once again for her slide. Its not a matter of dishonesty or her health issues, her profiteering and selling her office in a manner that makes Reid and every other Democrat jealous. Voters dont care about that stuff, according to Reid, and legitimate polls would prove it. Reid will never be the same, and there was nothing good about him to start with.

0,"[Video] The Mystery of 9-11, Dr. Graham, and Jamal Khan An intriguing mystery indeed, so I did a little research. . Local Terrorist Whistle-Blower Dead After Poisoning Dr. Grahams Obituary read in part: SHREVEPORT, LA Dr. David Graham was born in Shreveport, LA. He was born May 21, 1939 and passed away Sunday, September 17, 2006 in Shreveport, LA following a lengthy illness. Dr. Graham was 67. The other part of this tale is Jamal Khan. When Mohammad Jamal Khan pleaded guilty to trying to evade the requirement that large cash transactions be reported to banks and the government, federal prosecutors added an unusual caveat to his plea agreement: There would be no immunity from possible prosecution in the future for crimes relating to Sept. 11. The agreement adds: The U.S. Attorney is simply not aware of the involvement by the defendant in these crimes at this time. What is interesting to me is that the FBI never disputed the possibility that Dr. Grahams meetings and suspicions about the 9-11 hijackers were true. Or that they were hosted by Jamal Khan. They only disputed Dr. Grahams timeline of when he actually reported the meetings to the FBI. And by adding that little tidbit to Jamal Khans plea bargain it appears that the FBI was very interested in Jamal Khans possible involvement with the planning of the 9-11 attacks. And what has happened to the apparent money launderer and gracious host to hijackers, the mysterious Pakistani Jamal Khan? Is he in the Witness Protection Program? Did the CIA quietly ship him off for questioning? Did he really skip the country and go underground? And, if so, why did the FBI let this man covered with the bloody fingerprints of 9-11 slip away? Now over a decade later Khan is still missing and the mystery remains unsolved. DFV ended his intriguing mystery story with these words: And since Jonah Goldberg (National Review online) first highlighted this story by asking Whatever happened to the anthrax investigation (yeah, whatever DID happen to that???)one final question: Just how many subplots, sub plotters, co-conspirators, accomplices, go-betweens, money men, facilitators, collaborators, and confederates had a hand in the 9/11 attacks. and how many of those still lurk stealthily somewhere in the catacombs of international intrigue? Doctor Grahams murder remains unsolved and uninvestigated to this day and this may very well be a mystery that is never solved. You can now read his unpublished book The 9/11 Graham Report online and decide for yourself if his story rings true. "

She names a long list of scandals and serious situations which the regime has inflicted upon America, reminding us that while the world falls in around him, Obama is golfing and fundraising, at the very time with a fashion queen. She asks Brit Hume if she was in error on any of it and he says while hes unable to disagree with any of the inclusions she made in her argument, there was one omission he feels compelled to include, that of our failing economy. Hume says he hates to say it, but the Obama regime has been a failed presidency. She then moves on to the arrest of Abu Khatalla, asking why are we bringing him to American soil to be tried where he will receive Miranda rights and other benefits that would not be available to him in Gitmo. Her guest is Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as the Homeland Security Committee. He says the reason that Khatalla is being brought to the United States for trial is simply because Obama is going to make matters worse once again. Now, with this odd choice of venue, there will be a substantially reduced opportunity to gather intelligence information, once again Obama putting politics, his commitment to close Gitmo, ahead of responsible leadership. She also gives airtime to the questioning by James Rosen of State Department Spokeswoman, who talks her way around the answer as to why it took 642 days to arrest Abu Khattala when reporters were able to interview him without much difficulty, and how she fails after three attempts to provide a straight answer to his question.

Gohmert has still refused to endorse his partys candidate, as if there is some moral nobility in being a sore loser that effectively provides Hillary Clinton with support. He replied following a noticeable hesitation, The main thing that I heard that I loved him saying was were going to enforce the law.' Varney notes that Trump is not saying round them all up and chuck every one of them out, hes not saying that. He went out last night and said look, some can stay, I think he said the good ones can stay, the ones we want can stay. Thats a softening. So youre okay with it, what about his hard core supporters? Gohmert makes his point, saying, Im okay with enforcing the law. Thats whats got to happen and Im glad hes realized what Obama has ignored and that is the fact weve got good laws in place that Obama has just refused to enforce and Hillary is, shes going to do the same thing. Varney asks Gohmert if he likes the new Donald Trump. The Ted Cruz supporter who wouldnt demand that his Canadian non-citizen candidate prove that hes an American citizen, has insisted Trump apologize to Cruz over the Oswald comments in order to receive his blessing. Careful, Congressman, your hypocrisy as a selective tough law and order guy is showing. Gohmert said, I love hearing Im going to enforce the laws. I havent heard him say hes not going to build the wall. So as long as Trump builds the wall and enforces the law hes okay with Trump. But hes still going to continue to throw his tantrum with Calgary Ted. He also reminds Varney that the supposed deportation force already exists in ICE. They just need leadership that will allow them to do their job rather than prevent or forbidding them from doing it. "
0,"CLINTON TELEPROMPTER INSIDE DEBATE PODIUM - Exposed By Network Video There were just too many cameras out of their control for their little plan to work. The question is not only one of Clinton cheating, we all expected that, but of the greater conspiracy which included those responsible for holding the debate and construction of the podiums. One podium seems to have been outfitted with a special light that the other didnt have and it appears that the light was functioning as a teleprompter to give Mrs. Clinton answers that she couldnt keep in her addled old brain. Its really hard to memorize things or have timely recall when youre taking heavy medications for a mystery illness. The natural solution for a Clinton and the Democrats is to cheat. To do that by putting a teleprompter into the stage would have required the services of some technicians, carpenters, and its procurement as well as the blessing and complicity of the leftists at the Commission on Presidential Debates. It would also have required the questions in advance so the information could be prepared for insertion and feeding to the cheater on stage. For that to happen Lester and his employers would have had to have provided the questions or possibly merely have received the questions selected by the Clinton campaign. Somethings definitely up. You can see, as the video vividly demonstrates, a light in the Clinton podium that does not exist in the Trump podium. Its also undeniable that it is turned off as the event comes to a close, though not in a timely enough manner so as to prevent discovery. There is really no other explanation, as described in the video, for the light showing up in the manner it does on only one podium. So lets hear it, Clinton camp and NBC, tell us how were a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists and how you werent in cahoots with the Commission to turn the debates to their girl Hillary.

0," New research suggests that one of the more popular antidepressants, Paxil, may actually contribute to the growth of cancerous tumors in women. That's according to a team of scientists from the City of Hope in Duarte, California, which has developed a quick way to zero in on drugs and chemicals that are capable of disrupting human sex hormones and influencing the development and progression of diseases, like breast cancer in women. As reported by the Los Angeles Times : In a trial screening of 446 drugs in wide circulation, the new assay singled out the popular antidepressant paroxetine (better known by its commercial name, Paxil) as having a weak estrogenic effect that could promote the development and growth of breast tumors in women. The finding is important because as much as 25 percent of women who are under treatment for breast cancer suffer from depression, and that's a condition regularly treated with antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, like Paxil (which has been on the market for 22 years). Furthermore, the study showed, nearly a quarter of all women in the U.S. in their 40s and 50s are on some form of antidepressant, mostly SSRIs. Other medications also have a similar negative effect on estrogen The Times reported that, last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a low-dose paroxetine, which has been repackaged under the trade name Brisdelle, as a treatment for hot flashes and other menopause-related problems that is also non-hormonal. Some 70 percent of breast cancers in women are estrogen-sensitive, which means that a hormone found in abundance in childbearing-aged females actually contributes to the growth of cancerous tumors. The unique screening method that was developed at City of Hope, which was detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Toxicological Sciences , also identified a pair of antifungal drugs -- biconazole and oxyconazole -- as having a negative effect on estrogen that was similar to that of medications prescribed to prevent breast cancer and stop it from recurring in women. More from the Times : Incidental to their intended use in combating fungal infections, those medications inhibit the action of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens -- hormones more plentiful in males but present in both sexes -- into estrogen. Less surprising, the high-throughput screening mechanism identified bisphenol A -- a compound used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins -- as an estrogen promoter capable of raising breast cancer risk. The finding that Paxil has an endocrine-altering effect may provide insight to cancer researchers regarding their increased suspicions of medication in women with breast cancer. In 2010, for example, a study found that breast cancer patients in Canada who were prescribed Paxil were more likely than those who had been given a different antidepressant to die of breast cancer, 'when there was a substantial overlap in their use of that antidepressant and of tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer recurrence,' the Times reported. The researchers believed that paroxetine -- taken by about one-fourth of cancer patients in the study who had been diagnosed with depression -- might block the production of a liver enzyme that scientists say is necessary to break down tamoxifen. The authors of this latest study said that paroxetine's 'weak estrogenic' effect 'may be responsible, in part, for the observed reduction' in tamoxifen's effectiveness in the study. As a class of drugs, SSRIs have proven to be quite controversial, as we have documented for years here at selfnews . Among the most controversial: -- SSRIs have been linked to birth defects, complications during pregnancy and even miscarriages. 'Big Pharma wants pregnant women to take prescription drugs, vaccine shots and even chemotherapy. It's the latest insanity from an industry that kills more Americans ever year than died in the entire Vietnam War. And the latest science reveals that antidepressant use during pregnancy is causing babies to be born with physical defects -- or sometimes not born at all because they're miscarried' [ http://www.selfnews.com ]. -- Studies have shown that women who take SSRIs during pregnancy run a higher risk of developing pulmonary persistent hypertension (high blood pressure) [ http://www.selfnews.com ]. -- And there is this: Studies suggest that SSRIs -- which are prescribed ostensibly to 'treat' depression -- may lead to more suicides among patients taking them [ http://www.selfnews.com ].

0," Hundreds of Alaska Airlines flight attendants have filed a formal complaint about uniforms they suspect might be causing their skin to rash and develop lesions, and their hair to fall out. But based on the timing of the symptoms and their relation to similar symptoms in local marine life and polar bear populations, it appears as though radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster may also be a potential culprit. KING 5 News in Seattle, Wash., first broke the news about the 'mystery illness' that has reportedly affected at least 280 flight attendants thus far. According to accounts, those afflicted by the condition say they have developed persistently itchy skin, skin lesions, and hair loss, all of which they suspect may have to do with newer flight uniforms that allegedly contain tributyl phosphate, a toxic organophosphorus compound linked to skin problems ( http://www.rightdiagnosis.com ). But not everyone is convinced that the uniforms are to blame, including Alexander Higgins who recently connected the dots to discover a potential link to the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. After comparing the flight attendants' symptoms to those reported on polar bears and marine life from the northwest U.S. throughout the past year, the timing and correlation of the two is highly suspect. Are Alaska Airlines flight attendants suffering the effects of nuclear radiation fallout? Back in April, AlaskaPublic.org reported that an alarming number of polar bears living in the Beaufort Sea, which is located just north of Alaska and Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories, were turning up with skin lesions and Alopecia, which is another name for hair loss. And before the polar bears, it was apparently ice seals and walruses living in the arctic that were suffering similar symptoms ( http://www.alaskapublic.org ). Upon these discoveries, it seemed as though scientists and biologists tried every which way to avoid tagging nuclear radiation as the cause, blaming viruses, bacteria, and other factors as potential causes . But all of these hypotheses have failed, under further scrutiny, to prove true, which leaves one major elephant in the room that is not being discussed: nuclear fallout from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. Based on the timing of when these creatures began to suffer their horrible symptoms, as well as the nature of their symptoms, it appears as though radiation from Fukushima may at least be one of the causes of this mystery disease. And the striking similarity of the animals' symptoms to those of the Alaska Airlines flight attendants points even more heavily towards a nuclear radiation link in the latter case as well. In any case, there is little or no chance that the mainstream media, the Association of Flight Attendants , or any other prominent group will dare question radiation of Fukushima as a cause. After all, the public has been deliberately left in the dark the whole time about the true severity of Fukushima radiation, which we recently reported has been far worse than what we have all been told in the official story ( http://www.selfnews.com/035847_plume-gate_Fukushima_radiation.html ).

0," Infectious disease medicine and psychiatry have motivated Big Pharma with incentives to provide pills for everything real or imaginary. And only America and New Zealand allow TV advertising with Big Pharma's inventions for often made-up diseases. The made-up diseases or maladies that motivate all these often dangerous, usually ineffective chemical creations range from restless leg syndrome to restless kids. Now, even toddlers are prescribed Ritalin . Now, a new label for a claimed disorder is out -- sleep drunkenness. It's not about going to sleep drunk. It simply describes a state of confusion upon awakening. Hurry, gotta get a pill for that. Never mind that one of Big Pharma's sleeplessness or insomnia remedies has people sleep walking, sleep driving, cooking and eating asleep crazy stuff, or doing whatever, even killing people and not remembering. It's called Ambien, and it's the number one prescribed sleeping pill on the market. What's next, Big Pharma? Maybe something for sleep drunkenness? They even did a study on sleep drunkenness A new study conducted at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California, determined that one in seven Americans suffer from intense confusion upon being awakened. But here's the kicker, 84 percent of them had other sleep disorders, a mental health issue, or were on psychotropic drugs like antidepressants. The study, published August 26, 2014, in the journal Neurology surveyed over 19,000 adults about their sleeping habits to filter out sleep drunkenness episodes and determine their one out of seven number. But although one out of seven did experience at least one episode of 'confusional arousal,' very few appear to have sleep drunkenness as a chronic condition. They just have those other chronic sleep disorders and psychiatric conditions with their psychiatric meds. In other words, almost all of those who experienced sleep drunkenness or 'confusional arousal' had other underlying conditions and/or were on psychiatric pharmaceuticals or used sleeping pills. Bottom line, most 'confusional arousal' episodes are likely iatrogenic (caused by medical treatments). The confusion is rarely severe. But, once, a man walked off the deck of a ship at sea and drowned just after being awakened. It's often not so serious, like bopping a bed mate upon being awakened. After all, during 'confusional arousal,' one doesn't know where one is for a moment. Those few who don't suffer from any of the known sleep disorders -- such as restless leg syndrome , which keeps people awake -- or who don't use psychiatric drugs often have 'confusional arousal' episodes while napping with jet lag or when they have gotten too much or too little sleep. The researchers determined that not enough sleep was usually under six hours and too much sleep was over nine hours. But sleep being interrupted often can create the same confused state of temporarily not knowing where you are as well. Waking up from a wicked nightmare while sweating out a high fever can leave one confused enough to be delirious. Then there's awakening from sleeping off last night's alcohol drunkenness with that fog or memory blank. So, really, what's the big deal about this study and its findings? There are automatic survival instincts at play. Ever suddenly wake up a dog that snaps viciously and then becomes apologetic upon realizing that it snapped at or bit you? It's a very small percentage, 15 percent in this study, who experience sleep drunkenness; even among those who do, it can be very occasional. Some of the 19,136 people surveyed reported only one episode in the last year And 84 percent of that 15 percent were among those who had pre-existing sleep disorders or were using psychiatric pharmaceuticals. Hey, Big Pharma, we don't want any more of your stinking pills. "
0," Water fluoridation may cause hypothyroidism at levels dramatically lower than the maximum level allowed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to a new study conducted by researchers from the University of Kent and published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , a British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) publication. The thyroid gland plays a key role in regulating metabolism and several other bodily systems. Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, can produce serious problems including weight gain and depression. 'Underactive thyroid is a particularly nasty thing to have and it can lead to other long term health problems,' lead author Stephen Peckham said. 'I do think councils need to think again about putting fluoride in the water. There are far safer ways to improve dental health.' Hypothyroidism cases nearly doubled A number of studies have suggested that fluoride ingestion may lead to hypothyroidism. Among other things, research has shown that fluoride inhibits the body's ability to use iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormones. For the new study, the researchers reviewed medical records from the offices of 98 percent of England's general practitioners, which altogether served 95 percent of the country's population between 2012 and 2013. They compared rates of hypothyroidism treated at these practices with data on the fluoride content of water in each of the country's regions. The researchers found that -- after adjusting for other thyroid risk factors -- rates of hypothyroidism were 30 percent higher in medical practices located in areas where the fluoride content of water was between 0.3 parts per million (ppm) and 0.7 ppm, compared with practices in areas with fluoride content below 0.3 ppm. Practices in areas with fluoride content above 0.7 ppm had rates of hypothyroidism 62 percent higher than those from areas with levels below 0.3 ppm. The EPA's threshold for maximum fluoride content of drinking water is 4.0 ppm. The researchers also compared hypothyroidism rates between two large metropolitan areas with similar demographics. One does not have water fluoridation (the greater Manchester area), while one has fluoridation at the standard UK levels of 1.0 ppm (the greater Birmingham area). The analysis showed that rates of hypothyroidism were 94 percent higher in Birmingham area medical practices than in those in the Manchester area. The findings mean that, in England alone, 15,000 people might be suffering from hypothyroidism as a result of water fluoridation, The Telegraph reported. Time to 'rethink' fluoridation Although it has long been suspected that water fluoridation could cause hypothyroidism, the new study is the first to ever look for such an effect in a large population. Indeed, a recent analysis of the health impacts of fluoridation in England, used as evidence to continue pronouncing the practice safe, failed to look at risks of hypothyroidism even though the data for it were available. The researchers called for a 'rethink of public health policy to fluoridate the water supply.' 'Consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure, and public dental health interventions should stop [those] reliant on ingested fluoride and switch to topical fluoride-based and non-fluoride-based interventions,' they said. In the same week that the British study was published, a study was also published in the journal Environmental Health on the risks of water fluoridation. This one found that U.S. states with higher rates of water fluoridation in 1992 had significantly higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2003, 2007 and 2011, after controlling for socioeconomic status. 'Parents reported higher rates of medically-diagnosed ADHD in their children in states in which a greater proportion of people receive fluoridated water from public water supplies,' the researchers wrote. Every 1 percent increase in the prevalence of fluoridation led to between 67,000 to 131,000 extra cases of ADHD.

0," A new study shows that biofuels which are manufactured from leftover materials of harvested corn are worse than gasoline in causing harmful atmospheric emissions in the short term, a finding that challenges the government's assertions that they are a much cleaner alternative to help combat climate change. According to E&E; Publishing, using corn cobs and stover to manufacture cellulose biofuels actually increases emissions from the plant matter and other residue components being burned at biorefineries around the country, rather than being mixed into the soil and remaining trapped as organic soil matter, said researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 'If the residue had not been removed, some of it would be left in the field and be naturally added to maintain soil carbon,' said Adam Liska, lead author of the paper and assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska. The Associated Press further noted: A $500,000 study paid for by the federal government and released [ April 20 ] in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change concludes that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 percent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared with conventional gasoline. While biofuels are better in the long run, the study says they won't meet a standard set in a 2007 energy law to qualify as renewable fuel. Wisconsin, Minnesota carry more carbon losses' Reports said that researchers used a computer model to estimate emissions across the nation's so-called Corn Belt, which consists of about 128 million acres (or about 96.8 million football fields). A removal rate of about 2.68 metric tons per acre per year over five to 10 years may decrease soil organic carbon by some 200 pounds per acre per year. 'This can add an average of 50 to 70 grams of CO2 per megajoule of biofuel. At the high end, this makes these biofuels emit about 7 percent more carbon dioxide than gasoline, making them slightly worse from a climate perspective. Over 10 years, it would reduce gasoline emissions by about 15 percent,' E&E; reported. Researchers said that Wisconsin and Minnesota were found to carry higher carbon losses. They estimate that the cold weather in these states may slow the release of soil organic carbon into the atmosphere. Liska says that the higher corn yields in these states can add larger amounts of carbon to the soil, which then represents a larger loss if corn residue is collected. The AP reported that the study's findings are bad news for what are known as cellulosic biofuels, which have received more than $1 billion in federal subsidies and support but have nevertheless struggled to meet volume targets mandated by law. Some 50 percent of the initial market in cellulosics is estimated to be derived from corn residue. Biofuel industry officials, as well as those within the Obama administration, immediately rebuked the findings and said the research was flawed. Douglas Karlen, a research leader in the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service, said, for example, that the study was too simplistic in its analysis of the loss of carbon from soil, which he says can vary from field to field. Researchers also vastly overestimated how much residue farmers actually remove once the market is up and running. 'I knew this research would be contentious' And, adds Jan Koninckx, the global business director for biorefineries at DuPont: 'The core analysis depicts an extreme scenario that no responsible farmer or business would ever employ because it would ruin both the land and the long-term supply of feedstock. It makes no agronomic or business sense.' Later in the year, DuPont is scheduled to complete construction on a facility estimated to cost in excess of $200 million in Nevada, Iowa, that is expected to produce some 30 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol using corn residue from local farms. A DuPont-financed assessment said the ethanol it will make at the facility could be 100 percent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. 'I knew this research would be contentious,' said Liska. 'I'm amazed it has not come out more solidly until now.' One other aspect of using ethanol-laced fuel instead of 100 percent fossil fuel: The ethanol-laced fuel gets worse mileage per gallon, so more of it must be produced and burned to go the same number of miles.

0," In an article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics , scientists argue that killing newborn babies is ethically no different than abortion and should therefore be openly allowed in society. The paper says newborn babies are not 'actual persons' and that they do not have 'a moral right to life.' (See sources, below.) The authors of the article are mainstream medicine ethicists named Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva. One is a former Oxford scholar. In their paper, they argue 'The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus in the sense that both lack those properties that justify the attribution of a right to life to an individual.' Several death threats have been leveled against the scientists, although it's hard to actually call them 'death' threats since scientists who recognize no sense of life in newborn babies can't possibly be living themselves, right? At best, Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva are mindless zombies , so whacking off their heads with a chainsaw would seemingly be no more meaningful than turning off the switch to a hollow sack of skin that contains no soul. I'm being sarcastic, of course, by using their own mad reasoning against them. They call the murder of infants nothing more than 'after-birth abortion' and declare that 'it should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is.' Can we still abort these scientists? Or is it too late for that? Finally out in the open: The mass murder / eugenics agenda of abortion pushers In one sense, it sure is refreshing to see all this admitted for a change. Instead of hiding behind the false explanations and excuse-making that we normally hear from the abortion crowd, we now get an uncensored, heartless attack on human life wrapped in a 'scientific' paper of such arrogance and destruction that it can only make you wonder just how totally mad the medical scientists have now become. If a human baby has no value to them, then probably neither does a young tree, or a newborn wild animal, or a seed sprout. Life is not sacred to the conventional medical industry; it is merely something to be exploited for power and profit . This is precisely the ethical context under which GMOs are pushed... or chemotherapy, or even vaccines. In fact, the argument of these medical ethicists -- that babies may be murdered because raising them could create an undue burden on society -- is exactly the same logic of the vaccine murderers -- that it's okay if a few children die during a mass vaccination campaign because it reduces the health care burden on society. That's a lie, of course, because vaccines don't actually reduce the spread of infectious disease at all. They increase it, as Jon Rappoport covers in excruciating detail in his new course 'Vaccines: Armed and Dangerous.' ( www.selfnews.com/dangerousvaccines ) In attempting to explain why the Journal of Medical Ethics chose to publish a paper promoting the mass murder of newborn babies , its editor offered the following deplorable self-justification: 'The goal of the Journal of Medical Ethics is not to present the Truth or promote some one moral view. It is to present well reasoned argument based on widely accepted premises.' Well-reasoned? Murdering babies is now 'reasoned?' Using human babies as vaccine guinea pigs If the conventional medical industry sees nothing wrong with murdering newborn babies, no wonder it simultaneously has no problem using them as human guinea pigs on which mad medical experiments are conducted. Over the last hundred years or so, pharmaceutical and vaccine makers have been repeatedly caught using babies as guinea pigs to test the 'safety' of their deadly drugs and vaccines. Such events almost always end up murdering a few dozen children, an outcome which is labeled 'scientific progress' because it provided fatality data to the corporate sponsors of the experiments. Pfizer murdered children Nigeria using precisely such a scheme ( http://www.selfnews.com/033358_Pfizer_dru... ), and the U.S. federal government openly funded 'scientific' drug company experiments on human prisoners in Guatemala ( http://www.selfnews.com/029924_medical_ex... ). In fact, there are literally hundreds of cases of drug companies and governments using innocent children in 'scientific' medical experiments, always claiming that the benefit to society outweighs their murdering ways. These are, of course, the mad murder profiling behaviors of psychotic killers who nevertheless are widely commended and even heralded as world-renowned scientists in the realm of conventional (mainstream) medicine. Yet if anyone on the planet deserves to be justifiably killed by the villagers, it's these mad 'scientific' baby killers and vaccine experiment pushers. As they recognize no value in human life whatsoever, they represent a clear and present danger to the safety of society and might best be dispatched in electric chairs or tightly-bound neck ropes before they unleash another Hitler-era holocaust of eugenics across the globe. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Famed physicist Stephen Hawking also sees no ethical violation in mass murder Lest you think this genocidal streak among the so-called scientific community is limited to just a couple of medical whackos who wrote a paper in a science journal, recall the fact that famed physicist Stephen Hawking openly and adamantly insists human beings are nothing more than 'biological robots' who have no souls, no consciousness, no free will and therefore no value as anything other than a collection of cells. Snuffing out the lights on something that isn't really alive can't exactly be called murder, can it? So the bizarre view that human beings are not conscious beings with minds or souls is, of course, the prerequisite argument to justifying their mass murder. 'It is hard to imagine how free will can operate if our behavior is determined by physical law, so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion.' - Stephen Hawking, the Grand Design If free will is nothing more than an illusion, then that means you aren't responsible for your own actions anyway, so committing mass murder against others is morally neutral for you. Killing babies is of no consequence. Heck, you might as well just pick up a full-auto M4, march into a local high school, and start blasting away all the students, teachers and principal, then claim it must have been your biology that caused you to do it because according to Stephen Hawking, you have no mind or consciousness to begin with. That's the kind of madness the quack philosophies of people like Hawking end up promoting. But it isn't just Hawking who believes humans have no value as conscious, living beings -- DNA discovered Francis Crick also pushed the same stilted beliefs: 'You, your joys and sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules,' , Crick claimed in his book The Astonishing Hypothesis .' This view by Crick, just like the view of Hawking, is that human beings are merely biological machines that only appear to house conscious beings inside. A newborn is just a really advanced fetus, and a fetus is just a couple of cells, they might argue. So a teenage boy playing baseball at the local park is just an advanced version of a newborn, and we can murder him too, if we like. In fact, nobody is off limits from these genocidal maniacs because at no point in human development do psychotic scientific whackos like Hawking or Crick admit that consciousness enters the body, thereby achieving some degree of merit or value as a living, breathing, free-thinking being. These same views are mirrored across the so-called 'scientific' community, which has increasingly revealed itself to be a collection of death merchants, corporate sellouts, clinical quacks and hyper-arrogant God complex worshippers whose deepest dreams always seem to involve destroying humanity. Such is the current aim of none other than Bill Gates, the Microsoft pioneer who now spends his time (and money) preaching the benefits of depopulation. I have no doubt Bill Gates also supports the view that killing babies is no different than aborting them in the womb, but since he hasn't publicly made that statement yet (and probably won't), this will have to remain mere conjecture. We can, however, remain confident in his new nickname, the Sperminator! ( http://counterthink.com/Bill_Gates_is_the_Sp... ) Stop creating mutant babies in the first place Part of the justification of all this in the minds of these baby killers, by the way, is that parents should not have to raise deformed babies, and since many deformities aren't obvious until the moment of birth, parents should have the right to just euthanize the child right after birth, like putting down the family dog. Don't like your first baby? Shoot him and make another, they seem to suggest. That's modern medical ethics for ya, huh? I have a better idea: Why don't we stop causing birth defects in pregnant women in the first place? Have you noticed over the last 2-3 years how aggressively these baby-killing doctors are pushing for mass vaccination of pregnant women? Until about 2009, vaccine shots were never recommended for pregnant women because medical professionals knew the vaccines would cause either birth defects or spontaneous abortions (VERY common in women who are vaccinated while pregnant). Well now, all of a sudden, there are vaccine ads for pregnant women everywhere. The argument now is that pregnant women need MORE vaccines in order to protect themselves and their babies. Hallmark cards even distributes vaccination compliance cards for new moms ( http://www.selfnews.com/034365_Hallmark_v... ) to help make sure newborn babies get injected with an often-fatal cocktail of toxic vaccine chemicals. Do you see the real agenda behind all this? It's yet another depopulation tactic. Vaccinate all the pregnant women and you'll lose maybe another 10% of all the babies through spontaneous abortion. Bill Gates marks that down as a depopulation victory! When do we get to abort all the mad scientists? That there remains a group of mad eugenics 'scientists' in our world who openly and unapologetically promote the mass murder of living newborn babies is itself disturbing enough. But what's really frustrating is that the rest of us can't just take a machete to these people because we are bound by a higher sense of honoring the value of life -- even the lives of those who are destroyers of life. Because after all, if the argument is that we can openly kill people as long as such murders benefit society, then there's a really, really long list of people who need to be taken out, starting with many of the top death-merchant scientists who push all this madness. (But we don't do that kind of thing, because we're decent people, see?) If we kill them at age 55, it's not really murder, remember. It's just a really drawn-out post-partum abortion, they say. In fact, according to these science psychos, you can kill anybody right up to the day they die and still call it an abortion. It's all just a matter of time, and time is an illusion, the physicists claim. So get out your chainsaws, ninja swords and poison blowgun darts, friends. Saddle up and lock-and-load. There's some death to deal out on this here planet, and thanks to the likes of authors who are published in mainstream scientific journals, it's now a total free-for-all death derby on the human race! If you kill enough people, you might even win a free subscription to the Journal of Medical Ethics ! Editor's note: Please don't actually kill anyone after reading this article. Some of the language used herein is presented in a tongue-in-cheek style of indignant sarcasm in order to draw attention to the outrageous absurdity of the medical ethicists being covered here. We do not condone actually killing anyone. Not even those who very clearly deserve it.

0," As controversial as it may sound, botox has now been approved for the treatment of migraines by no less than the US' Food and Drug Administration and the Medicines and Health Care products Regulatory agency of the UK. In a study featured in the journal Cephalalgia , it was discovered that those who availed of botox as a treatment for migraines enjoyed a ten percent reduction in the number of headache days when compared with the placebo group. This finding does not appear to have convinced experts on the efficacy of such procedure. Jen Olesen, Chief of the Danish Headache Centre , Glostrup University Hospital in Denmark, criticizes the findings and identified faults in the trial. He has expressed his concerns to the Lancet which was contained in an editorial of the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin . Olesen is of the opinion that the FDA made a mistake in approving the botox treatment for migraine. According to him, half of the trial participants overused pain medications, preventing the researchers from telling whether the participants had chronic migraine or headache caused by medication overuse. Moreover, it's impossible to hide participants receiving botox treatments, invalidating the double blind nature of the experiment, as their facial expression change. Can Botox genuinely do the job? Botox is a popular drug used for anti-aging treatments. How it came to be considered as a remedy for migraine started ten years ago when some plastic surgeons from Hollywood noticed that their patients felt some relief from migraines after undergoing botox treatment. The idea spread and became an 'off-label-treatment' to other practitioners. The pharmaceutical company that developed botox soon found out and started marketing it as a remedy for migraine. The company was subsequently fined for $375 million for unlawful marketing since at that time, there was no proof that botox could indeed treat migraines . Nevertheless, it appears that some studies are beginning to crop up supporting botox as a possible treatment for migraines. According to a recent article featured in the Journal of the American Medical Association , a review and analysis of previous studies on botox injections as a remedy for migraine only reveals a 'small to modest benefit for patients suffering chronic migraine headaches and chronic daily headaches.' Headache vs. migraine? Migraines and tension type headaches are common, and at some point in their life, at least 42 percent of adults experience a tension type headache. Most, however, do not seek professional help, just preferring to take an aspirin and hope that it goes away. Less common, migraines are associated with greater disability affecting around 8 to 18 percent of people worldwide. A headache normally starts with a feeling of gradual pressure or tightness in the head and then increases into a feeling of a tremendous amount of pressure. A common feature of headaches is that they is felt on both sides of the head.Migraines, on the other hand, are normally felt on one side of the head. Fatigue or lack of sleep, emotional stress and depression have all been identified to be leading causes of headaches. Certain foods have also been identified to have a potentially contributing factor. Dealing with the headache For many people, the onset of a headache means downing a pill. Contrary to popular belief, however, the answer is not always drugs: Drugs only build up dependency and do not in any way address the real source of the matter. Below are some options to dealing with those pesky headaches: Visit a chiropractor - In a study published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics , 218 study subjects suffering from headache who were given either chiropractic care or drug therapy or both experienced a 40 to 50 percent reduction in pain. However, four weeks after all care ended, those who had chiropractic care still enjoyed the benefit of their relief as opposed to those who received drug therapy who experienced only a 50 percent reduction in their improvement. In a study conducted by Duke University comparing drug therapy using amitriptyline with that of chiropractic care, both treatments had similar short term effects on tension headache pain. Amitriptyline, however, caused adverse reactions in 82 percent of the study subjects. The best part of this study occurred when all care was discontinued, patients who had received drug therapy returned to the state they had prior to the research study, but those who received chiropractic care continued to benefit from reduction in headache frequency and severity. Acupuncture - This is an ancient Chinese healing method that stimulates specific points in the body using thin metallic needles. The British Journal of Medicine published a study which involved 400 adult subjects who experienced regular headaches or migraines. They were divided into groups: one received only standard conventional care while the other group received 12 acupuncture sessions for a three month period. At the conclusion of the said study, it was revealed that compared to those who were on conventional care, participants who received acupuncture sessions experienced more or less fewer overall headaches and used less medication. This group also reported taking only a few sick days off from work. Try herbal remedies - History has shown how herbs have been used for food and medicine. Using herbs instead of downing a common prescription drug for pain has its advantages since herbs do not normally have the unwanted side effects of prescription drugs. Moreover, their continued use over the centuries has proven its safety for human consumption. Nevertheless, even though herbs have no or little undesirable side effects, they can cause some undesirable reactions in some persons. It is recommended, therefore, to try one herb at a time beginning with small doses and watching out for side effects. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, ginger is highly recommended for dealing with headaches: you can either eat it fresh or enjoy it as tea. You can also enjoy herbal teas like chamomile, peppermint or rosehip to deal with a tension headache. In India, betel leaf is used to relieve intense headaches. Containing analgesic and cooling properties, it can be applied over the affected area with beneficial results. A few drops of Lavender essential oils can be used to massage the temple, relaxing the muscles and relieving pain. Try changing your diet - Avoid products that contain aspartame and MSG . These products have been known to trigger headaches, and 75 percent of reported adverse reactions to food additives are attributed to aspartame. Food additives like nitrates and nitrites found in processed food dilate blood vessels triggering headaches in some people sensitive to it. Try a massage - In a recent study published in the online journal Annals of Behavioral Medicine , it was revealed that massage therapy could be a nonpharmacologic treatment for migraine. In the said study, migraine sufferers were randomly assigned to massage or control conditions. The study concluded revealing massage participants exhibiting exceptional improvements in the frequency of migraine attacks as well as quality of sleep during the period of intervention and the follow-up which was conducted three weeks later. Moreover, an observation regarding a trend on the beneficial effects of massage was found. This was especially true as regards the individual participant's perceived stress and coping efficacy. During sessions, massage produced a decrease in state anxiety, heart rate and cortisol. Exercise - According to an article on selfnews.com, people who don't exercise are 14 percent more likely to experience headaches. A recent study in Sweden investigated the connection between exercise and its effects on headache. It involved 26 participants taking part in a 40 minute cycling exercise program conducted indoors, thrice a week for twelve weeks. The researchers monitored each participant's use of oxygen to measure the fitness level. The participants, for their part, recorded their migraine attacks during the said study. They also noted the days in which the migraines occurred, how intense they were and how much medication was used. At the conclusion of the study, participants were reporting less migraine attacks occurring less often and with less intensity. It was observed that maximum oxygen uptake noticeable increased. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Can we prevent migraines from happening? They say that prevention is better than cure, but does it apply to migraines as well? Research has revealed that migraines occur for a reason and are normally caused by triggers. These are factors, whether external or internal, that set a migraine in motion. Weather, food, changes in the daily schedule or hormonal changes have been identified as some of the triggers that could cause a migraine. For those who suffer from migraines, keeping a diary of migraine attacks could be an effective way of identifying your trigger. According to relieve-migraine-headache.com, the key to finding your trigger is taking stock of your activities 1-2 days before a migraine attack and finding out what's in common. It can be along process, but it is worth the effort. Identifying what can trigger a migraine is the best way of keeping it from affecting your quality of life. "
0," Having bad skin is something that millions of people deal with every single day, and for the most part, it's a very preventable condition. From adolescent breakouts to adult acne, there are varying degrees of having 'bad skin,' and most of the cases have to do with bad decisions. More recently, science has been able to shed light on possible catalysts for these conditions, and the data discovered has opened the eyes of many. From food choices and overall gut function to body product selection, the list is quite extensive. The diet and skin connection This is by far one of the most influential factors in relation to dealing with skin issues. Grains, sugar and processed foods have been repeatedly tied to acne and other skin conditions such as eczema. By now, there is no denying that one's diet has a direct correlation to the quality of his or her skin. By eliminating sugars, refined grains (gluten) and processed, preserved foods from the diet, an individual can have much success in the fight against bad skin - it has been scientifically proven. Yet, out of the many foods that can contribute to this problem, sugar has got to be the worst of them all. For those who don't already know, sugar leads to elevated insulin levels, which in turn can lead to the production of acne-producing bacteria. This is an overlooked area of dermatology within the modern medical system. Toxic cosmetics In the world of so-called 'beauty products,' people have become quite gullible and fall for a lot of scams - this is no surprise by now. What's important to realize is that chemically dense cosmetic products do not promote beauty or healthy skin - they just seem like they do. From lotions to various types of make up, most of these products are toxic and can cause serious skin (and health) problems for the consumer. The key is to make sure all skin and body products are of high quality with natural ingredients. Coconut oil as a daily lotion is a perfect example of something that is great to use instead of an item that is loaded with chemicals. Select pure, more natural skin products, and healthy skin will follow. Detoxifying your life The Western way of living is very toxic, and conditions such as acne are primarily disorders that plague those within the modernized world. By taking a more natural and organic path in life (foods and body products ), these types of conditions can be dealt with more efficiently. It makes sense that the body shows signs of disease when it's constantly being filled with junk. Acne is one of the many signs that the body is not at ease with itself. For more information on ways to effectively prevent acne, make sure to look at the resource section below. "
0," Americans and the Chinese people have another thing in common besides a big economy vaccine violence. As reported by the BBC, parents in China are extremely angry after learning about a massive illegal vaccine operation in Shangdong province. The illegal ring involved hundreds of people and had spread to 24 provinces and cities, according to local media cited by the BBC. The outrage grew after news spread that a boy who had been vaccinated died, though Chinese officials claimed the death was not tied to the Shangdong scandal, a story that no thinking person would actually believe. The illegal vaccine ring one of a plethora of health and safety scandals in China in recent years was likely in operation since 2011, officials said. The ringleaders, said to be a mother and daughter who bought the vaccines from licensed and unlicensed sources, have been arrested, according to reports. After buying the vaccines, the pair would then sell them to illegal agents or local disease control and prevention centers for inflated prices, the BBC reported, citing the Xinhua news agency. Officials have known for a year It turns out that the 88 million dollars' worth of vaccines purchased and sold were also not properly refrigerated or transported in state-approved conditions. Xinhua notes that because the vaccines were potentially compromised there could be more deaths and disabilities. Chinese authorities have been investigation the illegal ring for a year, reports said, but only made it public in recent days after issuing a call demanding that suppliers come forward so they can trace potential victims. Chinese social media exploded with questions as to why it took the government so long to acknowledge the ring. 'This is such a huge case and not a single regulatory official has come out to apologise, not a single one has resigned... this system which doesn't care whether ordinary citizens live or die makes one's soul tired,' said one user. '24 provinces, 5 years already, and how many children!... It's been nearly a year and then they reveal this! Isn't this genocide? Words cannot express how angry I am!' another wrote. Authorities responded to the public outcry by promising to punish everyone responsible, but that wasn't likely to quell the anger anytime soon. 'They also released details on the affected vaccines , which included those for polio, rabies, mumps, encephalitis, hepatitis B and meningococcal diseases,' the BBC reported further, adding that the four-year-old boy who died passed away after receiving meningococcal and polio vaccines. More vaccine injury coming to America As mentioned earlier, China now shares the tragedy of vaccine injury with the United States. As selfnews reported in September 2013 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 'abruptly deleted a fact page on their website linking cancer with simian virus 40 (SV40) found in polio vaccines. Disturbingly, it's estimated that well over 98 million Americans are now infected with this cancer promoting virus - and the numbers are likely growing.' The excised page contained additional information, such as: SV40 virus has been found in certain types of cancer in humans, but it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers. Sayer Ji, founder of GreenMedInfo , disagrees. 'SV-40 has a well-known mechanism of carcinogenicity. This virus suppresses the transcriptional properties of the tumor-suppressing p53 protein in humans, a gene product that has been described as 'the guardian of the genome' because of its critical role in preventing genome instability and cancer initiation,' he said. 'When p53 is disabled, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cell cycle arrest is rendered dysfunctional, leading to uncontrolled (immortalized) cell proliferation, and tumor formation.' What's more, it's likely that recent efforts to force parents to vaccinate all children could soon be directed at adults, as well. Read that story at Vaccines.news .

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) New Dutch research suggests that low levels of man-made chemicals in common foods such as bread, milk and butter could build up in the human body and cause harm. Dutch research cited by WWF-UK (World Wildlife Fund) indicates that low levels of chemicals from the environment or food packaging can be present in foods in low levels. Some scientists believe that even low levels of such chemicals can accumulate in the body and cause health problems. The Dutch scientists found low levels of flame retardants, pesticides, artificial fragrances, non-stick chemicals and phthalate chemicals from plastics in foods. Research conducted at the London School of Pharmacy suggests that even low doses of such chemicals can combine over time to produce serious medical conditions. Natural health advocate Mike Adams, author of 'Grocery Warning,' says certain chemicals used in food packaging have already started causing problems for humans and the environment. For example, fish throughout the Potomac River have been discovered in large numbers with both male and female sex organs, and Adams points out that human girls are now showing signs of puberty as young as 3 years old. Hormone-related cancers have skyrocketed in recent years, Adams says, largely because hormones in animals and humans have begun mimicking chemicals -- especially those that come from plastics. Health authorities in the UK have said consumers and manufacturers should not be complacent about chemicals in their foods, but that further research is needed to determine how certain substances react with one another, as well as the products of those reactions. ### "

0," Tweet Eli Lilly treated the American public 'like guinea pigs' says Harvard psychiatrist Martin Teicher. He goes on to explain how Eli Lilly was engaged in widespread scientific fraud in the cherry picking of individuals for drug trial results. Basically, if anyone in the drug trial began to show suicidal behavior, they were 'excused' from the trial and removed from the outcome data. None of this is any surprise to readers of this website, of course. I went public with accusations about the suicide risk of of antidepressant drugs in 1999. At that time it was widely ridiculed and called a 'conspiracy theory.' Now, once again, it is emerging as scientific fact. There are so many murder/suicides linked to Prozac and other SSRI drugs that the public would be absolutely shocked to learn the true details of how many people have been killed by these drugs. Remember Phil Hartman, the comedian? He was killed by his wife who was also on these drugs. And let's not forget the Colombine massacre, in which both teenage boys who blew away their classmates were on antidepressants. What amazes me the most about all this is how drug companies manage to cover up these facts and suppress negative evidence for so long. After all, these missing Prozac documents are from a trial in 1994! That's a good ten years of suppression during which billions of dollars worth of these drugs have been peddled to patients by drug-pushing doctors. Of course, Eli Lilly denies everything. All their drugs are perfectly safe, they have nothing to hide, and their only mission is to serve the good of mankind... to hear it from them, anyway. I wonder how the parents of the Colombine children feel about all this? "
0," Parents who exercise a vaccine exemption for their children are often ridiculed for putting their own children and others at risk. However, legally and medically, unvaccinated children do not pose a significant health risk to themselves or anyone else. Alternative vaccine views support this assertion, but the reasoning in this article comes straight from mainstream vaccine beliefs, accepted medical practice and current law.[1] First, from the legal perspective, forty-eight state legislatures, federal agencies (e.g., Department of Defense, U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services), and all U.S. territories offer religious exemptions to immunizations. The state legislatures and federal agencies providing these exemptions are presumed to have considered whether or not the exercise of these exemptions would pose a significant health risk. They would not have enacted these exemption laws if their exercise would pose a significant health risk. Thus, there is a legal presumption that the exercise of a vaccine exemption does not pose a significant risk to anyone. This legal presumption is not a mere exercise in semantics or logic. It is based on the widely accepted herd immunity theory, which tells us that so long as most of the members of a population are immune, all members of the population are protected. Indeed, current vaccine policy necessarily depends on this scientific theory. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tells us: 'No vaccine is 100% effective. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. For reasons related to the individual, some will not develop immunity.'[2] (Note that they blame the 'individual', and not the vaccines. Regardless, the CDC says this is why the majority of outbreaks occur in vaccinated children .) In contrast, national exemption rates run about 1% - 2.5% on average.[3] But we needn't be concerned about either, since 100% immunity is not required for all to be protected. Furthermore, just as vaccinated children are not necessarily immune, exempt children aren't necessarily lacking immunity. Many exempt children develop natural immunity, and according to the CDC, they don't have to get sick for that to happen.[4] The bottom line is, you can't determine the immunity status of any given individual child by the child's vaccination status alone. But with the herd immunity theory, we don't need to; we need only be concerned with a populations' vaccination status collectively. Not only do non-immune children (vaccinated or not) not pose a significant health risk now, they pose no significant future risk, as protective laws and procedures have been put into place to account for them. For example, most states require exempt children to stay home from school during a local outbreak, for the duration of the incubation period of the outbreak disease. (Curiously, this practice discriminates against exempt children, since their non-immune, vaccinated peers, who far outnumber them, should be considered the greater threat, if lack of immunity is the real concern. But non-immune, vaccinated children are not required to stay home, presumably because of the inconvenience of identifying them.) Most states also have laws that can require vaccination and/or quarantine of exempt persons in a declared, infectious disease emergency. So, neither exempt children nor their non-immune, vaccinated peers pose a significant health risk -- now, or at any time in the future. A related issue is school administrators who fear that they risk liability if they allow exemptions. The short answer is that parents exercising a lawful exemption right do not place themselves or anyone else at risk of liability. By definition, liability occurs only when a law is breached. If all concerned are complying with the law, there won't be a liability risk. Again, there is a legal presumption; here, that the proper exercise of a legal exemption does not create a significant liability risk -- or else the exemption law would not have been enacted in the first place. Myths about vaccines and infectious disease persist, despite voluminous information refuting them, for the simple reason that fear is more powerful than reason. As the above reveals, this is true even within the world of vaccine mainstream beliefs. One of the more common mistakes comes from trying to apply concepts to individuals that really only apply to groups. Since exempt children may be immune and vaccinated children may lack immunity, we can't assume that any given individual does or doesn't pose a risk without further investigation. But again, we don't need to; if a group is immune, each individual is protected. If you factor in the use of other more effective means of addressing infectious disease concerns, the level of concern diminishes even more.[5] Those uncomfortable with the above have recourse with the state legislatures and promulgating regulatory agencies; that is, they can pursue changes in the law. Absent such changes, the exercise of a vaccine exemption is, necessarily, a reasonably safe option that poses no significant health risk to anyone, legally or medically.

0," No matter what junk science the global corporations are trying to push, there's always a long list of scientists, doctors and journalists ready to accept some payola money to spread their propaganda. The latest example comes from the Coca-Cola company, which paid 'fitness and nutrition experts' to place pro-Coke articles in over 1,000 news websites (including major newspapers) to position Coca-Cola as a 'healthy snack.' Yep. Guzzling a can full of high fructose corn syrup, phosphoric acid and chemical flavorings is being pawned off as 'healthy' in America's corporate-run media circus. Like most corporate lies, this is all being done under the banner of 'SCIENCE!' As Coca-Cola explains, this effort is merely designed '...to help bring context to the latest facts and science around our products and ingredients,' says Coca-Cola. (Source = AP story link below.) Yep, if you think drinking Coca-Cola with all its genetically modified high fructose corn syrup isn't incredibly healthy, then you're 'anti-science' because you're opposed to the twisted quack science the corporations are pushing through payola schemes that place their propaganda on willing mainstream media websites. Associated Press exposes ethics violations of corporate payola schemes To her credit, Associated Press writer Candice Choi wrote a very informative article on this , exposing ethics violations that are abundantly obvious in such 'payola journalism' deals. Now, it's one thing to ethically promote truly healthful solutions that benefit readers. After all, I sometimes announce new superfood products here on selfnews, fully disclosing why these products are cleaner (heavy metals lab testing, for example) and explaining that they are available at the selfnews Store. That's honest news about a new solution that benefits people. But to accept money to promote something that causes diabetes, obesity and kidney stones is another matter entirely. Coca-Cola soft drinks directly contribute to serious chronic diseases that destroy lives and cause enormous suffering. Accepting money to push Coke as a 'healthy snack' is not just highly unethical, it's also a blatant sellout to corporations whose products contribute to disease. Shameless writers plug Coke for money And look who's doing it, too: A registered dietician in a Chicago bilingual newspaper wrote this Coca-Cola propaganda piece entitled, 'Ideas to Score a Touchdown during the Super Bowl without Sacrificing the Diet.' The article suggests that Hispanics -- who already suffer horrendous rates of type-2 diabetes -- should 'drink a mini Coke can with mini sliders.' The writer, not surprisingly, is a paid propagandist who also produces corporate communications for Kellogg's and other companies. Similarly, this piece on Patch.com promises 'Heart Health Month Snacking & Exercise Tips.' What it actually offers is lines like '...look for a refreshing beverage option such as a mini can of Coca-Cola.' The author is described as '...a Personal Trainer and Sports Nutritionist who helps individuals, businesses including The Coca-Cola Company and organizations develop a culture of wellness...' Seriously? Coca-Cola can be mentioned in the same sentence as 'a culture of wellness?' Why not just sign up to get paid by Big Tobacco to promote 'cigarette wellness programs that help people 'balance' the nicotine in their lives'? For the record, a mini-Coke '...is 7.5 ounces and has 90 calories, all of it from high-fructose corn syrup,' reports the AP. It also contains phosphoric acid. The HFCS comes from genetically engineered corn. There is nothing whatsoever about this product that even approaches the concept of 'wellness.' Code words for corporate shills and propaganda hacks: These 'opinions are my own' Whether you're dealing with biotech corporate shills (paid professional 'science liars'), fluoride poison pushers or Coca-Cola propagandists, a key phrase that helps identify these sleight-of-mouth word twisters is 'these opinions are my own.' I remember reading an email written by Jon Entine, the discredited GMO propagandist who Forbes.com recently cut off from publishing fabricated articles on the Forbes website. In an email, he aggressively insisted 'the opinions are my own,' claiming he had no direct ties to biotech companies. Yeah, sure he doesn't. And all these people writing about Coca-Cola would '...be recommending Coke anyway,' they insist. Seriously. As the AP story reports: The health experts who wrote the pieces mentioning Coke stand by their recommendations. Robyn Flipse, the dietitian who wrote the sponsored article for Coke, said she would suggest mini-cans of Coke even if she wasn't being paid. ROFL.

Coca-Cola admits running a network of paid corporate propagandists Coca-Cola's payola scheme is far bigger than just a few sellout bloggers and writers who plug Coke for money. 'We have a network of dietitians we work with,' Coca-Cola spokesperson Ben Sheidler told the Associated Press. And how does Ben defend the practice? 'Every big brand works with bloggers or has paid talent.' Wow. It's okay because all the other corporations are doing it too, apparently. 'Paid talent,' of course, refers to writers, bloggers, scientists and journalists who take money to spread corporate propaganda . There are hoards of 'em. You'd be shocked to learn just how many stories that appear in the media contain plugs for toxic corporate products, covertly placed inside articles to make them appear like they aren't blatant ads. These corporate-paid propaganda pieces are run on thousands of mainstream news sites across the world, it turns out. As the Associated Press story reveals: One column is marked at the bottom as a 'sponsored article,' which is an ad designed to look like a regular story. It ran on more than 1,000 sites, including those of major news outlets around the country. The other posts were not marked as sponsored content, but follow a similar format. 'Major news outlets' , in other words, are secretly running corporate advertisements disguised as news. It makes me wonder: how many news organizations took money from Big Pharma to censor the truth about the CDC's vaccine science fraud whistleblower? How many got paid to falsely claim all vaccines are safe and effective? How much money does the biotech industry spend to buy fabricated articles in the mainstream media or pay off 'scientists' to claim the GMO science is 'settled'? The even bigger story here is one you may not have thought of: How many so-called 'alternative' websites took grant money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and then suddenly started promoting GMOs and vaccines? Look around... there are far more of these than you might realize. Almost every pro-corporate message in the media is a PAID placement Finally, when you look at the so-called 'news' on the web these days, keep your Spidey sense on high alert. Almost every pro-corporation message is a paid content piece... either directly paid as payola or indirectly paid through advertising that funds the site. Notice that selfnews accepts no advertising from drug companies, big food companies and the biotech industry. If Bill & Melinda Gates sent me a check for $10 million to 'invest' in selfnews, I would reject it and send it back . Real journalism can never be honestly pursued by any news organization that is wholly compromised by corporate money. The only truly honest news you'll get comes from small, independent operations run by real people who have a strong internal code of ethics that rejects corporate sellouts and financial infiltration.

0," An amazing breakthrough has taken place on the cancer research front, with a possible cure coming from a popular Chinese herb. Researchers out of the U.S., publishing their work in the peer-reviewed journal Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology , found that triptolide, an extract from the Chinese herb 'thunder god vine' ( Tirpterygium wilforii ), helps regulate the expression of a key protein involved in cancer cell death, effectively targeting pancreatic cancer cells for elimination using the body's own resources. The fourth leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., pancreatic cancer is basically a death sentence within the conventional model of treatment. Five percent or less of patients diagnosed with it survive more than five years after undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, according to the data, making it one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer that humans, and men in particular, currently face. But researchers from the University of Minnesota , through a grant provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), have made an incredible discovery with regards to the T. wilforii herb that could change the way cancer is treated. After administering triptolide onto human pancreatic cancer cells and tissue in a culture, the research team noticed that the extract decreased expression of a protein known as GRP78 that protects cells against death, including pancreatic cancer cells. GRP78 can protect cancer cells The normal role of GRP78 is to both produce and aid in the correct folding of proteins, a necessary function that ensures proper cell function. GRP78 is also responsible for transferring proteins, as well as carbohydrates, to other areas including the Golgi apparatus (a type of cell organelle), the plasma membrane, and cell lysosomes. When something interferes with this normal protein production and transfer process, GRP78 activates another cellular process known as 'unfolded protein response,' or UPR, that prevents ER stress from damaging and killing healthy cells. In other words, GRP78 acts as a regulator to ensure that cells are both fed and protected. But during this process, GRP78 can also inadvertently protect cancer cells against apoptosis as well, promoting their survival and spread throughout the body. It is this action of aiding and abetting the enemy, so to speak, that appears to be disengaged when triptolide is introduced into the picture, suggesting that administration of this herbal remedy to humans could effectively induce a cancer-protective effect. 'GRP78, a protein that protects cells from dying, is more abundant in cancer cells and tissue than in normal organs and is thought to play a role in helping pancreatic cancer cells survive and thrive,' reads an announcement by the American Physiological Society (APS), the group that published the study. Triptolide helps calibrate GRP78 to promote cancer cell death Because GRP78 does not always differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells in its preservation mechanism, it can actually promote the proliferation of cancer cells at the expense of healthy ones. But triptolide helps to remedy this by adjusting the function of UPR, provisioning it to trigger cell death in cancerous cells while preserving healthy ones. 'Our study shows that although increased expression of GRP78 confers a survival advantage to the tumor cells, prolonged exposure to triptolide induces chronic ER stress, which eventually leads to cell death,' wrote the authors. 'In this context, inhibition of GRP78 by activation of the ER stress pathway by triptolide offers a novel mechanism for inhibiting the growth and survival of pancreatic cancer cells.'

0," While type 1 diabetes is not as common as type 2 diabetes, it can be just as devastating. Unlike type 2, which is largely caused by weight gain, poor nutrition, lack of exercise and other controllable risk factors, type 1 diabetes is considered to be an autoimmune disorder and a person is born with it. The beta cells in the pancreas of a type 1 diabetic are not able to manufacture the insulin to control blood sugars in the body. As a result, blood sugars can get dangerously high or low - and quickly. Traditionally, type 1 diabetes is controlled with a combination of insulin injections or an insulin pump as well as careful counting of carbohydrates in regards to activity levels. However, this can be an extremely difficult way to live, especially for children. There, are, however, natural substances which have the potential to treat this condition. Read on to find out more. Arginine Arginine is an amino acid and is available in most health food stores as a nutritional supplement. In a 2007 study, it was found that regular use of arginine in laboratory animals was able to stimulate the pancreas to produce beta cells, the special kind of pancreatic cells which produce insulin. Goldenseal Goldenseal is an herb with a long history of medicinal use both in the East and the West. Modern science believes that part of its value as a treatment lies in the fact that it contains berberine, a bioactive compound. Berberine has been shown in studies on laboratory animals to, like arginine, stimulate the production of the pancreatic beta cells which the body needs to make insulin. Stevia This naturally sweet plant - now widely popular as a sugar substitute - is a good choice for diabetics for other reasons other than avoiding a lot of simple carbohydrates. It contains compounds which have been shown to rejuvenate pancreatic beta cells that have been damaged. Its actions are similar to an anti-diabetic drug called glibenclamide but without unwanted side effects. Red clover Red clover is traditionally thought of as a woman's herb because of its hormone-balancing properties, but it is great for type 1 diabetics as well. This is due to one of its active compounds, a substance called genistein which has been proven to help stimulate beta cell proliferation in the pancreas. Fig leaves Fig leaves contain compounds which have currently not be isolated but which are believed to have an anti-diabetic effect. Diabetics who take supplements made from fig leaves do not need as much insulin as those who don't. The substances discussed above offer hope for a treatment for type 1 diabetes that is natural and does not rely on synthetic insulin whether from injections or a pump. And these natural treatments could make a huge difference to young type 1 diabetics and allow them to have the kind of normal childhood which is difficult or impossible to have with current mainstream treatments.

0," As the November elections draw nearer and Obamacare continues to ravage American families -- even as President Obama scrambles to try to delay the most controversial portions of the law -- more and more people are speaking out against it, and not because they oppose it politically, per se, but because of its disastrous effects on their lives. As a result, the administration propaganda machine has been unleashed against many of the most vocal critics, which conjures up images of Stalin's authoritarianism or Hitler's Joseph Goebbels. Especially hard-hit by Obamacare's requirements and mandates are some of the most vulnerable of citizens -- cancer victims who have seen their treatment and care permanently disrupted. National Review provides the set-up for this story: Michigan is a crucial piece on the 2014 U.S. Senate chessboard, and Republicans have a good shot at gaining retiring Democrat Carl Levin's open seat, given Democratic nominee Gary Peters's unpopular House vote for the Affordable Care Act. Yet Peters has hope. The president's unilateral delays in Obamacare mandates have eased planned layoffs by local governments and businesses. Moderate GOP governor Rick Snyder supports the ACA's Medicaid expansion. And the state's liberal news media have largely ignored the estimated 225,000-plus canceled individual policies and the job losses at medical-device maker Stryker. But Julie Boonstra won't be ignored. So she must be destroyed. 'This law will kill me' Boonstra, of Dexter, Mich., is a leukemia victim; last fall, she lost her coverage because -- like those millions of other Americans -- her plan did not comply with Obamacare minimum coverage requirements. To comply with the law, her insurance company, like many others, had no choice but to drop her, lest they be in violation of the law by offering a plan that did not meet federal mandates. Boonstra, however, declined to take the loss lying down. In what is being described as a 'devastating' ad, the schoolteacher took her story public, skewering Obamacare and Democratic Rep. Gary Peters' House vote supporting Obamacare. (Note: This is not a selfnews endorsement of chemical cancer treatment; this is merely to demonstrate that an American citizen's right to choose her own treatment has been denied by men and women in government and Congress who have passed a law that does not impact or affect them one iota.) For her efforts, Boonstra has since been targeted by some of the very same Democrats who voted for the Affordable Care Act and their allies in the mainstream media. They have tainted her reputation and dubbed her as a liar and an idiot because she wouldn't simply embrace her new government-approved Obamacare plan. The strategy is the same for all other outspoken female Obamacare cancer victims from other states: massive intimidation meant to silence them or keep them from coming forward in the first place, National Review reported. Perhaps no one has been more callous in this regard than Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.; he has claimed -- on the Senate floor, no less -- that 'all of' the Obamacare 'horror stories' being told 'are untrue.' This is the same Reid who, during last fall's government shutdown, refused to agree to legislation that would fund cancer treatment for children . And the compliant Obama media piles on It's all part of a horribly heartless campaign to get Peters elected to retiring Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin's seat. 'If I do not receive my medication, I will die,' Boonstra, who was invited to the State of the Union address as the guest of Representative Tim Walberg, R-Mich., frets in the ad. 'I believed the president. I believed I could keep my health insurance plan. I feel lied to. ... Congressman Peters, your decision to vote for Obamacare jeopardized my health.' The media in Michigan and Washington piled on: -- The Washington Post 's 'Fact Checker' Glenn Kessler knocked Boonstra for not embracing a cheaper a lower-premium, higher-out-of-pocket-cost Blue Cross plan that Democrats (who aren't paying the bills) insist is more affordable. -- In Michigan, The Detroit Free Press boosted Kessler's claim that Boonstra's statements rated 'two Pinocchios.' -- 'A Dexter woman's claims in a political ad criticizing U.S. Rep. Gary Peters don't add up,' said MLive.com (a consortium of Booth newspapers in the state), which then faulted Boonstra's math skills.

0," Corn (also known as maize), was already being eaten 8,700 years ago in the lowlands of what is now southwestern Mexico. Like all domestic crops, it was probably developed through a combination of random mutations (producing, for example, a variety whose seed heads did not explode, thus allowing the seeds to be harvested by humans) and selective breeding by humans. Selective breeding occurs when humans facilitate the reproduction of only those plant or animal varieties that contain the traits most beneficial for themselves. Just how long it took humans to domesticate wheat, corn, or any other crop is a matter of fierce scientific debate. For example, while domestic wheat was already being eaten 9,000 years ago in what is now southeastern Turkey, archaeological evidence suggests that humans may have been eating the grain's wild ancestor 14,000 years before that. How much of the intervening time period involved selective breeding, whether passively or deliberately, may never be known with any degree of certainty. Selective breeding is a truly natural way to shape the properties of an agricultural crop, whereas genetic engineering is an unnatural method that violates nature by creating GMO -- a source of 'genetic pollution' that now threatens the future of all food crops on our planet.

0," It is my privilege to welcome to Mental Health Exposed this week none other than Dr. Eric Pearl, developer of Reconnective Healing , author of The Reconnection and the new book, Solomon Speaks . I am not a Reconnection follower, although I do have some appreciation for what Dr. Pearl has accomplished since he burst onto the spiritual and energy healing scene. Reconnective Healing is a new, non-touch approach to energy healing. When you are trained and reconnected, you gain access to spiritual energy in the universe that you can pass to others and heal them of all kinds of ills. All of this began after Dr. Pearl was contacted by spiritual entities that were channeled through unsuspecting patients in his Los Angeles chiropractic office. When I heard he was interested in being my guest on Mental Health Exposed, I agreed on the condition that I am a skeptic and would be more interested in challenging Dr. Pearl than catering to him. The challenge was accepted. On the July 3, 2013 episode of Mental Health Exposed, Dr. Pearl and I went at it. I did challenge him. I questioned his methods. I suggested that his students are victims of mass hypnosis. I took issue with him on the practice of channeling, a theme central to Solomon Speaks. Dr. Pearl was ready. I was told he could hold his own in any environment and he certainly did that. He is a very, very intelligent man with an in depth knowledge of healing, communication skills and spirituality. When you factor in his charisma, it puts Dr. Pearl over the top and into a rare class of people who are able to create new paradigms and attract millions of followers. Whenever this happens, those of us on the outside of the phenomenon are left to wonder what the hell is going on. Could all this be true? Or is it all one bold, fantastic lie? Dr. Pearl's story reminds me of Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith. Joseph's claims of having seen God, angels, gold plates and so forth were so far out there that some people believed him because 'no one could make all that up.' I feel the same way about Dr. Pearl. If he is making up his story - and you simply have to listen to it to understand it - it rivals Joseph Smith. If he is making all that up, then he is either a sociopathic liar, charlatan scum or crazy. If Dr. Pearl is telling the truth, then Reconnective Healing is something that you definitely NEED to understand because it is changing the world and the way people heal . We are truly at the dawn of a new spiritual and energetic age that appears to be ushered in by Dr. Pearl. Dr. Pearl's response? 'I'm just a guy from New Jersey. I wouldn't believe it if it hadn't happened to me.' Joseph Smith said something very similar. By the way, if Joseph was telling the truth, then you'd better join the Mormon Church right away, because it represents the one true spiritual path, rendering all others unsanctioned by God. Is his fantastic story true? I have no idea, but I hope so. I hope every healing opportunity is true. About the author: Watch the free video The AHA!

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) For more than a year Health Canada held on to a report that concluded there is a 'strong relationship' between lung cancer and chrysotile asbestos mined in Canada. The report was authored by a panel of international experts and was received by Health Canada in March 2008. Trevor Ogden, the panel chairman for the report, made repeated requests to Health Canada to have the report made public, but the requests were resisted. Ogden referred to the delay as 'an annoying piece of needless government secrecy.' The report was obtained by Canadian media outlet Canwest News Service under Access to Information legislation, but only after 10 months of processing. The panel's report found a less certain connection between chrysotile asbestos and mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. However, the report did find a strong connection between chrysotile asbestos and lung cancer, according to Ogden writing in an introductory letter. In the letter, Ogden, who is editor-in-chief of The Annals of Occupational Hygiene in Britain, also noted that the panel included members who have previously expressed opposing views on the subject, including industry consultant David Bernstein, who was previously involved with asbestos producer Union Carbide Corp, as well as Canadian and California asbestos mining companies. A Health Canada spokesman said the delay in releasing the report was due to taking time necessary to carefully review the report's findings and to consult other federal and provincial partners. Leslie Stayner, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois School of Public Health, commented on details of the report which also included amphibole asbestos as having a connection to risk of mesothelioma. 'The most important thing is what it doesn't say, which is some people have alleged it would say. What it doesn't say is that exposure to chrysotile asbestos is safe,' said Stayner. 'I think the bottom line here is that all forms of asbestos cause both mesothelioma and lung cancer. We will probably for many years still be debating this question of relative hazard of chrysotile. The fundamental question of whether it's hazardous or not is clear. I think the answer to that is, yes, chrysotile is a hazardous substance.' The report's release has reopened debate on the future of the asbestos industry in Canada , and particularly in the province of Quebec where the industry is concentrated. Member of Parliament Pat Martin, who has long been a supporter of a ban on Canada's asbestos industry, said the panel's conclusions should be taken seriously and should initiate government action on the matter. 'It makes our case. The reality is we're at a tipping point. The jig is up for the asbestos industry,' said Martin, who once worked in an asbestos plant in Yukon without being warned of the health risks. Most uses of asbestos are banned in Canada, and all uses for all forms of asbestos have been banned in Europe and Australia. But Canada remains one of the world's largest chrysotile asbestos exporters in the world with more than $100 million of exports in 2008, primarily to developing countries like India and Indonesia. Other countries that have imported Canadian asbestos since 2007 include the U.S., Columbia, Brazil, Peru, Pakistan, China, and Ecuador. Countries that have banned all types of asbestos without exceptions include Bulgaria, Egypt, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Uraguay, Chile, and Iceland. Chrysotile asbestos is the most commonly encountered form of asbestos, accounting for about 95% of asbestos found in the United States.

0," Yokohama Tire, the North American subsidiary of Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd., has introduced a new tire that replaces much of its petroleum with oil derived from orange peels instead. 'The eco-focused dB Super E-spec mixes sustainable orange oil and natural rubber to drastically cut the use of petroleum, without compromising performance,' said Dan King, the company's vice president of sales. 'It also helps consumers save money at the gas pump by improving fuel efficiency via a 20-percent reduction in rolling resistance.' The tire, known by the moniker Super E-spec, is made from vulcanized rubber just like other tires. While most vulcanized rubber tires use petroleum combined with natural rubber, the Super E-spec has replaced 80 percent of its petroleum use with orange oil. The oil is extracted from what Yokohama calls a 'no-emission factory' and acquires orange peels from an orange juice factory next door. The Super E-spec has already been introduced into Yokohama's line of racing tires and is now used exclusively at the Porsche GT3 Cup race 'Patron GT3 Challenge.' It has been used in both short and 24-hour races. 'The idea of combining oil from orange peels with natural rubber was conceived by our racing engineers,' said director of corporate strategy and planning Mark Chung. 'The tire has been tested in racing applications to see what the true limitations are. The level of technology has matured to where we offer it for the passenger car lineup.' Initially, the Super E-spec will be offered in 15- and 16-inch diameters for hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Camry hybrid, Honda Civic hybrid and Honda Accord hybrid, as well as some non-hybrid cars including the Nissan Versa, Volkswagen Golf and natural gas-powered GX. Eventually, the tires will be offered in other sizes for both cars and sport-utility vehicles. The company has not released information on how the ecological impact of disposing of the Super E-spec compares with disposing of other tires.

0," Tweet Here's a brief overview of some of the campaigns of terror the FDA has initiated against natural healers, nutritional supplement companies and other organizations. Many were conducted using armed agents wielding assault rifles and automatic weapons, dressed in body armor. All of them were intended to destroy natural medicine, thereby protecting the profits of drug companies and conventional medicine practitioners. This is the true history of the FDA that the FDA doesn't wan't you to know! (This timeline is excerpted from my book Natural Health Solutions and the Conspiracy to Keep You From Knowing About Them ) RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) 1987: The Life Extension Raids The Life Extension Foundation ( www.LEF.org ) has long been targeted by the FDA. It is a non-profit organization that publishes information about the healing power of nutritional supplements and genuine anti-aging breakthroughs from the world of natural health. On February 26, 1987, approximately 25 armed FDA agents and U.S. Marshals burst through the glass doors of the Ft. Lauderdale offices of the Life Extension Foundation with guns drawn. A second group of FDA agents simultaneously attacked the LEF warehouse, where they detained LEF founder William Faloon at gunpoint. Employees were lined up against the wall and searched. Agents rifled through the personal belonging of the employees and confiscated many items. Over the next 12 hours, they seized thousands of items, including nutritional products, files, and documents, including 5,000 newsletters that were about to be mailed to subscribers. Computers and telephones were reportedly, 'ripped from the wall,' and agents seized anything they could find regardless of whether such items were actually named in the search warrant. Later analysis revealed that 80 percent of the seized items were never named in the warrant. Not surprisingly, the entire legal basis for the raid was fraudulent to begin with. The search warrant, issued by Magistrate Lurana S. Snow, was based on perjured testimony by FDA agent Martin Katz. But the intent to terrorize the Life Extension Foundation worked: Employees suffered nightmares and many were afraid to come to work. Rather than giving in to the tyranny of the FDA, Bill Faloon and the Life Extension Foundation chose to fight for their First Amendment rights. As explained by Saul Kent of the Life Extension Foundation at www.LEF.org: Everyone we consulted, including attorneys who were FDA 'experts', told us we had to submit to the FDA's authority to have any chance of surviving. We ignored all this advice and instead decided to wage all-out war against the FDA. We did this knowing that we would not only risk our livelihood, but our personal freedom as well . We were told again and again that the FDA had the unlimited resources of the federal government at its disposal, and that an organization with fewer than 5,000 members had no chance of winning an all-out war with them. To further terrorize the Life Extension Foundation and its founders, the FDA, with the help of various corrupt law enforcement bodies, filed 56 criminal charges against Foundation officers Saul Kent and William Faloon. After an 11-year reign of terror in which the FDA spent millions of taxpayer dollars attempting to prosecute them, Kent and Faloon prevailed. In November, 1995, Federal Judge Daniel Hurley dismissed 55 of the 56 charges, and in February, 1996, the final charge was dismissed. And thus ended the FDA's campaign of terror against the Life Extension Foundation. It was the first time in 88 years that the FDA had been forced to give up its prosecution efforts and throw in the towel. As Saul Kent says, 'The FDA's dismissal of the charges against me (and Bill Faloon) is an unprecedented victory against FDA tyranny that goes far beyond winning in court. The FDA's historic defeat is a victory for everyone who cherishes freedom in healthcare.' In 1994, the Life Extension Foundation established the FDA Holocaust Museum to document the decades-long reign of terror the FDA has perpetrated against the American people. 1990 - The El Cajon pet food store raid In 1990, FDA agents raided the pet food store of Sissy Harrington-McGill, a 57-year-old pet lover who was guilty of the 'crime' of claiming that vitamins would help keep pets healthy. Without a search warrant, FDA agents ransacked her store, confiscating products and literature. She was later tried and convicted of violating the Health Claims Law, a law that did not exist at the time of the raid and was never passed by the U.S. Congress. Nonetheless, likely due to FDA pressure on the presiding judge, she was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined $10,000 for daring to say that vitamins are good for puppy dogs! 1990 - The Highland Laboratories raid In 1990, Ken Scott ran a vitamin business in Mt. Angel, Oregon, a small rural town. He was selling nutritional supplements containing coenzyme Q10, a vital nutrient for cellular energy that has received tremendous praise from the scientific community for boosting cardiovascular health, preventing congestive heart failure, improving blood pressure and cholesterol profiles, as well as many other benefits. To help educate customers about the healing power of CoQ10, he offered to send reprints of magazine and newspaper articles describing some of the scientific findings about the nutrient. This public education effort, of course, would not be tolerated by the FDA Gestapo. So the FDA organized an armed raid comprised of nine FDA agents, 11 U.S. Marshals and eight Oregon state police. With guns drawn, they kicked in the doors to Ken Scott's business and conducted one of the most terror-driven 'vitamin' raids in U.S. history. For the next 11 hours, agents confiscated nearly everything they could find at Highland Laboratories. Ken Scott and his employees were threatened with violence if they tried to set foot in the office, and his daughter, who was located miles away, was illegally detained and held in 'house arrest' for 12 hours. The FDA, you see, would not tolerate Ken Scott mailing scientific literature or articles to his customers. So in order to comply with the FDA, Scott later hired an outside mailing service owned by his daughter to run the article mailing operations. The FDA's response to that? They illegally raided the mailing service company and threatened to confiscate the checkbook and cash of its owner. Out of fear (terrorism works, you see?), that owner subsequently closed her business and refused to file charges against the FDA. Ken Scott was ultimately forced to cut a deal with prosecutors, and eventually served five years on probation for his 'crime' of telling the truth about CoQ10. The message from the FDA to other vitamin companies couldn't be more clear: Don't you dare tell your customers the truth about vitamins, or we'll shut you down and prosecute you! 1990: The Century Clinic 'chelation' raids In Reno, Nev., 1990, the Century Clinic was raided by the FDA and Postal Service inspectors. Agents seized large quantities of items from the clinic, virtually wiping it out of computers and equipment, as well as patient records and files. No charges were filed. After Century Clinic rebuilt and sued the FDA for the return of its property, the FDA raided it again and conducted a search of the persons and homes of the owners and employees. Patients at the clinic were reportedly interrogated and not allowed to leave without turning over their names and addresses. No charges were ever filed against the clinic or its owners. 1991: The Tijuana cancer clinic kidnapping Jimmy Keller cured his own cancer through the use of natural medicine therapies. Encouraged by success with his own cancer, he pursued a career in natural medicine and later moved to Mexico and opened a clinic that could legally treat U.S. patients with the disease (treating cancer naturally is illegal in the United States, so the best practitioners are forced to open clinics in Mexico or other countries). The success of this clinic caught the eye of health authorities in the United States, and they decided to put a stop to it. In March 1991, armed Mexican police officers, with no warrants or charges whatsoever, kidnapped Keller from the St. Jude Hospital and delivered him to U.S. Justice Department bounty hunters who, against his will, drove him across the border to the USA. There, the FBI arrested him and charged him with wire fraud (Keller had used the telephone to hold conversations with prospective patients). Keller was later convicted of wire fraud and sent to a North Dakota prison for two years. His kidnapping and arrest are blatantly illegal under international law. 1992 - Raid on Nature's Way In 1992 in Utah; the FDA seized bulk primrose oil from Nature's Way, a manufacturer that offers some of the highest-quality supplements in the business. Nature's Way filed a lawsuit to get their product returned, but was forced to remove the natural Vitamin E from the formulation, as the FDA insisted that Vitamin E had not been approved as an additive for primrose oil. 1992 - The Tahoma Clinic FDA Raid On May 6, 1992, FDA agents joined armed King County police officers in an armed raid against the clinic of Dr. Jonathan Wright, an M.D. and natural health practitioner. His crime? He was treating patients with injectable high-dose B vitamins -- a safe, natural treatment -- and in doing so was actually helping patients heal . The armed agents smashed down the door, rushed into the clinic like a SWAT team with guns drawn, terrorizing the patients and shouting at them to put their hands in the air. Over the next fourteen hours, agents rifled through Dr. Wright's clinic, seizing patient records, computers, vitamin supplies, and various natural therapy products. The FDA illegally held on to confiscated items, including the computers needed to run his clinic, for three years. But was Dr. Wright really so dangerous as to justify an armed raid? He's a graduate of Harvard and the University of Michigan Medical School. He's a book author, a prolific public speaker, and served as the nutrition editor of Prevention magazine for more than ten years. The purpose of the FDA raid was clearly not to arrest Dr. Wright, who was never charged. Rather, the purpose appears to be conducting a campaign of terror: sending a message to the alternative medicine community that anyone engaged in nutritional treatments could be raided and shut down, with no legal justification. It was all part of the FDA's campaign against natural health treatments, a campaign that continues to this day. 1992: The Texas vitamin store raids In 1992, the FDA prompted the Texas Department of Health (TDH) and the Texas Department of Food and Drug to conduct raids on more than 12 health food stores. Agents seized flaxseed oil, aloe vera, zinc supplements, vitamin C, and even Sleepytime Tea. One health food store owner was reportedly threatened by TDH with, 'Don't talk to the press, or we'll come down on you twice as hard!' None of the confiscated products were ever returned to the store owners, no charges were filed, and no reason for the raids was ever given. The raids were simply a campaign of terror designed to destroy the inventory and disrupt business operations of stores selling natural health products. 1993: The health food store raids In 1993, the war against health freedom reached its peak in Texas, where combined forces of the FDA, DEA, IRS, U.S. Customs, and U.S. Postal Services conducted commando-style raids on nearly 40 different health food stores, vitamin companies, and natural health clinics from May through September. The homes of company owners and employees were also raided, and some raids were conducted with SWAT teams brandishing assault weapons and flak jackets. In one home, a mother who was breast feeding her infant was reportedly 'roughed up and handcuffed for 11 hours while FDA agents ransacked her home.' Items seized in the raids included vitamins, minerals, herbs, and nutritional supplements. IRS officials also seized computers, automobiles, and bank accounts. The U.S. Postal Service illegally blocked the mail of some of the targeted companies, denying them the ability to conduct business or even organize a legal defense. Targeted products included Dr. Kurt Donsbach's nutritional products and Dr. Hans Neiper's German-made health products. The 1963 Church of Scientology raid In the early 1960s, the FDA got word of something it didn't like: The Church of Scientology was helping its members overcome mental problems with the use of a simple biofeedback device called the E-meter. With the market for psychotropic drugs so consistently profitable, and with Scientology gaining momentum in helping millions of people overcome severe emotional and mental problems, this E-meter had to be taken out of play and fast! To do so, the FDA filed a 'libel of information' with a U.S. District Court, after which Judge William B. Jones ordered a warrant authorizing the arrest of the E-meters. Yes, the meters themselves were to be arrested. The warrant also authorized the arrest of 'an undetermined number of items of written, printed or graphic matter.' With the warrant issued, armed U.S. Marshals and FDA agents launched a military-style raid on the church. According to sworn affidavits of eyewitnesses, the agents 'burst into the church offices and loudly demanded and threatened all in sight; observed absolutely no courtesies except for not actually shooting the guns they carried, and denied to the Church administrators any opportunity to arrange that students and Church members not be disturbed, upset or terrorized. 'Showing no legal warrant, the agents and deputies pounded their way up stairways, bursting into confessional and pastoral counseling sessions, causing disruption and violently preventing the quiet pursuit of the normal practice of religious philosophy. 'They seized all the publications and all the confessional aids called E-meters they could find in desks, in ladies' handbags, in students' briefcases and in the session rooms. ' the agents removed from the church to the waiting vans some tens of thousands of copies of over twenty Church books, texts, recorded sermons; even the Church archives were sacked. The confiscated material was handled roughly, and when ministers of the Church asked that their property be handled more carefully, the 'deputies' from Baltimore gave only sneering illiteracies for answer.' In all, three tons of materials were seized. In clear violation of both the First and Fourth Amendments, the FDA had illegally used its powers to spread yet more fear and terror through the world -- this time, to raid a church. All religions have healing tools Of course, Scientology is not as mainstream as Christianity, Buddhism, or Catholicism, but since when did religions have to be popular to enjoy equal protection under the U.S. Constitution? Besides, various churches have always attributed special healing powers to their particular tools. Roman Catholic churches have Holy Water and other healing elements (Easter wafers, Saint Glaize Candles, Scapulars, and so on). Other religions use prayer clothes, prayer oils, and various pieces of string for which healing benefits are commonly prescribed. Nearly all churches recognize prayer as an effective form of healing. Yet the FDA chose to single out Scientology's E-meter machine, likely because it perceived the device as presenting a genuine threat to psychiatry's monopoly over mental health treatment. The FDA, you see, believes it not only regulates foods, drugs, and cosmetics, but also religions. Only 'mainstream' religious practices will be allowed, and any such religions that use alternative symbols, rituals, or scriptures will be prosecuted, regardless of what the Constitution says. The rule of law never interferes with the FDA's campaigns of terror. The history of the U.S. government's persecution of the Church of Scientology is long and complex, and it is a sad demonstration of true religious intolerance right here in the United States. The First Amendment, which protects both Free Speech and Religion, offers no real protection against the criminals at the FDA, who have for decades attempted to suppress alternative philosophies that actually help people heal. After nine years of protracted legal battles, and the expenditure of countless millions in taxpayer dollars that funded the prosecution efforts, the Church of Scientology achieved a victory in the courts, and the FDA was forced to return the E-meters. Yet, just to inflict a little more pain and punishment upon the Church, the court ordered the Church of Scientology to pay for all the warehousing costs of the confiscated items held over the previous nine years, plus all the legal fees of the government's prosecution efforts. The courts also ruled that all Scientology literature describing the E-meter must carry a warning message written by the FDA, and that the church must pay the salaries and travel expenses of FDA agents who would, from time to time, visit the church to ensure compliance with the courts. (Source: The Hidden Story of Scientology, Omar V. Garrison, page 143.) In other words, the Church of Scientology was to be severely punished for daring to oppose the tyranny of the FDA. Just as a factory-working Jewish prisoner who talked back to his Nazi captors in 1942 would be beaten and shot, the FDA made sure that the Church of Scientology would pay a dear price for daring to question the authority of this all-powerful federal agency, an agency that could summon the aid of firearms-brandishing law enforcement officials at any time, for apparently any reason, regardless of its legality.

0," While many people still need convincing that choosing organic foods is better for their own health as well as for the environment, that's not the case for Wisconsin residents. There, the organic industry is taking off in full force due to the high demand for healthy foods. The state, which has the second highest number of organic farms in the country, boasts 69 organic beef and 466 organic dairy farms, as well as 161 organic vegetable and melon farms. While the fact that people throughout the state want to eat foods void of harmful pesticides and disturbing growing practices is certainly uplifting news, residents are discovering that their demand is building faster than the actual supply of such foods. (1) Rather than seeing this as a problem, many view this surge in organic preferences as an optimistic trend in which healthy lifestyles are chosen over Frankenfoods. Sure, the demand is outpacing the supply, but the fact that the demand is there in the first place shows that people desire healthy options. Furthermore, it's not expected that there will be any food depletion issues due to demand exceeding supply; experts point to consumer and population trends that will likely create balance and meet everyone's needs. Wisconsin poised to keep its organic agriculture thriving Dr. Erin Silva, co-author of the 'Organic Agriculture in Wisconsin 2015 Status Report,' says that it's highly unlikely that consumers will slow down in their requests for organic foods. 'With the demand still strong,' she said, 'we don't foresee a potential erosion of the organic premium. The projections do continue to see demand increasing over the next five years or so.' (1) In addition to increased health awareness in general, Silva also says that younger generations who are interested in organic farming will propel the demand while ensuring its availability. (1) The report, produced by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showcases just how Wisconsin's agriculture is thriving. It notes: Agriculture is a driver of Wisconsin's economy, generating $88 billion for the state annually and contributing nearly 12 percent of Wisconsin's jobs. While organic production is a small part of this industry, it is a critical means of tapping into a rapidly growing agricultural market. The Organic Trade Association reports that organic sales are increasing at a rate of nearly 12 percent per year, and 81 percent of U.S. families are choosing organic food at least sometimes. (2) The report goes on to express how today's generations -- and subsequent ones -- are being eyed as the force that will maintain these impressive statistics: Organic agriculture in Wisconsin continues to grow at a steady and gratifying pace. Consumer demand, an important impetus for new organic production, is strong and represented in all age groups and income levels. Farmers are growing older, and bringing new faces to the profession is an important focus of the agricultural community. Many young and beginning farmers are enthusiastically entering organic agriculture and seeking support from educational, financial and governmental institutions. Wisconsin's technical schools, colleges and universities offer courses in organic production and conduct cutting-edge research to further Wisconsin's organic industry. (2) Report outlines optimism, solutions despite potential organic farming challenges While optimistic, the report notes that keeping organic farming practices in place is not simply about switching from conventional farming practices. A great deal of learning, training and resources such as obtaining and maintaining drying bins and specific kinds of machinery are needed when it comes to organic agriculture, something that's outlined in the report as a potential challenge. But even then, the report presents ideas such as 'creating networks of organic grain farmers' in which resources can be pooled. (2) Farmland rental prices and start-up costs are also mentioned as challenges in the report, with an urging for farmers, nonprofit organizations and state and federal agencies to work together to keep organic agriculture going strong in the state. 'We certainly hope that with the interest of new farmers and a younger population in organic farming that that helps maintain and continues to support the overall agricultural economy,' says Silva. (1) Studies have shown that consuming organic foods is considerably better for health, as they're generally free of antibiotics, pesticides and the problems associated with genetic modification. As such, good health is maintained while horror stories that include even death are kept at bay. (3) "
0," Imagine constantly being yelled at, physically harmed, and witnessing traumatic events on a daily basis. Obviously, such abuse and stress isn't healthy or enjoyable, so you'd do your best to try to avoid such situations, right? Well, according to a recent study published in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience , people are willingly putting themselves through such abuse every single day. However, this isn't about domestic violence or other high-stress situations, but rather all about the junk foods they're eating. Specifically, the study's researchers focused on how sugar can alter a part of the brain called the hippocampus, which is related to stress and memory. Interestingly, they found that a high-sugar diet alters this portion of the brain in a way that closely mimics the changes that occur when one is exposed to abusive and stressful situations in the early developmental stages of life. (1,2) That's right, when it comes to your brain, consuming a high-sugar diet is akin to being abused. Still want that soda and candy bar? Experts say controlling excessive sugar intake could reduce 'burden of psychiatric disorders' In a Daily Mail article discussing their findings, study authors Jayanthi Maniam and Margaret Morris elaborate on the eye-opening issue. 'People who were exposed to early life trauma have changes in the structure of their hippocampus. In humans, those consuming the most 'western' diet had smaller hippocampal volumes, in line with data from animal models.' (1) The authors express concern over the fact that many people do not shun sugar ; in fact, quite the opposite is true. 'The changes in the brain induced by sugar are of great concern given the high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, with particularly high consumption in children aged nine to 16 years.' (1) Further elaboration in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience states the following: '... early life adversity and high sugar diet may independently increase the risk for psychopathology later in life. ... The similarity in the hippocampal molecular deficits induced by sugar and early life stress is of great concern given the cheap and easy accessibility of sugar-sweetened beverages ... Manipulating the later environment of those exposed to early life adversity, and controlling the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages across the community may be an effective way to curtail the burden of psychiatric disorders.' (2) Those are some powerful words, folks. The fact that excessive sugar consumption may be linked to psychiatric disorders , is not something to ignore. After all, it's perfectly logical. More and more proof that sugar is addictive and mind-altering Sure, we know that too much of the refined stuff contributes to obesity , diabetes and other health problems, but worse than that, it can alter brain function and personality. In fact, it's downright addictive. For example, studies have found that sugar acts as a stress suppressant. If you think there's nothing wrong with that, consider that sugar has been shown to make comfort-craving people become addicted. The fact that sugar diminishes stress levels in the brain makes stressed out folks reach for sugary sodas and similar junk foods all the more, reinforcing a seemingly never-ending chain of unhealthy behaviors. (3) Other studies continue to expose the harms associated with consuming so much refined sugar. Researchers from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA have also noted the hazards associated with consuming too much sugar and fructose. Published details indicate that they wreak havoc on memory and cognition in teens and young adults, making the strong case that what a person eats is directly related to the brain's ability to function optimally. (4) The bottom line, as shown by numerous studies, including this more recent one by Jayanthi Maniam and Margaret Morris, is that refined sugar and the junk foods filled with it can severely compromise the brain and body. Do your best to avoid added sugars by eating fresh, whole foods , and plenty of nuts and seeds, and try to help friends and family members eat in the same sensible manner. "
0," Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body. It is used in the cardiovascular system to contract and dilate blood vessels. It is the mineral that makes muscles contract. It helps cells send signals and nerves to transmit those signals to the brain. Most people know calcium as the mineral that makes healthy bones and teeth. While many people know that calcium can be absorbed through food or dietary supplements, few people know there are powerful herbs containing calcium. These herbs are horsetail and oat straw. Calcium is very tightly regulated in the bloodstream. Extra calcium is stored in bone and dental tissue, and the body retrieves calcium from the bones and teeth if more is needed. As the body ages, particularly among postmenopausal women, bone loss exceeds bone repair if there is not enough dietary calcium intake. Horsetail and oat straw can help supply extra calcium for the bones. Horsetail shows promise in healing osteoporosis The University of Maryland Medical Center published a clinical study in 1999 involving 122 women who took horsetail extract or a calcium/horsetail product marketed in Italy. Both sets of women saw an improvement in bone density. Even though the study was not performed to current scientific standards, the results did still show promise for horsetail in healing osteoporosis. The reason why horsetail, also called shave grass, may work to restore bone loss is because of the high levels of plant silica in horsetail. In the body, silica converts to calcium . The late master herbalist Dr. John Ray Christopher called horsetail a 'master calcium herb,' and used it along with oat straw, comfrey root, and lobelia in his herbal calcium tea formula. Nobel prize nominee C. Louis Kervran wrote extensively about the parallels between plant silica and calcium in his book, Biological Transmutation . Oat straw strengthens bones and teeth by stimulating cell growth Oat straw, the green oat grass in the 'milky' stage before the oat tops become mature, is also very high in calcium. Many herbalists promote and use oat straw to help strengthen bones in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Integrative Herbal Communications published a clinical study performed in 2000 which showed that rats fed oat straw showed a rise in luteinizing hormones. These hormones stimulate cell growth, including osteoblasts, the cells that promote bone and teeth development. Horsetail and oat straw tea deliver absorbable calcium to the body Refined white sugar, white flour products, alcohol, soft drinks, the use of steroids, and junk foods leach calcium from the bones in order to correct the acid formation in the blood and tissues of the body. Varicose veins, muscle cramps and 'Charlie horses,' tooth decay and loss, painful teething in babies, and anxiety issues are all due to calcium imbalances. A simple hot tea made with equal parts horsetail and and oat straw taken three times a day may help relieve the symptoms of all of the above health concerns. A different recipe calls for a combination of oat straw, horsetail, comfrey leaves, and lobelia to combine the calcium in horsetail and oat straw with the bone-knitting properties of comfrey. Lobelia is an adaptogen which helps the other herbs work together. Sources: Office of Dietary Supplements.

0," Tens of millions of Americans are obese, and while figures have stabilized in recent years according to government findings , the numbers are still staggering. Poor dietary choices rank high as a cause of obesity, but another factor -- and in my view, one that gets far less attention -- is Americans' increasing lack of physical activity. In fact, a new study found that the average obese woman only gets one hour of vigorous exercise per year , while men don't get much more -- less than four per year. The findings, published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings , stem from the tracking of participants' movements over the course of a year. Researchers collected data regarding the amount of exercise participants engaged in and at what intensity level(s). Researchers defined vigorous exercise as jogging or other high-cardio-related, fat-burning exercises. For those who were considered extremely overweight, walking may be considered vigorous. For women especially, researchers cited extremely busy lives as a major reason why they exercised so little. Between work, caring for children and sleep, they noted, women did not have much time in the day to devote to fitness. 'They're living their lives from one chair to another,' Edward Archer, a research fellow with the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, told HealthDay . 'We didn't realize we were that sedentary. There are some people who are vigorously active, but it's offset by the huge number of individuals who are inactive.' Getting started in a fitness program Granted, finding the time to work in a fitness program is difficult in today's busy world. But almost everyone has time for some sort of activity 3-4 times per week, if they really want to change their lifestyle. So, the next hurdle to overcome is actually finding a fitness program that you can stick with . Most people who begin a fitness program don't stick with it, most often because it isn't the right program for them. So I asked a group of fitness experts what they would recommend for someone just beginning a fitness program: -- Gauge yourself. J. Anderson, certified personal trainer, selfnews contributor and founder/editor of Always Active Athletics , says to take some photos of yourself before you start your program and do some fitness tests, to see where you're at physically. 'If you are having a down day' after you begin a program, 'you can look at old photographs or re-take your fitness tests to see just how far you have really come.' Motivation . -- Don't attempt too much at first. Ainslie MacEachran, a certified personal trainer and cycling coach with Gemini Training Systems , located in Fort Collins, Colo., says you should set small goals initially. 'Break up your goals into little bit size pieces. Instead of trying to do it all at once, make little goals along the way that work towards your ultimate end goal,' she told me. -- Don't go it alone. Get a friend to start a program with you, says expert fitness trainer and former collegiate gymnastics star Kari Pearce of Innovative Fitness Trainers . 'Exercising with someone else often makes it more enjoyable and you will want to push yourself harder,' she told selfnews . -- Pick something fun. Kim Evans, a professional fitness coach at Wello in Grand Haven, Mich., says the dance-exercise Zumba might be a good fit for a beginner, mostly because the classes are inviting, not intimidating. 'That is a huge deal,' she told me, because 'many classes can be intimidating for the new exerciser.' Dr. Kim Chronister, a clinical psychologist and author of the book The Psychology Behind Fitness Motivation , agrees. She said in an email that a great way to get 'motivated is by finding fun activities to get into (i.e. dancing salsa for one hour or playing water polo for an hour).' -- Get in the right mindset. In order to stick with any program, you have to decide that it is for the long haul. 'When you take the time to transform your thoughts, beliefs and patterns, making lasting change is easy and effortless,' Michelle Hastie, of Total Body Health Solutions , said. -- Don't make excuses. It's easy to blow off your exercise session by convincing yourself that you don't have time today or something else 'came up,' says Josh Greene, who has a bachelor's degree in in Kinesiology from Indiana University and is currently a personal trainer at Anytime Fitness in Indianapolis. 'It takes as little as 20-30 minutes for someone to do a vigorous workout. And doing that 2-3 times per week is much more beneficial than someone doing absolutely nothing,' he told selfnews .

0," Russia has placed a destructive 'Trojan Horse' malware program in the software that operates most of America's critical infrastructure, making it possible for Moscow to cause economic catastrophe throughout the U.S., the Department of Homeland Security has now warned. The cyber operation is the modern-day equivalent of the Cold War's concept of nuclear MAD -- mutual assured destruction -- because intelligence analysts believe the United States has likely achieved similar inroads into Russian (and likely Chinese) infrastructure. However, the penetration of American financial infrastructure could be even more potentially devastating, considering that the U.S. financial and banking system and Wall Street provide the backbone for global trade, as part of the world's largest economy. Also, the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency; any disruption of the American economic system would likely cause a dollar collapse and lead to global financial pandemonium. 'No random attack' In addition to having major financial implications, national security sources and intelligence analysts note that the malware has also penetrated other vital infrastructure -- that which is used to 'control complex industrial operations like oil and gas pipelines, power transmission grids, water distribution and filtration systems, wind turbines and even some nuclear plants,' ABC News reported. Shutting any of these vital systems down could adversely impact millions of Americans, and could even lead to destruction and death. In a bulletin, DHS warned that the Russia-sponsored hacking attack has been continuous since 2011, though no attempt has yet been made to activate the malware to 'damage, modify, or otherwise disrupt' America's industrial and infrastructure control processes. As such, though American intelligence agencies and the Obama Administration have only recently been made aware of the breach, no one knows where or when the malware could be activated. 'DHS sources told ABC News they think this is no random attack and they fear that the Russians have torn a page from the old, Cold War playbook, and have placed the malware in key U.S. systems as a threat, and/or as a deterrent to a U.S. cyber-attack on Russian systems -- mutually assured destruction,' the network reported on its website. Intelligence community insiders learned about the penetration in late October; at that time, DHS' Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert bulletin to industry members outlining the breach. The bulletin reported that the 'BlackEnergy' penetration was detected by several private industrial firms recently. ABC News reported further: DHS said 'BlackEnergy' is the same malware that was used by a Russian cyber-espionage group dubbed 'Sandworm' to target NATO and some energy and telecommunications companies in Europe earlier this year. 'Analysis of the technical findings in the two reports shows linkages in the shared command and control infrastructure between the campaigns, suggesting both are part of a broader campaign by the same threat actor,' the DHS bulletin said. 'The more I worked on the issue, the more concerned I became' DHS officials said that the hacker software is very advanced, meaning it most likely was developed by a state actor with unlimited resources, rather than a non-state actor as a terrorist weapon. The malware can be controlled by operators using computers, an iPad or smart phone to control 'various industrial processes,' ABC News reported. The software also allows collaborative control and information sharing. The 2010 book Cyber War , by Richard A. Clarke, who served as a national security expert in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Georg W. Bush, warned that the nation's critical infrastructure -- financial, transportation, water, electrical and communications -- were vulnerable to penetration and attack. He describes such tactics as 'asymmetrical warfare,' and he noted that China was likely a bigger threat than Russia. Clarke noted that, during the administration of Bill Clinton, he was assigned to draft a Presidential Decision Document (PDD) outlining the risks to both government and private industrial systems, but said he was given no authority to implement his recommendations. 'The more I worked on the issue, the more concerned I became,' he wrote, adding that by 2000, the Clinton Administration 'developed a National Plan for Information Systems Protection, but there was still no willingness in the government to regulate the industries that ran the vulnerable critical infrastructure.'

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A lot of people are realizing the importance of upgrading their diets, but sometimes it's the change part where people get a little stuck. If that's what is going on with you, why not start adding green smoothies to your diet as a first (or second) step in the right direction. Greens are important blood builders and detoxifiers. They're also vitamin and mineral dense, but let's face it: most people don't eat anywhere near enough of them. Green smoothies are an easy and delicious way to change that. Bananas are often at the base of green smoothies, and if they're peeled and frozen first, they can add an ice cream like consistency. Of course, you can also add whatever other fruit you like. Apples, pineapple, Mexican (but not Hawaiian) papaya, watermelon, strawberries and grapes are all good options. Then, just add a cup or so of greens like spinach, parsley, or stemmed dinosaur kale, water, and a little of a natural sweetener. Then, blend and you're all set. A little stevia or organic honey can go a long way in making your green smoothies taste more like a dessert than a health food drink too. Many people find that adding green smoothies to their daily routine also boosts their energy levels - without coffee. Plus, it's an easy, delicious way to upgrade your diet - without even trying very hard. Greens are also chock full of chlorophyll, which helps us rebuild our blood, and it goes without saying that healthy blood is critical to healthy people. Clean and healthy blood also seems to add a vibrancy to people - so if you or your life is feeling a little dull, it's one way to start addressing a root cause of the problem. You can also power up your green smoothies with other super foods, like maca or the insides of a fresh aloe vera leaf. But, for taste and simplicity reasons, if you're just getting started on the health kick, it might be better to start slowly and add in more later, after you're already in the routine. Along with other fruit, or maybe soaked nuts, green smoothies make a great breakfast.

Cleaning Up! offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book, people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems, as well as just losing excess weight, thinking more clearly, and feeling better. Kim's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible. She's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them. Here's a little from the upcoming book... In Isaiah 22:20, it says, 'And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant, namely Elia kim .' But, because these prophecies are cryptic and they aren't meant to be understood until they are understood, it's only the last three letters. A few lines later, it says, 'From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them.' Here, you just take out any three middle letters, and again, it's the name of the person bringing you this message, or the sacred secret of the prophecy. Actually, if you take those two passages, Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them. In Numbers 1:1 1:18, it's talking about 'the family' and mentions Pagiel. It also twice mentions February 1st, (Kim's birthday) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old. Kim's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old. In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing. Kim's middle name is Jo and her older sister's name is Brandi. There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name. Of course, it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades. It's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing, if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace. In this text, he even says things like, 'You'll never see the father unless you clean your colon.' But, this is paraphrased... In the Bible Jesus says things more like, happy are those who wash their robes, as they can enter the tree of life. The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God's paradise. He also said, first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean. Kim's book Cleaning Up! is here http://www.cleaningupcleanse.com .

0," After years of dodging the issue, natural grocery chain Whole Foods Market has gone public with plans to require the labeling of all foods sold in its stores that contain genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). The only problem is that the new labeling requirements will not come into effect until 2018, which has already generated quite a bit of controversy as to why this natural and organic leader would wait an additional five years to act on such a pertinent issue. According to an announcement made on the Whole Foods website, the company is a strong supporter of food labeling transparency, and has been working for years to voluntarily remove GMOs from its 365 Everyday Value line of products. Whole Foods has also been vigilant in supporting the Non-GMO Project, an independent verification system designed to phase out the use of GMOs in foods. 'Our goal at Whole Foods Market is to provide informed consumer choice with regard to genetically engineered ingredients,' explains the company on its website. 'Accordingly, we have set a deadline that, by 2018, all products in our U.S. and Canadian stores must be labeled to indicate whether they contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Whole Foods Market is the first national grocery chain to set a deadline for full GMO transparency.' This move by Whole Foods is unprecedented, as it shows just how far we have come as a society towards achieving real food transparency. It also shows that we may truly be on the cusp of reaching critical mass awareness about the presence of GMOs in the food supply -- millions of Americans now know about GMOs, and many of them are actively trying to avoid GMOs for the health of their families, which is good news for everyone. Phasing out GMOs takes time, claim some But why the long wait? Since many of the food products sold at Whole Foods quietly contain GMOs, the retailer is likely giving its suppliers and brands more time to completely phase out the use of GMOs before the deadline so as not to have to label anything by the time 2018 rolls around. What grocer, after all, that claims to sell 'nothing artificial, ever,' would willingly emblazon the equivalent of a skull and crossbones on some of its products? Similarly, many ingredients used in food products sold at Whole Foods are still relatively difficult to source organically or from non-GMO sources, claim some in the industry. The vast majority of the nation's sugar beets, canola, corn, and soybeans, for instance, are grown using GM seed stocks. And transitioning GM crop fields to certified-organic ones in order to meet demand can take many years, argue some, which makes it difficult for some companies to convert immediately to non-GMO sources. On the other hand, many relatively large-scale food producers like family-owned Nature's Path are already using non-GMO, certified organic ingredients in their products without issue, so why can't all the others do the same? It all comes down to priorities, and many so-called 'natural' food suppliers are still hesitant to make the switch from GMOs until absolutely necessary -- in this case, by 2018 to meet Whole Foods' new requirements. Overall, the decision by Whole Foods to require GMO labeling is a positive one, and it will immediately spur a transition from GMOs to non-GMOs for many companies who most assuredly do not want to be identified widely and publicly as using GMOs in their products. It is all just par for the course in continuing to expose GMOs far and wide and eventually forcing a complete phase-out of their use through awareness, and of course support from major players like Whole Foods.

0," Tweet Fascinating new research published in the Journal of Nutrition is showing that isolated soy protein demonstrates remarkable health benefits for people suffering from type 2 diabetes. In this research, male military veterans who were undergoing treatment for the advanced stages of type 2 diabetes were able to significantly lower unwanted proteins in their urine while also slightly raising levels of HDL cholesterol - the so-called 'good' cholesterol -- in their blood by eating soy protein. This is fascinating research for several reasons. First of all, there are currently 18 million Americans with diabetes, and the vast majority of those are type 2 diabetics. So this research has potential for treating these millions of Americans. One of the problems with diabetics is diabetic kidney disease, which is often diagnosed by observing the symptom of high protein levels in urine. This protein is almost always in the form of albumin, which is a protein derived from animal-based proteins such as cow's milk or whey protein. What this study shows, however, is that switching from animal-based proteins to soy protein had a measurable beneficial effect on decreasing unwanted proteins in the urine, and presumably promoting healthy kidney function in diabetic patients. This research is also correlating some of what I've been finding in my own experience. For many years I have been recommending whey protein as a good source of protein for those pursuing a low-carbohydrate diet or who simply need a better source of protein other than animal protein. However, I've always held some concern with the idea that whey protein is derived from cow's milk. Cow's milk is something that I have frequently stated should be avoided by all human beings; in fact, cow's milk is the perfect food for baby cows, but not at all a good food for human beings. Strangely, human beings are the only species that will consume a liquid from another species and consider it to be food. From a nutritional standpoint, cow's milk is imbalanced for human consumption and lacks several key nutrients, such as GLA, that are critical to the function of the human brain. One of the other problems with cow's milk is that it contains an animal-based protein, of course. That protein is called casein, and it is this casein that when ingested in large doses promotes diabetic kidney disease and results in high levels of albumin in the urine. But there's another problem with casein, and that's the fact that casein causes stagnation throughout the human body. People who consume large quantities of casein frequently suffer from constipation and chronic sinus congestion. They may also suffer from asthma and mucus in the lungs. Of course, a person who is of outstanding physical health can normally handle a fair amount of casein in their diet without experiencing trouble. However, a person whose health is already compromised, such as anyone with type 2 diabetes, would see the negative impact of casein accelerated in their body. They might suffer from chronic sinus congestion or sinus pain. They may be frequently constipated, or suffer from asthma-like symptoms due to the build-up of mucus in their lungs. In fact, people who drink cow's milk or consume whey protein are, in a way, encouraging the creation of mucus throughout their body -- not only in their sinus areas, but also in their digestive tract and lungs. The way to avoid these problems is to switch to soy protein, and soy protein is something I consume on a regular basis. In fact, now, after further research on casein, I have given up whey protein entirely. Soy protein is useful for many other health conditions, not just type 2 diabetes. It has also been shown to prevent and help fight cancer as well as to stabilize blood sugar levels -- especially in diabetics and people who eat refined carbohydrates. You can get soy protein from soy milk, isolated soy protein powders, tofu, soy cheese, and other products made from soy. Be careful, however, when purchasing isolated soy protein supplements, because you certainly don't want soy protein made with sweeteners -- and the sweeteners to avoid are unfortunately precisely those sweeteners that are frequently used in soy protein products. You don't want sucralose or aspartame, because those are artificial chemical sweeteners with questionable long-term health impacts. Aspartame in particular is known as an excitotoxin and has been shown to cause neurological problems in the human body. You also don't want fructose in your soy protein mix, and fructose is probably the most common ingredient in isolated soy protein powders. Fructose is a form of sugar, and even though it closely mimics the sugar molecules found in fruits, fructose is still a refined white sugar, and that makes any soy protein using fructose a processed food that should be avoided. The only sweetener that's acceptable in soy protein is stevia, and there are very few companies that make isolated soy protein powders that use only stevia as their primary sweetener. I plan to be reviewing some of those in later articles. In the meantime, be sure to check the ingredients on any soy protein products you might be purchasing, and make sure you're not buying products with fructose, aspartame, sucralose, or other sweeteners. But if I had to choose between aspartame and fructose, I would go with fructose, because I think fructose is less damaging to your health than aspartame. If you are a type 2 diabetic, hopefully you're already working with a naturopathic physician. If so, you might want to make them aware of this study and see what advice they might give you on switching to soy protein. It also seems clear that if you are suffering from type 2 diabetes, shifting away from all cow's milk products would be a very good idea in terms of supporting your health. That would mean no milk, no cheese, no dairy products of any kind. For many people following the Atkins diet or low-carb diets, that may prove difficult. But in time, you can switch your tastes from dairy products to soy products, and live the rest of your life quite satisfied from the consumption of soy products. "
0," In the not-too-distant past, the American Medical Association (AMA), which touts itself as the largest association of physicians in the United States, actively conspired to destroy what it perceived as one of its biggest competitors. To this day, that competitor is still treated by many within the mainstream medical clan as questionable when it comes to its legitimacy as a medical practice: chiropractic. Back in 1962, the AMA actually formed a 'Committee on Quackery'. Although it was officially disbanded in 1974 after being publicly exposed, it was later determined by a federal judge to have been established solely for the purpose of leading a conspiracy of 'systematic, long-term wrongdoing and the long-term intent to destroy a licensed profession.' Many conventional doctors have long hated chiropractors because, unlike themselves, chiropractors possess unique healing skills that often aren't taught in the drug industry-generated curriculum of mainline medical schools. Patients who become frustrated with popping pharmaceuticals prescribed by their conventional MDs for every ailment and never finding relief often turn to chiropractors instead, much to the chagrin of the white coat dinosaurs. Rather than humble themselves and admit that they aren't the bearers of all things knowledge and truth, many conventional doctors within the AMA have instead conspired to destroy the chiropractic profession, a mission that has since come back to bite them. As reported in a 1987 New York Times article, a group of chiropractors successfully sued the AMA for violating antitrust laws with its efforts to 'contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.' Judge Susan Getzendanner reportedly ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, agreeing that the AMA had unjustly labeled all chiropractors as 'unscientific cultists,' harming their practices and depriving chiropractors of normal association with medical physicians. The AMA had also, in Judge Getzendanner's judgment, injured the reputation of chiropractors with its 'name-calling practice.' 'There has never been an affirmative statement by the AMA that it is ethical to associate with chiropractors,' stated Judge Getzendanner at the time, rejecting false claims by the AMA and its associates that it had never intentionally gone against the chiropractic profession. Despite court conviction, AMA continues to illegally target chiropractic and other natural healing arts This major victory for chiropractic was significant at the time, but things have gotten worse in many ways since then with the further monopolization of medicine in the U.S. While so-called 'alternative' medicine -- that is, medicine that's not officially sanctioned by the legal drug cartels -- has continued to flourish all throughout the country, the AMA's conspiracy to conglomerate its power and influence whenever and wherever possible has also expanded. The eye-opening documentary film Doctored , which is now available for instant streaming through Amazon Prime, deals extensively with the medical profession's sordid history. Included in the film are revelations about how the AMA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and others have repeatedly conspired to destroy all forms of holistic care that don't involve the typical slash-and-burn, drug and vaccine 'treatments' dispensed by the establishment. Any segment of the medical community today that dares to tell people how the human body is fully capable of healing itself without pharmaceuticals or vaccines, for example, given that appropriate nutrition and other natural care is in place, is still generally ostracized by the mainstream medical profession and labeled 'quackery.' Nothing has really changed, as real healing practitioners must continue to defend themselves against the corporate sorceries that rule the day. 'Even with the success of the Wilkes Case and other anti-trust litigation, the AMA continues to this day to wage a campaign against chiropractic,' explains Your Medical Detective . 'Today, the attacks take the form of over-stated concerns for the safety of chiropractic health care.' AMA spends nearly $20 million annually lobbying Congress to uphold its medical monopoly Even though it officially disbanded its ridiculous 'Committee on Quackery' more than 40 years ago, the AMA hasn't given up on trying to destroy integrative physicians like chiropractors. Together with the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the AMA seeks to control medicine from the top down, much like a medical dictatorship. The AMA is the same group, after all, that has repeatedly pushed to keep mercury (thimerosal) in vaccines and paid off Congress to the tune of nearly $20 million a year in lobbying funds to maintain a monopoly over the medical profession. These three medical organizations also continue to use a certification program to control the medical market, barring integrative physicians like chiropractors from being certified, thus relegating them to second-tier status.

0," If you're one of the millions of people who have a love/hate relationship with Facebook, there are now even more reasons for hating the immensely successful social media giant. You probably know that Facebook collects and stores your personal data and preferences to form a profile that it uses to generate advertising content targeted directly at you. But did you know that Facebook also looks at all the other websites you visit and stores that data, too? Facebook also collects your online search data along with some of the details you give to retailers when you purchase something. Facebook and the data brokers Zuckerberg and his Facebook shareholders make huge amounts of money by partnering with what are known as 'data brokers.' Bruce Schneier, a data security expert, defines data brokers as entities which: 'collect demographic information: names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, presence and ages of children in household, education level, profession, income level, political affiliation, cars driven, and information about homes and other property. They collect lists of things you've purchased, when you've purchased them, and how you paid for them. They keep track of deaths, divorces, and diseases in your family. They collect everything about what you do on the Internet.' This information is used to target advertising to individuals, but many see it as an illegal invasion of privacy. One of the charges against Facebook is that it deliberately tries to hide the extent of its data mining. Very few people actually read the terms and conditions when they sign up to Facebook, and even those who do typically don't have a real understanding of what the privacy policies actually mean. A recent article posted by Phys.org explores the issue and observes: Users of social media are generally unaware of how much of their fragmented personal data is collated from across social media sites--and even taken from the content of their free, web-hosted emails (e.g. Gmail)--and how this can be used to build detailed personal profiles. 'Opting out' is difficult and basically futile Facebook claims that its users can opt out of its data-mining practices, but it's difficult to do so, and, according to data security experts, it doesn't make much difference if you do. As a piece on the Sherbit Blog points out: A 'note' on the 'Facebook and Privacy' page attempts to comfort users by insisting that 'the process is designed so that no personal information is exchanged between Facebook and marketers (or the third parties those marketers work with).' But the truth of the situation is that the 'data brokers' already own your personal information--and their collaboration with the social network may allow them to assemble even more detailed profiles of your health and habits in the future. The bottom line is that Facebook and the data brokers collect and store more personal information than the NSA does, and they make piles of money doing it. A recent analysis conducted by the Belgian Privacy Commission concluded that these practices are in violation of European law, but it remains to be seen whether or not anyone will be able to curtail Facebook's snooping practices. Facebook claims that its data-mining activities make for a better user experience, but I doubt that very many people actually appreciate their spying. 'Big Data' is increasingly expanding its reach into our personal lives, and it appears that the age of total online surveillance has arrived. What many of once thought of as a fun, essentially harmless and amazingly useful social network has turned into a intrusive tracking monster of Orwellian proportions. The NSA has nothing on Mark Zuckerberg and Co., and unless there is a concerted global effort to reverse the trend, we can expect the ever-increasing monitoring of every detail of our lives.

0," It started with chemicals like Agent Orange. When modern man bought into the idea of chemical warfare, he truly believed that he could poison his enemies and the environment to death and not face the repercussions. 19 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over 4.5 million acres in Vietnam as a way to defoliate the region and give American soldiers the upper hand in the jungle. Years later, returning US service personnel came back with tumors, birth defects, psychological problems and cancer. Agent Orange was a haunting preview of what chemicals would do to the world. A similar chemical approach is used for eradicating pests from the natural world. Chemicals like DDT were created in the laboratory and were used heavily for many years as pesticides against mosquitoes. Since these organochlorides are easily dissolved in fats or oils, they store readily in the tissues of animals and humans. Once inside the body, DDT disrupts cellular processes, causing liver cancer, neurological dysfunction and reproductive harm. Using DDT to eradicate disease-carrying mosquitoes only exacerbates widespread disease among the entire human race, since DDT lasts for several decades and bio-accumulates its way to the top of the food chain. In the farming fields, another method of chemical warfare was engineered to take out pests like the western corn rootworm. This pest feeds on corn and causes crop loss. To eradicate this pest, two strains of corn were spliced with different genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis : Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A. This splice gives the corn crops pesticidal properties; the corn is synthetically engineered to produce its own insecticide . However, the rootworms are now becoming increasingly resistant to this synthetic technology, and it's causing more harm than good. In the medicine world, antibiotics were created to kill bacteria on the spot. While this might be important in an absolute life or death scenario, the widespread use of these antibiotics has caused superbugs to evolve, creating bacteria strains that are more powerful and more deadly than ever before. Using chemical warfare to kill people, insects or disease is short-sighted and doesn't consider the consequences. As a long-term strategy, these chemical warfare methods are flagrantly ignorant and reap more widespread harm in the end. Malaria-carrying super mosquito discovered in Mali as chemical insecticides fail For the first time, scientists in Mali are discovering a class of super mosquitoes never seen before in nature. They have linked the super mosquitoes and their evolution to the widespread use of pyrethroids insecticides, which are typically used to treat mosquito nets in Africa. While the threat of malaria is dire, and while chemical insecticides may have helped keep the disease at bay by warding off mosquitoes, the approach is only causing increased resistance. 'Growing resistance has been observed for some time,' said lead researcher and medical entomologist Gregory Lanzaro from the University of California, Davis. 'Recently it has reached a level at some localities in Africa where it is resulting in the failure of the nets to provide meaningful control, and it is my opinion that this will increase.' The new super mosquito is very capable of carrying malaria. It is the result of interbreeding between two existing species of mosquito, both of which are striving to survive. Man-made changes to the mosquitoes' natural environment are altering their evolution, breaking down the 'reproductive isolation' that exists between two malaria-carrying mosquito species. This is causing a hybrid species of mosquito to develop. The gene-swapping technique is known as 'adaptive introgression' and it's the insecticide-treated nets that are speeding up the interbreeding. Malaria-carrying Anopheles gambiae is now mating with another marlaria-carrying species called Anopholes coluzzi , and the adaptive offspring may be harder to stop than their predecessors. We must return to nature for answers and balance The only effective long-term strategy for fighting pests and disease is to use the protective powers already existing and naturally evolving in nature. Chemicals speed up the evolutionary process, forcing pests and disease to build increased resistance, but nature's solutions, on the other hand, contain a myriad of pest-deterring compounds and disease-fighting intelligence that work in balance. That's why raw honey is far more effective as an antibacterial than prescription antibiotics. That's why essential oils like lemon eucalyptus and citronella are far more effective long-term strategies for ridding mosquitoes . In short, pests and disease build resistance to man-made chemicals. (Chemicals can only be effective for the general moment they were created in the evolutionary process). They won't work forever. Pests and disease are kept at bay more effectively by natural deterrents because both have existed in balance in nature throughout the entire evolutionary process.

0," Once again the corporate-owned, Left-wing mainstream media is serving as a Praetorian guard for President Barack Hussein Obama. In recent days The New York Times covered a rare visit by Obama to the National Counterterrorism Center, in which the paper initially published some very embarrassing comments the selfie-obsessed president made, but then memory-holed them later. As noted by The Federalist , the original story, written by reporters Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris and published Dec. 17, contained a stunning admission by the president following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. But by the next day Dec. 18 the embarrassing passage was removed. In a Twitter post, CNN 's Brian Stelter included the quote : In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. Republicans were telling Americans that he is not doing anything when he is doing a lot, he said. The first New York Times version confirmed a version of Obama that his critics have long suspected that when it comes to issues of national security , this president is an out-of-touch and disinterested bystander. 'Obama critics immediately pounced on the stunning admission from the president, expressing shock that he would claim that a lack of TV time was the real reason for him not understanding Americans' anxiety about terrorism,' The Federalist reported. Pathetic But then, The Times went into protection mode and removed the offending passage from its online version of the story, and that drew the attention of other journalists and Times watchers, who questioned the deletion. That wasn't all The Times did to protect Obama, however. In addition to deleting the embarrassing section, as tracked by Newsdiffs.org , Times editors changed the piece's headline on four separate occasions, each time putting Obama in a better light or portraying Republicans in a worse light. As reported by The Federalist : The original headline when the story was first published was 'Obama Visiting National Counterterrorism Center.' Less than two hours later, the headline was 'Obama, at Counterterrorism Center, Offers Assurances On Safety.' Then the headline was changed to 'Frustrated by Republican Critics, Obama Defends Muted Response to Attacks.' Two hours later, the headline was once again revised to 'Under Fire From G.O.P., Obama Defends Response to Terror Attacks.' The most recent headline revision, which accompanied the deletion of the passage where Obama admitted he didn't understand the American public's anxiety about terrorism, now reads, 'Assailed by G.O.P., Obama Defends His Response To Terror Attacks.' What's even more comical and pathetic is The Times ' reporters 'explanation' of what editors did, a sort of 'nothing to see here, just move on' response. Changes made no sense In a statement to the Washington Examiner 's T. Beckett Adams they responded: Thanks for the question. There's nothing unusual here. That paragraph, near the bottom of the story, was trimmed for space in the print paper by a copy editor in New York late last night. But it was in our story on the web all day and read by many thousands of readers. Web stories without length constraints are routinely edited for print. Sure. Why all the headline changes, then? Crickets. Silence. No response. As noted by Sean Davis of The Federalist , however, the changes made no sense. ' NYT says it 'trimmed' the Obama quote for space. It deleted 66 words and added 116 in that revision,' he said in one tweet. 'The NYT's excuse that it was just 'trimming for space' makes no sense. Its revision of that section added 50 words,' he said in another. The Times has been in the tank for Obama since he got the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. To expect the paper to now change the way it has protected him is ludicrous. But every time it does, the paper needs to be exposed for doing so.

0," Compared to land vegetables like broccoli and carrots, sea vegetables (edible seaweeds) receive relatively little attention in health food circles. This is unfortunate, for while sea vegetables are more difficult to purchase and incorporate into meals than land vegetables, they do boast one outstanding characteristic - their nutritional value has remained unchanged for centuries. Indeed, while the nutritiousness of regular fruits and vegetables continues to suffer due to ongoing soil erosion and environmental pollution, the average seaweed still contains over 70 minerals and phytonutrients. Despite their consistent nutritional profiles, however, not all sea vegetables are equal. The best of them rival the greatest soil-based superfoods, whereas others are less impressive and, in select cases, might even be detrimental for certain individuals to consume. Below is a list of the healthiest sea vegetables and their rejuvenating properties: Kelp Kelp is arguably the best-known sea vegetable, and for good reason - it's packed with more vitamins and trace minerals than probably any other seaweed. Aside from containing impressive quantities of vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K (effectively covering the entire vitamin spectrum), kelp is also loaded with protein, fiber, iodine, and sodium alginate, the latter being a chemical compound that helps remove radioactive particles from the body. Moreover, a regular consumption of kelp - preferably raw - has been linked to improved thyroid function and digestive health, and it is also an effective blood purifier and demulcent. Hijiki Trailing just behind kelp in the nutritional department is hijiki, another seaweed that contains just about every trace mineral our oceans can provide. Like kelp, hijiki also contains iodine, fiber, protein, sodium alginate, and vitamins A and B, albeit typically in lower quantities. One area in which hijiki excels, however, is its calcium content. In fact, hijiki contains more calcium than any other sea vegetable on Earth, making it an excellent bone-builder and protector against osteoporosis and other bone diseases. It also contains respectable levels of magnesium, phosphorous, iron, and potassium - important trace minerals that work in tandem to aid our bodies' natural processes. Kombu Beloved by the Japanese, kombu is an excellent 'all around' seaweed that contains robust quantities of almost of the major vitamins and minerals due to its high mineral salt content. Aside from being rich in vitamins B, C, D, and E, iodine, calcium, fiber, protein, iron, and potassium, kombu also contains a rare nutrient called germanium, which has excellent skin healing properties. Honorable mentions The following two seaweeds also deserve a mention in this list thanks to certain characteristics in their nutritional composition that set them apart from the rest of the crowd: Nori - Nori is comprised of between 30-50 percent protein, making it an excellent natural protein source for vegetarians and vegans. Agar - Although it doesn't compare to the brown seaweeds in nutritiousness, agar - a gelatinous matter that accumulates around the cell walls of red algae - is nonetheless an ideal weight loss food. Since it is comprised of approximately 80 percent fiber, agar swells in the stomach due to water absorption, thereby inducing a feeling of fullness that discourages overeating. It also contains no sugar or fat, and only 14 calories per tablespoon. Therefore, if you're seeking a healthy dessert that won't compromise your weight loss plans, consider purchasing some agar jellies. "
0," Corporate and government vaccine pushers are increasingly using the nation's public schools to spread propaganda, but parents in many areas are pushing back against the onslaught. As reported by The Daily Sheeple , one of the site's readers recently submitted some actual homework assignments -- which allegedly came from an elementary school that was not identified -- titled 'Medicine.' The documents attempt to indoctrinate young students into believing that vaccines (and with them prescription drugs) are the primary route to overall health, if not the only route. The papers appear to convey a message that, without them, society would experience a major lack of health . As The Daily Sheeple 's Heather Callaghan further notes: Sadly, this is not for Health Class! Like so many other assignments we've seen, this is for a staple class (the three Rs) but produces propaganda about an unrelated topic. We've seen this happen for math classes in story problems. In the upper right corner is the word 'comprehension' indicating that this is from Reading class. Also, Callaghan noted that the classwork papers were not actually brand-new; they were copyrighted 1995. Please don't send home propaganda The child's parent, however, appeared to be having none of it; the parent X'ed out the entire assignment but wrote a comment that left nothing to the imagination: Please send home different work! I have decided to not have [ the student ] do this homework and will ask to not have her do school or home work on drugs and shots!! This is a serious and complicated issue that should be between [ her ] parents and her healthcare provider. At her age, she cannot make informed decisions about the risks. This appears to be propaganda! Thank you An explanatory paragraph on the assignment embraces the notion that vaccines are vitally necessary for a healthy lifestyle. The paper suggests that, by taking them, students will never contract measles, mumps and other contagious childhood diseases (which is false; even vaccinated children contract and spread these diseases). On the worksheet, for example, question No. 4 asks the student to identify a word 'that means 'medicine that that keeps you healthy'' -- with the 'correct' answer being 'vaccine.' At the end of the paper is an open-ended question that seeks to find out how the child will respond to a question along the lines of whether vaccines are the same as taking care of yourself properly and will always prevent disease. Overall, it is a comprehension assignment -- in that the child is intended to comprehend the vaccine propaganda and medical dogma being offered so he or she can repeat it back to the teacher. The implications, of course, are very real: If children are indoctrinated to unquestionably accept vaccination, it will be much easier for Big Pharma and Big Government to push vaccines as the 'best way to good health,' despite evidence that vaccines can and do cause injury. Even Sesame Street is getting into the act. In this YouTube video , the character Elmo is pushing vaccines with U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. They're going after our kids Elmo is at the doctor's office and is 'worried' about 'getting a shot' -- a 'vac-cin-na-tion,' he sounds out -- and he wonders why 'everyone needs to' get them. Murthy then proceeds to ask Elmo some comparative questions: Do you carry an umbrella when it rains? Of course, says Elmo. Do you wear a helmet when you ride a tricycle? Of course, responds Elmo -- doesn't everybody? Just like an umbrella protects you from the rain, and a helmet protects you from hitting your head, a vaccine protects you from germs. Murthy then says, 'Your body can protect you from germs,' to which Elmo responds, 'Oh, good! Then Elmo doesn't need a vaccination!' Hold on there, says Murthy. Vaccines are necessary! See the video here . The vaccine pushers have decided that, in order to dispel any argument over vaccine dangers, they are going after our children early and often. Like good propagandists.

0," Gluten is found in grains such as wheat, semolina, kamut, barley, spelt, triticale, bulgur and rye and forms an elastic-type protein that helps bind molecules, causing flours to rise during baking. Its presence in certain flours contributes to a delicious, chewy bagel or bread dough; however, it is also an allergen for many people. Reactions to eating gluten may appear immediately or hours and days later. Gluten intolerance can cause serious autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac and Crohn's disease as well as a multitude of other symptoms ranging from irritable bowl syndrome to skin rashes and headaches. Most problems can be prevented by avoiding those foods and adhering to a gluten-free diet. The idea of giving up wheat -- the most commonly used flour for almost all commercial baked goods, pastas and cereals -- may be challenging and feel overwhelming at first. However, there are many new gluten-free products available and bakeries are producing more and more gluten-free recipes due to the high demand. 1. Grains Certain grains should be avoided to prevent reactions to gluten, according to guidelines provided by Rush University Medical Center. All foods containing the grains mentioned above including but not limited to bread, pasta, cereals, muffins, bagels, cookies, cakes, gravies, croutons, bread crumbs, biscuits, rolls, pita, batter-fried foods, noodles, wheat-based tortillas, ice cream cones, bran, wheat germ, dumplings, pancake mixes, pies, pumpernickel and rye breads, cornbread, vermicelli, doughnuts, buns, pretzels, spaghetti, waffles and pastries, should be avoided unless the label states clearly that they are gluten-free. Many of these foods can be substituted with similar gluten-free products available in most health food and grocery stores. 2. Condiments and Seasonings Many common condiments and seasonings contain gluten and cause problems for those who are gluten-intolerant. The following foods should be eliminated from the diet unless they plainly state on the label that they are gluten-free: Worcestershire sauce, MSG, modified food starch, malt products, bouillon, barley malt, soy sauce and any salad dressings or gravies thickened with wheat or other gluten-based flour. 3. Alcoholic Beverages Eliminate certain alcoholic drinks like beer, ale, light beer and hard liquors made with grains containing gluten. For anyone newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance ,it's recommended that youproceed cautiously to determine if you can tolerate alcoholic drinks distilled from gluten grains, which include most gin, whiskey and some vodkas. 4. Processed Meats The Celiac Sprue Association recommends eliminating all processed meats from the diet. Sprue is one form of debilitating arthritis accompanied by a wealth of digestive symptoms and is caused by eating gluten . Along with having cancer-causing chemicals in them, almost all processed meats including cold cuts, liverwurst, hot dogs, sausages, bologna, pepperoni, salami and pate are high in gluten because various grains are used in their manufacture. 5. Sweets and Treats Being on a gluten-free diet includes eliminating sweets and treats that may be made with flours and other substances containing gluten. Foods to avoid include all products made with malt, all chocolate and chocolate candy containing malt, ice cream, candies containing cereal extract, sherbets, commercial cake frosting, and root beer. Check labels and look for products that are specifically labeled gluten-free. Cross Contamination According to the Mayo Clinic, when a variety of gluten-free products come into contact with products such as grains containing gluten, cross-contamination may occur. This is common in factories that process both regular and gluten-free products and use the same machines for both. The other place cross-contamination can occur is in the kitchen. It occurs most commonly when preparing meals and sharing the same kitchen tools and surfaces. Use extreme care and have a back up cutting board that is only used for preparing gluten-free items to avoid cross-contamination. "
0," Most scientists would state categorically that homeopathy is a scientific impossibility. Who would disagree, as the explanation that is currently provided to support homeopathy makes very little sense. How is it possible that a solution that contains no chemical atoms causes a biological reaction? All of our basic understanding of science screams out that this is patently impossible. But what if all that we have been taught at school, at university and at work is in fact only part of the truth. What if there was a missing part of our education that provides the missing link that makes subjects such as homeopathy scientifically obvious. What if there is much more to our body than simply chemicals. It took me two years of research to uncover this hidden area of science. Once I did, the scientific explanation for many controversial areas of science, including homeopathy, became uncontroversial. What I am about to teach you about homeopathy is just one of the many areas of science that have been hidden from us which are finally exposed in my book, Blinded by Science www.blindedbyscience.co.uk If we look at homeopathy from a completely different area of science other than chemistry then we can begin to understand how homeopathy really works. It is just like one of those intellectual games that people play, where the answer is so obvious once you know it, but impossible if you don't Take the following puzzle: You are in front of three light switches only one of which turns on a light in the adjacent room. You only have two attempts to find out which of the three switches work. Without being able to see the effect of the switches it is impossible to know which of them work, it is a mathematical impossibility. However, by using a different area of science , the solution is incredibly simple. The answer lies with the heat generated from the light and not the light itself. If you turn on a switch and then turn it off again and go and feel if the light is hotter then in two attempts you will know exactly which of the light switches turns on the light. Now if we turn back to homeopathy , we have to look at it from the same idea and say that the idea that chemicals are the issue is irrelevant to solving the problem. It is not the chemicals in the solution that cause a biological change but the vibrations that emanated from the chemicals, which have an affect. The massive missing part of our education is simply the concept of 'vibrations' and everything that they affect. In the puzzle above, the light caused the bulb to heat up through vibrations and so two ideas were working at the same time, light and heat. The same is true with every aspect of our body, it works on two levels, a chemical one and a vibrational one, they go hand in hand, one does not work without the other. As every electron vibrates uniquely and everything is made up of electrons then it is incontrovertible to state that everything vibrates, absolutely everything. So if everything vibrates, it would seem fairly logical that one vibration must affect another. Just take sound as an example, a choir all singing together sounds very different from a school playground. The same thing happens in our body, you get choirs in parts of our body where it is healthy vibrationally and noisy playgrounds where our body's organs are malfunctioning causing vibrational disharmony and sickness. This idea is hugely controversial as it contradicts everything that we have been taught. The tragedy however, is that science has proven it to be true in thousands of different studies, but has not promoted is as it implies that pharmaceutical drugs are not the only cure in town. So if vibrations are the answer what about the big idea that is put forward by homeopaths that is it also to do with the concept that water has some sort of a memory to provide evidence that homeopathy works scientifically. This is total nonsense and provides yet more ammunition to everyone who wants to dismiss a perfectly sensible area of science as pseudo-science. WATER DOES NOT HAVE A MEMORY. Of course it doesn't. Water has amazing functions but memory is not one of them. Water has the amazing property that enables it to change its vibrational pattern to the chemical or environment in which it is in. This is an incredibly important point and one that needs to be remembered, water is a chameleon, adapting itself to its environment vibrationally. As an example, in one experiment, if you treated a cup of water with a specific vibrational frequency the water would change itself to that specific vibration and it would stay like that forever. It would only change if it came across a different vibration. This vibrated water if ingested directly and instantly affects our body's biological functions. Depending on the vibrational frequency of the water, different illnesses can be treated. I have not included the specific scientific experiments here that prove all of the ideas I have outlined, but you can look them up for free on my website at www.blindedbyscience.co.uk in the bibliography section on the website. The conclusion from my research is that if you add a chemical into a solution and then remove all traces of that chemical from the solution, the specific chemical vibrational remains which has the same biological affect as if the chemical were still in the water. The body recognises the new vibration and reacts accordingly. This idea has radical implications for our health as it means that not only do we have to question the water that we drink but also our environment in which we live which is saturated with man made vibrations from all of the electronic machinery that we use in our every day lives. What damage are they in fact doing to our health? So hopefully, in these few paragraphs I have shown that it is scientifically logical for homeopathic treatments to work, through the properties of vibrations. The problem that I have, however, is this: how do homeopathic treatments work when they are in solid pill form. For this I do not have the answers. I can only confirm that homeopathy is a very simple science in principle when it is in a solution and should be embraced by the scientific community.

0," The Centers for Disease Control announced on Feb. 1 that the Chipotle Mexican Grill E. coli outbreak is officially over. The outbreak, which triggered allegations of bioterrorism and corporate sabotage, has apparently been contained after making scores of people in more than a dozen states sick. From CNBC: 'Two separate outbreaks of the bacteria were investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service and public health officials in several states. 'In the first outbreak 55 people were infected by the foodborne illness in 11 states, of which 21 were hospitalized. The second, smaller outbreak, infected five people from three states, of which one was hospitalized.' Chipotle hopes to regain the confidence of consumers and investors after sales dropped 30 percent late last year, following six separate outbreaks of E. coli , norovirus and Salmonella , which have been linked to the chain's restaurants. Suspicions aroused Many observers familiar with the biotech industry's dirty tricks became suspicious about the outbreaks partly because Chipotle is the only fast food chain in America which has publicly denounced the GMO industry and pledged to serve only non-GMO ingredients, but also because some of the disease strains involved were extremely rare and likely developed in laboratories before being introduced into the restaurant chain's food supply by corporate saboteurs. One of those who sounded the alarm is selfnews founder Mike Adams, the Health Ranger , who wrote in December, 2015: 'As a clean food advocate myself, I know firsthand of the malicious tactics used by these biotech mafia operations, including tactics of intimidation and terrorism, such as calling in bomb threats to locations where clean food activists are about to speak. 'There is absolutely no question that the biotech industry will resort to ANY activity necessary to destroy food companies that oppose GMOs. And yes, this includes acts of bioterrorism against Chipotle -- something that's ridiculously easy for biotech industry operatives to carry out with simple, low-cost laboratory supplies sold online at places like Amazon.com.' Adams has publicly urged Chipotle to initiate a criminal investigation to uncover the truth regarding the possible bioterrorism attacks on its restaurants by GMO industry goons . The Health Ranger is not the only person asking questions and urging authorities to investigate the matter more thoroughly. Experts at a loss to explain 'unusual' outbreak Even mainstream news sources trying to downplay the conspiracy angle admit that the 'unusual' outbreak has baffled experts. As reported by Business Insider : 'The first reports of E. coli sickening Chipotle customers were revealed in October. Three months and thousands of tests later, health investigators still can't find the source of the outbreak, which has since sickened 53 people in nine states. 'That's unusual, according to several food-contamination experts. In five similar high-profile cases of major foodborne-illness outbreaks over the last couple decades, the source of the outbreaks was determined relatively quickly, according to a Credit Suisse analysis. 'On top of investigations by state and local health officials, Chipotle has done hundreds of internal tests on its food and surfaces without finding a trace of E. coli.' Another Business Insider article acknowledging the corporate sabotage theory revealed that many social network users agreed with Adams, saying they were also suspicious from the moment they heard the reports of the outbreaks. One such comment was from Facebook user Karen Conklin, who wrote: 'I said that to my husband, I knew that Big Ag was behind it! You don't get e-coli in organic foods. Chipotle said they couldn't find anything in the food. Very suspicious!' Mike Adams wrote: 'This act of bioterrorism is entirely consistent with the known behavior patterns of the biotech industry.' Based on its history of attacking clean food activists such as Dr. Oz , not to mention tireless (and often illegal) lobbying efforts along with 'intense campaigns of defamation, slander, intimidation and threats,' it's not much of a leap to begin suspecting the biotech industry's involvement in the Chipotle food contamination scandal.

0," Although prescription drug abuse among both children and adults now rivals illegal street drugs in both prevalence and lethality, most parents are not particularly concerned about such abuse among children and teenagers, according to the most recent University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health. In addition, parental support is weak for many proposed policies that could help restrict access to commonly abused narcotic painkillers like Oxcycontin or Vicodin. 'This is a national problem and a growing problem,' researcher Sarah J. Clark said. 'The results of this poll are a signal that parents may not be aware of the significant rates of misuse of narcotic pain medicine, which highlights the tremendous challenge of addressing this national problem.' Only 35 percent of parents said that they were 'very concerned' about the misuse of narcotic painkillers (opioids) by children and teenagers in their own communities. Even fewer - 19 percent - were very concerned about the misuse of such drugs in their own families. Strikingly, white parents had the lowest rates of concern (13 percent) about abuse in their families, compared with Hispanic (26 percent) or black (38 percent parents), even though painkiller abuse is three times higher among white teenagers than among black or Hispanic teenagers. White parents were also significantly less likely than black or Hispanic parents to support policies that would limit children's access to prescription painkillers. Parents underestimate seriousness of problem Recent studies have shown that more overdose deaths are caused by narcotic painkillers than by cocaine and heroin combined. Nationwide, rates of prescription drug abuse now equal or outstrip those of all illegal street drugs combined. In addition, studies have shown that 75 percent of narcotic painkiller abusers obtain the drugs from someone with a valid prescription - typically either themselves, a friend or a relative. The new poll confirmed the ease with which children and teenagers can obtain such drugs: 35 percent of parents said that they had received at least one pain drug for their children in the past five years, with half of these being narcotics. 66 percent of parents had received a prescription painkiller for at least one household adult in the past five years. Yet, nearly 50 percent of parents surveyed said they did not support requirements that people return unused pain drugs to a doctor or pharmacy, and 59 percent did not favor a requirement that painkiller prescription refills be obtained only from a doctor's office. 66 percent of parents did support laws that would require parents to show identification before purchasing a narcotic painkiller for a child, while 57 percent supported regulations prohibiting people from obtaining a narcotic painkiller prescription from more than one doctor. But in general, the researchers noted, the parental responses indicated a low level of concern about the problem. 'Recent estimates are that one in four high school seniors have ever used a narcotic pain medicine. However, parents may downplay the risks of narcotic pain medicine because they are prescribed by a doctor,' Clark said.

0," The Food and Drug Administration approved a new flu shot in January 2013 called Flublok. With the CDC calling claiming the flu is 'at an epidemic level, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises American to get the a flu shot.' Flublok, made by Protein Sciences Corp., of Meriden, Connecticut, will be readily available for the 2013-2014 flu season. Natural remedies to build immunity still continue to be the best protection. Add vitamin D to your diet - see sources below for herbal and vitamin remedies to prevent and treat the flu. What is Flublok? The makers claim that this new vaccine has advantages over the old flu vaccine. The vaccine can be made very quickly, and this is seen as an advantage in case of an epidemic. The reason the vaccine can be made quickly is that Flublok does not need to be grown in chicken eggs as most other vaccines are. The current vaccine has been shown to only be 16 to 63 percent effective against the flu. Flublok contains three times the active ingredients in the regular flu shot, but no egg, so it is safer for those with egg allergies. It also contains no adjuvants or mercury, i.e. Thimerosol. While the elimination of egg and the elimination of mercury (themerisol) from the vaccine is good news for health advocates, many questions remain. For instance, Flublok is made in cells of insects grown in steel tanks.There is no research or information about possible problems this new technology could cause for humans. Ingredients in Flublok The influenza virus protein in Flublok, or hemagglutinin (HA), is manufactured in a lab, inside the cells of insects in steel tanks. This hemagglutinin (HA) is the same HA protein molecule that has been created for use in previous flu vaccines. However, Flublok contains this 'insect cell' version of HA rather than the type made with eggs. The director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Karen Midthun, M.D states: 'The new technology offers the potential for faster start-up of the vaccine manufacturing process in the event of a pandemic, because it is not dependent on an egg supply or on availability of the influenza virus.' According to the FDA, 'Flublok contains three, full-length, recombinant HA proteins to help protect against two influenza virus A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, and one influenza virus B strain.' In the research phase of this new drug, half of the 4,600 research subjects received Flublok and the other half, placebo. The tests showed 44.6 percent effectiveness of the Flublok. In tests with 195 participants, Flublock showed increased seroprotection rates, proposing that the higher rates of seroprotection would lead to higher immunity but that was only theorized.

0," British registered company, GlaxoSmithKline, faces $3 billion in penalties after pleading guilty to the biggest health care fraud case in history. GSK admitted that physicians had been bribed to push potentially dangerous drugs in exchange for Madonna tickets, Hawaiian holidays, cash and lucrative speaking tours. They also admitted distributing misleading information regarding the antidepressant Paxil. The report claimed that it was suitable for children, but failed to acknowledge data from studies proving its ineffectiveness in children and adolescents. GSK faced charges that they had used the gifts to sell three drugs that were either unsafe, or used for purposes that were not approved. The first drug, Paxil also known as Seroxat, was touted as safe and effective for children and adolescents. The ineffectiveness of Paxil, and the link to suicides, meant that it was banned for kids under 18-years-olds in 2008. The second drug, Avandia was used in Britain to treat diabetes until it was withdrawn due to safety fears, including increased risk of heart attacks. The US government claimed that GSK had attempted to conceal the data surrounding the dangers. The third drug, Wellbrutin is used in the UK for treating depression, but it was alleged that GSK had recommended physicians used it for ADHD, lost libido and as a slimming aid. None of which were approved uses for the drug. The moral code of Big Pharma companies exposed Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK said 'Whilst these offenses originate in a different era for the company, they cannot and will not be ignored. On behalf of GSK , I want to express our regret and reiterate that we have learned from the mistakes that were made. We are deeply committed to doing everything we can to live up to and exceed the expectations of those we work with and serve. In the US, we have taken action at all levels in the company. We have fundamentally changed our procedures for compliance, marketing and selling.' US attorney for Massachusetts, Carmen Ortiz said: 'The GSK sales force bribed physicians to prescribe GSK products using every imaginable form of high priced entertainment, from Hawaiian vacations to paying doctors millions of dollars to go on speaking tours, to a European pheasant hunt, to tickets to Madonna concerts.' This is the biggest settlement in the history of drug industries, ahead of the 2009 Pfizer case in which it was fined $2.2 billion for promoting four drugs for unapproved uses. In 2010, GSK paid $96 million to a whistle-blower who exposed contamination problems and a management cover up in Puerto Rico. The practice of pushing drugs for unapproved uses is endemic within the drug industries. Two of the largest drug companies have been caught and fined huge amounts for chasing sales targets using any means necessary. It proves that the health of customers, even children, ranks lower on the companies' agenda than profit. Using bribes to get doctors to prescribe drugs shows a complete lack of moral fiber from both sales teams and the doctors. After this case, surely the doctors also need to face the courts for their conduct. Whilst the amounts of money seem to be a huge punishment for GSK, the settlement is merely a slap on the wrist for a company whose market value is $133 billion. Can we trust another multinational that promises to clean up its act, when others have promised the same, only to behave just as recklessly but much more surreptitiously. "
0," Schizophrenia is a disabling brain disorder characterized by the inability to tell reality from imagination, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Symptoms are broken down into two types called 'positive symptoms,' which include hallucinations and delusions, and 'negative symptoms' which include social withdrawal, apathy, and a lack of emotional expressiveness. While drugs have been found to help many with the positive type of symptoms, too often there's no help for the negative variety - until now. A new study has found that taking dietary supplements folate and vitamin B12 can alleviate these symptoms in some patients . In a new placebo-controlled study of 140 patients with schizophrenia, a research team based at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) found improvement across all participants when folate and B12 were added to their regular treatments. But the results were most significant in those carrying specific variants in genes involved with folate metabolism. The report has just been published in JAMA Psychiatry (formerly Archives of General Psychiatry ) online. It's the first study designed specifically to investigate whether supplementation with folate and B12 (which increases the effects of folate) can treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. 'The symptoms of schizophrenia are complex, and antipsychotic medications provide no relief for some of the most disabling parts of the illness. These include negative symptoms , which can be particularly devastating,' Joshua Roffman, MD, MMSc, of the MGH Department of Psychiatry, corresponding author of the JAMA Psychiatry paper, said in a media statement. 'Our finding that folate plus vitamin B12 supplementation can improve negative symptoms opens a new potential avenue for treatment of schizophrenia. Because treatment effects differed based on which genetic variants were present in each participant, the results also support a personalized medical approach to treating schizophrenia.' So why would the essential nutrient folate (often found in supplements in the folic acid form) have a positive impact on the devastating condition known as schizophrenia? In their paper, the researchers note that folate is necessary for the synthesis of DNA and neurotransmitters and it plays a role in the control of gene expression. Previous studies have linked folate deficiency during pregnancy with an increased risk of schizophrenia among offspring. Earlier research by members of the MGH-based team found low blood folate levels were associated with the more severe, negative symptoms among patients with schizophrenia. 'Folate plays a critical role in DNA methylation, which regulates gene expression, so it's plausible that its effects on negative symptoms act through gene expression changes,' Dr. Roffman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , explained in a media statement. 'Participants with the low-functioning FOLH1 variant (a gene involved in folate metabolism) might eventually show a benefit of folate supplementation if treated for a longer period of time, but that needs to be investigated in future studies.' 'Understanding more about the basic neural mechanisms of folate in patients with schizophrenia could help us generate more targeted and effective interventions to reduce and possibly even prevent symptoms.'

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Malnutrition shaves as much as three percent off the production of some of the poorest countries in the world, but obesity could soon affect economic output as severely as malnutrition, according to findings from the World Bank as of this week. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity has tripled in the past twenty years and in addition, 10 percent of children and 20 percent of adults will be obese in Europe and Central Asia by the year 2010 unless some kind of action is taken. Dr. Meera Shekar -- senior nutrition specialist with the World Bank -- said that malnutrition cuts two to three percent off of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the hardest-hit countries -- and the growing rate of obesity could do the same. Dr. Shekar says 'We suspect that these estimates will be just as high' for obesity. Six percent of health costs in the WHO's European region already comes from obesity in adults. For example, obesity cost France $6.41 billion in direct costs alone in 2002, while cost the state of California $22 billion in the year 2000, including indirect costs. As obesity is also expected to reduce life expectancy, it could have a direct impact on the global economy as well. A recent study in Britain forecasted that men would live five years less by 2050 if current trends were not reversed regarding the global obesity problem. Dr. Shekar said, 'The important thing is that because the problem is increasing we would see an increasing drain on economies, particularly developing economies,' while adding that obesity had appeared recently in the Middle East and North Africa -- and was turning out to be a big problem in Latin America. The prevalence of obesity seems to shift to the poor from the rich in developing countries -- and this has happened in France, where obesity is five times more prevalent among low-income groups than high earners according to WHO Regional Adviser Dr. Franceso Branca. ### "
0," Along with spinach and kale, broccoli is one of the most nutritious 'regular' vegetables in existence. Indeed, this cruciferous, cabbage-like vegetable, which was first grown in the Italian province of Campania, was seen as uniquely valuable among the Ancient Romans due to its significant healing properties. When Italian immigrants introduced broccoli to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, it became a favorite vegetable among the settlers, and its popularity continues to grow today. In fact, broccoli consumption has increased over 940 percent in the West in the last 25 years -- possibly because an ever-increasing number of studies show just how good it is for us.(1) Contains cancer-fighting isothiocyanates Research has shown that broccoli is effective at preventing and treating several types of cancer. For example, a review published in Recent Patents on Endocrine Metabolic & Immune Drug Discovery in 2013 concluded that cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli exhibited anti-tumor activity. The researchers also noted that the isothiocyanates in broccoli, which are known antioxidants, could 'inhibit the cell viability of human cervical cancer cells, human pancreatic cancer cells, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, human ovarian cancer cells, and have anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of human T-cell leukemia cells.'(2) Another review published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention in 2013 also ascribed broccoli's anti-cancer benefits to its concentrations of isothiocyanates, though the researchers admitted that the chemopreventive effect of these compounds are not yet fully understood.(3) Packed with vitamins C and K One cup of chopped broccoli provides us with 135 percent of our recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin C and 116 percent of our RDA of vitamin K.(4) Aside from being a powerful antioxidant that helps scavenge cell-damaging free radicals from the body, vitamin C also aids the synthesis of collagen (an essential part of our connective tissue), thereby providing us with anti-aging benefits. Vitamin K, on the other hand, aids blood clot formation and helps maintain bone health. Without adequate amounts of vitamin K in our diets, we can suffer from excessive bleeding and, in the worst cases, bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Provides protection from environmental toxins A study published in Clinical Immunology in March 2009 found that sulforaphane -- a molecule found within isothiocyanates -- can protect us from respiratory inflammation that leads to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other common respiratory conditions. According to the study, the sulforaphane increased the production of antioxidant enzymes in human subjects, thereby guarding them from excessive free radical exposure associated with inhaling polluted air, vehicle fumes and cigarette smoke.(5) These results suggest that regular consumption of broccoli -- which is one of the greatest natural sources of sulforaphane -- can help protect us from environmental toxins. Rich in fiber and additional nutrients Broccoli is also high in many other health-boosting nutrients. Firstly, one cup of chopped broccoli supplies us with 9 percent of our RDA of dietary fiber, which helps to sweep the colon of accumulated waste, promote regularity and absorb sugar from the intestinal tract. Secondly, broccoli is packed with essential minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, selenium and potassium, which work in tandem to aid our bodies' natural processes. Thirdly, broccoli is rich in vitamin A, which helps maintain vision. It is also a fantastic weight loss food, since it contains minimal calories and fat, and possesses a virtually non-existent glycemic load.(4) According to the Linus Pauling Institute , broccoli is best consumed raw since heat interferes with the enzyme that releases isothiocyanates, limiting the number of them that our bodies can absorb.(6) "
0," Despite the fact that Fukushima is already the worst radiological disaster in human history -- and worsening by the day -- Japan has been chosen as the host nation for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Hilariously, the event is being billed the 'Safe Games' of 2020. How, exactly, is it safe to host the Olympics in a nation which absolutely no workable evacuation routes from a nuclear facility on the verge of collapsing into another deadly radiation release? The answer to that question is provided by Japan's Prime Minister Abe. He claims that Fukushima is no problem whatsoever, that no one has ever been harmed by it, and that it is fully under control! (A trifecta, he thinks...) 'Some may have concerns about Fukushima. Let me assure you the situation is under control. It has never done and will never do any damage to Tokyo. It poses no problem whatsoever. There are no health related problems until now, nor will there be in the future. I make the statement to you in the most emphatic and unequivocal way.' - Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan Drinking beer makes you immune to radiation? If this sounds familiar, that's because it mirrors the propaganda disinfo campaign funded by the Japanese government to claim radiation would not hurt you if you just drank a few beers or smiled a lot. It's true. As reported here at selfnews , Dr. Yamashita was hired by the Japanese government to try to brainwash people into thinking happiness made you immune to radiation poisoning. (This man is now referred to as 'Dr. Fullashita' by English speakers.) On behalf of the Japanese government, his claims include these bizarre, pseudoscientific statements: 'To tell you the truth, radiation doesn't affect people who are smiling. Only those who are worried. This has clearly been demonstrated by animal studies.' 'Drinking may be bad for your health, but happy drinkers are less affected by radiation.' 'If you laugh, radiation won't get you.' 'Adults over 20 years have very little sensitivity to radiation. Almost zero.' 'Not a problem if you continue to live here. Just wash your vegetables, that's all.' 'We don't have to worry about the health effects of ordinary people.' Read more quotes from Dr. Fullashita at: http://www.selfnews.com/041720_fukushima_... Maybe the Olympic athletes will have extra 'energy!' Over a century ago, at the dawn of the age of elemental discovery, mainstream scientists believed radioactive elements such as radium provided extra 'energy' to the human body. Doctors prescribed radiation pills to patients, right alongside mercury pills for digestive disorders. This was all considered state-of-the-art conventional medicine, and anyone who tried to point out that radiation was bad for you or that mercury was toxic was immediately branded a quack and ridiculed by the 'scientific' establishment. (Today, the same treatment is delivered to anyone who questions the safety of mercury in vaccines, chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer.) As you might have guessed, nearly all the scientists and doctors who dealt in these radiation pills ended up dying of cancer themselves. Some of them never figured out why, either, believing in the arrogance of their 'scientific' theories to their dying day. The ghosts of those dead scientists would be thrilled, no doubt, to learn that Japan is going to host the 2020 Summer Olympics right next to the world's most dangerous, out-of-control radiation zone. As the half-life of uranium isotopes used for nuclear fuel is roughly about five billion years , there should still be plenty of radiation left for the 2020 Olympics, too. Maybe the 2020 Summer Olympics will be the first sporting event in the world where the athletes demand to wear respirators during the competition, setting new records for the slowest times ever recorded. A 12-second 100 meter? Japan cannot be evacuated The fact that the Olympic committee chose Japan even while Fukushima rages on, just one earthquake away from a catastrophic collapse and unprecedented release of deadly radiation, tells you just how incredibly stupid the Olympics decision makers really are. (Or how paid off they are, as bribes and corruption have been well documented throughout the history of the Olympics). Do these people not grasp even the most fundamental concepts of physics? Why would any sane organization vote to host a global event that brings hundreds of thousands of people to a location just a short distance away from a collapsing nuclear power plant that is utterly and completely out of control with no end in sight? Furthermore, Japan has no workable evacuation plan if Fukushima's reactor #4 does experience a structural collapse followed by a catastrophic release of radiation. There is no evacuation plan because Japan cannot be evacuated, period. Thus, the strategy of the Japanese government has become one of D-E-N-I-A-L instead of problem solving. Let's all pretend radiation is no longer a problem, shall we? Japan is pretending. The U.S. is pretending, and now the Olympic committee is pretending, too. As long as they're pretending, why not host the Olympics at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power facility? It's available, after all. And the rent is dirt cheap.

0," A Texas based healthcare company has been accused of expediting the deaths of hospice patients via drug overdoses in order to increase profits, according to a report by NBC 5 . Brad Harris, 34, founded Novus Health Care Services, Inc. in July 2012, state records show. The company is based in Frisco. Individuals employed with Novus accuse Harris of making heartless comments about hospice patients living too long. He allegedly instructed nurses to speed up their death by doubling, tripling and quadrupling their medication. Harris, an accountant with no medical background, reportedly 'instructed a nurse to administer overdoses to three patients and directed another employee to increase a patient's medication to four-times the maximum allowed,' the FBI wrote in an affidavit for a search warrant obtained by the local news. 'Hastening the death' of hospice patients 'You need to make this patient go bye-bye,' Harris allegedly wrote in a text sent to a nurse employed with Novus. In the first instance, the nurse refused her boss's instructions, but the FBI affidavit is unclear as to whether or not any hospice patients were harmed by Harris' lethal business model. Apparently, healthcare providers have an incentive to get rid of patients fast because they do not 'make more money for longer hospice stays,' reports NBC 5 . According to the FBI , hospices are subject to an 'aggregator cap,' which limits Medicare and Medicaid payments based on the average annual hospice stay. Providers can be forced to pay back money to the government if ' patients live too long. ... Hence, hospice providers have an incentive to enroll patients whose hospice stays will be short relative to the cap,' said the FBI. Novus first attracted the attention of the FBI in 2014, when information surfaced that the company was recruiting patients 'who did not qualify for services,' fraudulently billing the government for unnecessary medical treatments. It was during the investigation that the FBI learned of Harris' much more sinister behavior, including that 'as part of this scheme, Harris, who has no medical training or licenses, would direct his employed nurses to overdose hospice patients with palliative medications such as morphine to hasten death, and thereby minimize Novus' (paybacks) under the cap.' Healthcare fraud, false statements and obstructing an investigation The FBI raided the offices of the healthcare provider in September 2015, but NBC 5 was unable to view court records pertaining to that search, because they appear to be sealed. Determined to increase profits, Harris handpicked which home healthcare patients would be moved to hospice, completely ignoring their medical needs. 'He did this by having employees who were not doctors sign the certifications with the names of doctors also employed by Novus ,' wrote the FBI agent. 'If a patient was on hospice care for too long, Harris would direct the patient be moved back to home health, irrespective of whether the patient needed continued hospice care.' Harris is reported to have made a series of cold-hearted and arguably downright evil comments to the nurses he employed about killing off hospice patients. During a lunch meeting, he told two healthcare executives to 'find patients who would die within 24 hours,' in order to 'save my ass toward the cap,' according to the FBI. Referring to a current hospice patient , Harris said that he wished they 'would just [expletive] die.' He allegedly directed other employees to 'overdose hospice patients when they have been on hospice service for too long.' The FBI is investigating Novus for healthcare fraud , false statements relating to healthcare matters, and obstruction of a criminal investigation into healthcare offenses. The company was forced to turn over all of its data storage including emails, medical records and passwords. Novus' website says: 'When you invite us into your home, it's personal.

However, the researchers may be a few hundred years late with their discovery since onion juice has been used as a remedy for thin and greying hair for ages. What the researchers found was that grey hair is primarily caused by a buildup of hydrogen peroxide at the root of hair follicles and that this was due in great part to a reduction in the natural antioxidant compound catalase. In addition to helping cleanse the scalp and follicles, onion juice also promotes the production of catalase. Catalase prevents grey hair as well as promoted thicker hair follicles. The researchers 'new' breakthrough appears to be the rediscovery of a remedy for grey hair and baldness that herbalists have known for centuries: Onion juice. Hundreds of years ago, famed herbalist John Gerard (1545- 1612) wrote: 'the juyce of onions annointed upon a bald head in the sun bringeth the hair againe very speedily.' Today, many herbalists recommend onion juice either singly or in combination with other natural items as a remedy for grey and thinning hair. What the research found The new research, which was published in The FASB Journal , also found that the modified catalase compound also works for the skin condition vitiligo (a skin pigment condition marked by loss of skin color). Reported study author Karin U. Schallreuter, M.D. from the Institute for Pigmentary Disorders : 'To date, it is beyond any doubt that the sudden loss of the inherited skin and localized hair color can affect those individuals in many fundamental ways. The improvement of quality of life after total and even partial successful repigmentation has been documented.' In 2009, a similar breakthrough for grey hair was reported which also found that hydrogen peroxide buildup was a culprit and that the compound catalase could reverse grey hair. That research was conducted by Bradford University in the UK. Other natural solutions for grey hair Over the years, many remedies for grey hair have been used with mixed results. Some of the better known ones include: The oriental remedy fo-ti has a long history of being used for grey hair. Fo-ti is also called he shou wu, which translates to 'black-haired Mr. He' or 'Mr. He's black hair'. Black Strap molasses has worked well for many people for restoration of color, but it may take some time (as is true with other remedies as well). Pine needle tea is another remedy which has been used to help with greying hair. Many have reported that moringa leaf and moringa root extracts have restored hair color as well as helped with thinning hair. Nutrition for hair health As is true for the entire body, good nutrition is essential for healthy hair. The best diet for hair health is a wholesome diet which is rich in silica, B-vitamins, omega-3s, protein, calcium and iron. Other important nutrients include antioxidants, trace minerals and vitamin A. Some of the best foods for hair health include: Oats Sweet rice and mochi (pounded sweet rice) Nuts and seeds Leafy, green vegetables Root vegetables, such as carrots, rutabagas, parsnips, ginger, turnips, and onions Winter squash Black beans Pumpkin Black pepper Brown rice syrup Seaweed Microalgae Foods to avoid for better hair health: Cold foods and drinks Sugary foods and drinks Fatty foods Animal protein Tofu Salt Dairy products "
0," In November 2014, an investigation by NBC Bay Area made a shocking discovery when they learned that the oil and gas industry had been dumping, or pumping, billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into federally protected underground aquifers. Until recently, little was known about the liquid mixture of chemicals that are used to crack geological formations in the ground, releasing profitable natural oil and gas. Today, we know that the injection mixture contains over 200 different chemicals, including diesel, biocides and benzene. While previous reports alleged that groundwater contamination caused by fracking was a result of faulty equipment, NBC Bay Area 's investigation unveils a deliberate act that is much more sinister. When oil and gas companies frack, they inject massive amounts of water into the ground. Oftentimes, this leftover wastewater is re-injected back into the ground where the oil extraction first took place. But other times, the wastewater is disposed of in nearby aquifers that according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are 'exempt,' meaning they're not clean enough for humans to drink or use, according to Jason Marshall, Chief Deputy Director for California's Department of Conservation. Investigation identifies more than 500 fracking injection wells suspected of dumping toxic wastewater into 'pristine' aquifers NBC Bay Area 's initial investigation revealed 'that in at least nine waste water injection wells, the waste water was injected into 'non-exempt' or clean aquifers containing high quality water.' However, according to California's Water Resources Control Board, a total of 532 injection wells are now suspected of dumping toxic wastewater into protected clean water aquifers. State officials were reportedly allowing oil and gas companies to dump the toxic chemicals into 'pristine,' federally protected underground aquifers located all over California including near Santa Clarita, Santa Barbara, Fresno, Paso Robles and Los Angeles in addition to Kern County. 'For decades, oil and gas companies were permitted to re-inject this wastewater into aquifers that already had higher levels of solids and chemicals in them, what the EPA refers to as 'exempt aquifers,'' reports NBC Bay Area . Now, it's been revealed that state regulators issued permits to oil and gas companies allowing them to inject that same wastewater into aquifers that were considered 'non-exempt' by the EPA. These 'non-exempt' aquifers are an incredibly important resource for a state that's 100 percent categorized as at least 'Abnormally Dry,' with about 93 percent of the region still in a 'Severe Drought' zone or worse. The clean, high-quality aquifers that could've been used for drinking water, to water animals and as irrigation are now potentially damaged beyond repair. 'It's inexcusable,' said Hollin Kretzmann, with the Center for Biological Diversity in San Francisco. 'That's a huge concern and communities who rely on water supply wells near these injection wells have a lot of reason to be concerned that they're finding high levels of arsenic and thallium and other chemicals nearby where these injection wells have been allowed to operate.' EPA orders California to bring wastewater injection program into federal compliance by 2017 In a letter to California's environmental agencies, the EPA demands that the state put a halt to this practice and bring the program into federal compliance by February 15, 2017. No one really knows how much damage has already been done, and how much more will be done over the next two years. State officials admit that testing shows that some drinking water wells located near the injection sites contain 'higher than acceptable' levels of toxicants including arsenic, nitrates and thallium, but they maintain that the presence of such chemicals are not a result of fracking.

0," According to a report released on June 18, 2013, special accommodations for pregnant women are often met with firm opposition from employers. It happened back in 2007 when a then 18-year old pregnant woman named Heather Myers was fired from her Walmart job for drinking water from a bottle. Even though she was clearly pregnant and according to her worker orientation meeting, drinking on the job, providing it is water, is acceptable for employees. However, in this case, the supervisor changed the rule and said that drinking water during work required a doctor's note. Myers, intending to comply with the new rule, got the doctor's note as requested. But then a new rule came into effect by the supervisor which stated that only fountain water was acceptable and that drinking from a water bottle was not. Urinary tract infections are common during pregnancy and other reasons aside, require more need for hydration for the expected mother At this time Myers had a urinary tract infection which required her to drink water more frequently. Her ultimatum was to either not hydrate (unless by fountain) or leave. She left and sued. In general, some places of business offer more courtesies to pregnant workers. For example, they are allowed to take more frequent bathroom breaks, and are able to sit at posts where they might normally stand. On top of that, they are allowed, as they should be, to drink water more often. Why is hydration important during pregnancy? Since human blood is made up primarily by the water that we consume and since the volume of blood is to increase by as much as 40 percent during pregnancy, regular and extra water intake is necessary. The fluid, when pregnant or not, is responsible for carrying nutrients to cells and taking toxins away. Other factors: The one quart or so of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby needs to be replaced every few hours Proper hydration regulates body temperature Dehydration can trigger uterine contractions, leading to premature labor The bottom line is that proper hydration is required to maintain a healthy pregnancy. "
0," Not all vitamins and dietary supplements are the same. Many popular supplement brands, in fact, contain artificial additives, synthetic flow agents, chemical colorings, and even imitation vitamin compounds that your body does not recognize and cannot fully process. So how can you know whether or not the vitamins and supplements you buy are safe and effective? Here are six helpful tips on what to watch out for when buying vitamins and supplements. 1) Synthetic vitamins . There is a big difference between the natural vitamins found in food and the so-called vitamins added to many popular dietary supplements. Whole-food based vitamins are uniquely bioavailable, and occur naturally in foods, plants, and herbs. Synthetic vitamins, on the other hand, are produced in a laboratory, and may be derived from toxic sources such as coal tar and petroleum. How can you know the difference? Synthetic vitamins are typically listed on ingredient labels by their isolated names -- ascorbic acid (vitamin C), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) are all examples of synthetic vitamins commonly added to vitamins and supplements, including multivitamin formulas. Stick with whole food-based vitamins and supplements, including those that clearly delineate their being derived from plants or other natural sources. 'In addition to being synthetic, isolated vitamins are missing all their naturally occurring essential synergistic co-factors and transporters,' explains the Organic Consumers Association (OCA). 'A synthetic vitamin can stimulate a cell's metabolism, but it cannot upgrade or replace the cell's components with superior, better quality elements. The results? A degraded cell.' ( http://www.organicconsumers.org/nutricon/qa.cfm ) 2) Magnesium stearate . Believe it or not, many supplements, including those made by more reputable brands, contain a flow agent additive that, over time, can actually block the absorption of nutrients into your body. This ingredient is known as magnesium stearate , and regular consumption of it is linked to the development of a harmful 'biofilm' in the intestines that may cause digestive problems. Despite having the word magnesium in its name, magnesium stearate is not a source of nutritive magnesium. The only reason why supplement manufacturers add the chalk-like substance to their products is to make them easier to process through manufacturing equipment. But the long-term health consequences of ingesting magnesium stearate may not be worth the risk. 3) Titanium dioxide . Another unnecessary additive found in many supplements, titanium dioxide, which is often used as a pigment in vitamins and supplements, comes with its own set of health risks. An untested nanoparticle powder made from titanium bits, titanium dioxide has been linked to causing autoimmune disorders, cancer, and various other diseases. Besides the fact that it belongs to a class of particles known to cause cell damage, titanium dioxide serves no therapeutic purpose whatsoever, which means it does not belong in a health supplement. 'Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen 'possibly carcinogen[ic] to humans,'' explains the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health & Safety on its website. 'This evidence showed that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation.' ( http://www.selfnews.com/027000_titanium_dioxide_vitamins.html ) 4) Artificial colors . Though not as common in more reputable vitamin and supplement brands, artificial colors are still present in many mainstream supplements. The Pfizer-owned brand of supplements marketed as Centrum, for instance, contain toxic coloring agents like FD&C; Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake and FD&C; Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake, both of which are potential neurotoxins. Even children's vitamins like Flintstones Complete contain these and other toxic coloring agents. ( http://www.greenmedinfo.com ) 5) Genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) . If your vitamin or supplement formula contains ingredients like maltodextrin, citric acid, dextrose, vegetable-based fillers, sugars of any kind, or even synthetic vitamin C (ascorbic acid), chances are it also contains GMOs. Unless specifically stated on the bottle as being GMO-free, a vitamin supplement that is not whole food-based more than likely contains ingredients derived from GMOs. Soybean oil is often used as a filler in gelcap-based supplements, and is a common source of GMOs. Vitamin E is another common GMO additive typically derived from soy, more than 90 percent of which is of GMO origin in the U.S. Other common GMO ingredients, unless otherwise labeled, include soy lecithin, inositol, choline, vegetable oil, and vegetable cellulose. ( http://www.responsibletechnology.org/docs/Non-GMO-Shopping-Guide.pdf ) 6) Irradiation . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently prohibits the use of irradiation as a sterilizing protocol for dietary supplements. But this does not mean that every raw ingredient used in dietary supplements is free of irradiation, as suppliers have been caught in the past illegally selling irradiated raw materials. A European Commission study from back in 2002, for instance, found that nearly half of all dietary supplements tested in Europe contained ingredients that had been illegally irradiated. ( http://www.nutraingredients.com ) Since most supplement manufacturers will insist that their products are not irradiated, the best way to know for sure is to ask a company directly whether or not it tests and verifies the integrity of all its raw ingredients. If it does not, urge the company to do so and ask for test results. "
0," Matt Monarch, founder of the Raw Food World ( www.RawFoodWorld.com ) has announced his intention to sue Adya, Inc. for what he describes to selfnews as damages, product misrepresentation and fraud. Matt Monarch's full statement is found below. Monarch told selfnews that he has been 'financially devastated' by dealing with Adya, Inc., because his company (Raw Food World) voluntarily announced a refund initiative that refunded the purchase price of customers who had purchased Adya Clarity. (Raw Food World was the largest distributor for Adya Clarity in North America, by far.) Adya, Inc., he says, has honored no such refunds and has even refused to refund unopened product that Monarch spent thousands of dollars to have shipped back to Adya, Inc. On top of this, Adya Inc. is threatening to sue Monarch for roughly $200,000 which the company claims is owed by Monarch for product that he has already attempted to return to the company. In addition to the legal action announced below, selfnews is initiating legal action against Adya, Inc. in an attempt to force a court-ordered halt to the importation and distribution of Adya, Inc. products in order to protect the health and safety of consumers. Details of that action are to be announced soon here at selfnews.com. Statement by Matt Monarch / Raw Food World: Adya, Inc. is Suing 'My Family!' Can you believe this!? Do you remember how we voluntarily offered refunds about eight months ago for a product called Adya Clarity? It has been an extremely financially draining process; we gave a refund or store credit to everyone who asked for one, even though refunds were not officially ordered and it was very challenging economically for us to do this. We actually have about 10% of these refunds still left to process right now, which we hope to complete as soon as possible. Over the last eight months, we have hired another six employees to help handle this crisis. It has been an immensely time- and energy-consuming process and Angela and I have invested every last personal liquid asset of ours into this process, with absolutely zero refunds or compensation from Adya, Inc. Out of all the raw food companies that sold Adya Clarity , we were the first to stand up and offer refunds. The majority of these other companies didn't even follow through with refunding all of their customers, as we are doing. We followed through with all of these thousands of refunds, because we felt it was the ethical thing to do, and now Adya, Inc. has the audacity to try to sue my 'family and I'! Adya, Inc. is suing 'The Raw Food World, Inc.' for about $200,000.00 . They are also threatening me that this is just the first lawsuit and that they have intentions to sue me for defamation, because as their biggest distributor I pulled out of selling their product and voluntarily offered all of my customers refunds for their purchases. I intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Why is Adya, Inc. suing me? When the whole 'Adya drama' went down, which I'll describe further below, I emailed Adya, Inc to ask if I could return our unopened and untouched product stock, which was all received to our warehouse within the last 7 - 30 days of that request. They responded yes and gave me a 'pro number' for this return. I then spent $5,000 - $6,000 to ship the product back. After I had already paid to send the product back, they rejected the shipment. They are also now demanding a massive amount of interest on the balance and 'lawyer fees'. Additionally, I returned more than double the amount of product compared to our outstanding balance, so technically they owe me money. However, from the graciousness of my heart, I decided to let it all go and I didn't refuse charges on my credit cards or anything of that nature. Adya, Inc. has not issued one single refund for anyone. Right now we're at a point where we've finished refunding 90% of all the thousands and thousands of refund requests from customers. Angela and I have not even taken one penny from 'The Raw Food World, Inc.' over the last eight months , in order to swiftly refund everyone as best we can and make this right. We have been fortunate enough to be able to live off our land by growing our own food and so on. Now, with this nonsensical court case against The Raw Food World, we're being required to put all of our funds into defending the company. We were so close to finishing these refunds and moving on. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) The history of Adya Clarity and The Raw Food World: I started selling a product called Adya Clarity in which I strongly believed. This product became popular and started to gain a lot of attention. About eight months ago as I write this, Mike Adams, the man behind the most popular online 'natural news' website in the world posted seven articles about the different potential dangers of this product. These articles can be viewed by clicking here . I was in shock when I saw these posts starting to come out. When I realized that there may have been even a slight chance that this product could potentially harm a human being, we offered refunds or store credits to everyone who had requested one, to make this right. Now Adya, Inc. is threatening to sue me for defamation, due to this. We've refunded thousands of customers and Adya, Inc. has decided to not even refund distributors like us or the direct customers who were not satisfied with their product, which is claimed to be harmful in these articles. Personally I don't understand why the other raw food companies out there are not speaking up against Adya, Inc. Practically every single online raw food store that I know of was selling Adya Clarity on their website. Most of these companies took down this product silently and swiftly when this fiasco began and remained silent. We are the largest online Raw Foods and Superfoods store in the world and we work ethically and with integrity. Where others just made a quick apology and offered minimal if any refunds, Angela and I went to the very depths of giving away almost everything we had to take care of this mess. I hope that this integrity is clear to all of my clients and that we continue to earn the title that the majority of the Raw Foods and Health Foods Community seems to have deemed fitting for us; the most trusted source of high-end Raw Foods and Superfoods in the world. There is nothing more important than being with our families and Adya, Inc. is making this possibility challenging for me through their actions, threatening to draw me away to deal with court proceedings. However, as fanatical as I am about health and family, I am also fanatical about being ethical and doing what feels like the 'right thing' and what Adya, Inc. is trying to do here is, from my point of view, absolutely absurd . I feel that Adya Inc, is 'stealing' from my 'family' by trying to get me to leave them and go into a massive court battle. Additionally, they are trying to steal from our family-owned corporation, of which my wife Angela and I are the sole officers. We will be responding to Adya, Inc's lawsuit and will seek compensation for the damage caused to The Raw Food World, Inc. The reason I didn't file a lawsuit before, is because I'm not the type of guy who likes to get into legal battles and I don't at all enjoy the negative energy associated with lawsuits. I just can't justify giving these people the money they are demanding! I will do everything in my power to either get these cases dropped or fight them until the very end. The reason I wanted to inform you about all of this is to let you in on the absurdity that is going on here in my life right now and also maybe get your help in getting Adya, Inc. to drop their case against us. I guess the best thing that you can do, if willing, is just pray with us regarding this dilemma and send love into this situation, whenever you can. It would truly be a dream come true for us, if Adya, Inc. would drop their case against us. There is nothing more that I could ask for in life but to be able to stay home with my family. I'll keep you all updated on how this turns out. Thank you all for your ongoing love and support that you bless us with! I will continue to do everything in my power to serve you in the best way that I can. As you can see with our monthly 'At-Cost' specials 'At-Cost' here, I will continue to always strive to get you wholesale pricing on the highest-end Raw Food and Superfood products in the world, to nourish you and your family for many decades to come! Sincerely, Matt Monarch and Family "
0," The European Union Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seemingly handed Monsanto a victory on November 12, when it released a report concluding that the company's global bestselling herbicide chemical glyphosate is 'unlikely' to be a carcinogen. But a careful reading of the EFSA report actually reveals a different conclusion: the EFSA said that while glyphosate itself may be unlikely to cause cancer, the actual products that farmers and consumers are exposed to such as Roundup are indeed likely to cause genetic damage that may lead to cancer . This marks one of the first times that a government safety agency has acknowledged that so-called 'inactive' ingredients in chemical products may be just as dangerous as the active ingredients. Carcinogen or not? Roundup is one of the world's most popular herbicides, and its use has exploded since the advent of Monstanto's Roundup resistant ('Roundup Ready') genetically modified crops. In the United States alone, 250 million pounds of Roundup's active ingredient glyphosate are applied each year. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) officially classified glyphosate as a 'probable' carcinogen, based on an extensive review of the research. The EFSA report is part of a re-assessment of glyphosate that will be used by EU member states to decide whether to continue allowing the chemical's use within their borders. It acknowledged the potential toxicity of glyphosate , setting an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.5 mg per kg of body weight for the chemical. This is the first time that any government has created an ARfD for glyphosate. An ARfD is the amount of a substance that can safely be consumed in food over a short time period, such as at one meal, or within one day. In its report, the EFSA addressed the difference between its conclusions and those of the IARC. The EFSA notes that its study examined only glyphosate on its own, and did not examine studies conducted on glyphosate formulations that included other ingredients (that is, all glyphosate-containing products sprayed in the real world). The IARC, in contrast, reviewed not just studies on glyphosate alone but also studies conducted on the safety of Roundup and other glyphosate-containing products. The EFSA's method is a result of the fact that EU rules require every chemical mixture to be assessed and marketed separately. Highlights broken regulatory system Because of the difference between EFSA and IARC findings, the EFSA said that it is likely the supposedly inactive ingredients in Roundup and other glyphosate-containing herbicides that led to the genetic damage seen in the IARC studies. 'Although some studies suggest that certain glyphosate-based formulations may be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA), others that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect,' the EFSA wrote. 'It is likely, therefore, that the genotoxic effects observed in some glyphosate-based formulations are related to the other constituents or 'co-formulants.' Similarly, certain glyphosate-based formulations display higher toxicity than that of the active ingredient, presumably because of the presence of co-formulants.' The EFSA's conclusions highlight a gap in government safety testing policies that independent scientists have long warned about: laws typically require medium- and long-term safety tests of only of a product's active ingredients. Yet studies show that inactive ingredients may often be more toxic than active ones, or that various ingredients may interact to form a more toxic mixture. For example, a 2014 study in the journal Biomedical Research International found that in eight out of nine major pesticides tested, the commercial formula (to which people are actually exposed in the real world), was up to 1,000 times more toxic than the so-called active ingredient. "
0," Most people who smoke a pack a day of cigarettes know they are treading on thin ice regarding their health, but how many people realize that drinking 30 or more ounces of diet soda each day could prove to be more lethal than a pack of cigarettes? And how can diet soda be worse than regular soda? Even though there are over 4,000 chemicals in one commercial cigarette, the leading chemical in diet soda may actually be breeding more cancer cells in human beings, and thus leading to malignant tumors sooner in life, according to recent research. ( http://naturalsociety.com ) Could cancer be the end result of depression? Killing brain neurons and expediting cell death may be killing people faster than lung cancer, and chronic depression is fuel for overwhelming cell mutation and the taking over of organs by mutagenic warped cells, also known as blood cancer. ( http://www.holisticmed.com/aspartame/ ) People who smoke cigarettes are locked into a vicious cycle of boosting their ambition and dopamine levels with a highly addicting drug, nicotine. The cigarette hangover, which begins with smoking 4,000 chemicals and then waiting for the nicotine to subside, is just the beginning of lung cancer and the mutation of cells. Cancer thrives in an acidic body where the cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Yet, even worse than cigarettes are artificial sweeteners, which fool the body into ingesting them, as if they are food, and polluting the cleansing organs with mutagens. Some research shows the body never excretes all of the aspartame, sorbitol, sucralose or saccharin. When a human consumes Equal, Splenda, Nutrasweet, Sweet-n-Low, etc. , their cleansing organs, like the liver, kidneys, and pancreas are overworking and malnourished. You cannot live without these organs. Aspartame is GMO, so the blood is infected, with synthetic carcinogens (which it does not release properly, if ever) which cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders and make you hungrier! That's right, synthetic sugars drive hunger and actually make most people put on weight. How ironic, right? ( http://www.selfnews.com/033914_Splenda_Essentials_sweetener.html ) It is proven that obesity is a driving force of cancer, so whether you consume excess SUGAR or ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS, you are feeding the same destructive forces in your body, in your cells, changing your DNA, and the long term effects have 'no cure.' So, when it all boils down to it, drinking 3 or 4 diet sodas per day is more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes, about 20 cigarettes, in one day. Although diet sodas contain less chemicals than cigarettes, these specific 'diet' chemicals are choking cells and mutating DNA at a higher rate, leading to chronic disorders of the digestive track, breakdown of the CNS and ultimately leads to the development of cancerous tumors. It is 'programmed cell death' and your mitochondria cells are basically suffocating. If you combine toxic food and toxic medications prescribed by Western doctors (MDs), the addictions being 'programmed in' are like programming an early death. ( http://www.zenantidiet.com/ ) There is no prescription drug, and there never will be one, which cures the problems that artificial sweeteners create . Over 70 percent of reported cases of fibromyalgia, chronic depression, IBS and acid reflux are caused by consuming chemical agents which have been approved by the FDA. ( http://www.selfnews.com ) The good news is that there are natural cures for both diet soda addiction and cigarette addiction.

0," The health benefits offered by pecans are greater than previously believed, according to a new study published in The Journal of Nutrition . Researchers from Loma Linda University (LLU) in California have identified a host of beneficial antioxidants found in pecans that benefit the heart, lower bad cholesterol levels, and protect against disease-causing inflammation. Dr. Ella Haddad and her team from LLU evaluated 16 men and women between the ages of 23 and 44 who were assigned to eat one of three diets. The first diet contained about three ounces of whole pecans, the second contained three ounces of blended pecans with water, and the third contained a control item. The team took blood samples of participants at various intervals up to 24 hours after consumption of the meals, and they observed a clear increase in oxygen radical absorbance capabilities (ORAC) as well as lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels among those who ate the pecan-enriched meals. 'Our tests show that eating pecans increases the amount of healthy antioxidants in the body,' said Haddad, who is also an associate professor at LLU's School of Public Health. 'This protective effect is important in helping to prevent development of various diseases such as cancer and heart disease.' Rich in tocopherols, a natural form of vitamin E, pecans contain specifically high levels of gamma-tocopherols, a form of vitamin E closely associated with inflammation reduction. In the study, blood levels of this important form of vitamin E doubled in just eight hours after pecan consumption. And after just three hours, gamma-tocopherol levels notably decreased LDL cholesterol levels in the body by 33 percent. 'This study is another piece of evidence that pecans are a healthy food,' added Haddad. 'Previous research has shown that pecans contain antioxidant factors. Our study shows these antioxidants are indeed absorbed in the body and provide a protective effect against diseases.' A previous LLU study published in The Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that simply adding pecans to one's diet can help lower cholesterol levels by 116.5 percent more than the American Heart Association's (AHA) Step I diet can. Together, the two studies confirm the incredible health-promoting power of pecans. Sources for this story include: http://www.lef.org/news/LefDailyNews.htm?New... "
0," Big Pharma's pill pushers and natural remedy skeptics are always trying to drill one idea into your brain: 'Natural remedies are a ripoff!' they say. 'And they aren't even proven to work!' In response to those skeptics, allow me to introduce a new cancer treatment drug called Folotyn , made by a small drug company named Allos Therapeutics . It costs $30,000 a month . That's a thousand dollars a day, mathematically speaking. But here's the best part: Folotyn has never been proven to save lives . That's the complaint about natural remedies from conventional medicine pushers, and it reveals the contradiction in their criticism: When natural remedies aren't proven to work, they call them 'quackery.' But when their $30,000-a-month medicines aren't proven to work, they don't have any problem with that. Take your medicine and stop asking questions! Who needs scientific proof when they're already so sure they're right? Folotyn has been proven, by the way, to shrink tumors by 27%. Of course, you can accomplish the same thing with vitamin D, spirulina, green tee, medicinal mushrooms and other anti-cancer nutritional therapies. Even if you went all-out and bought a huge collection of anti-cancer supplements and started taking them aggressively, you'd be hard pressed to consume more than $2,000 worth of product in a single month. That's a $28,000 savings over Folotyn, and the best part is that all those supplements would boost your brain health, heart health, liver health, kidney health and immune health at the same time. Or, you could just exercise outdoors, getting both vitamin D and exercise for free , saving you $30,000 a month while healing your own cancer . (It also helps to give up all the cancer-causing chemicals in your foods, personal care products, home cleaning products and medicines.) I don't know about you, but I'd much rather save the $30,000 and just heal the cancer myself. That might be good advice for you and me, but it would spell financial disaster for the cancer industry. A thousand dollars a day to poison yourself Reading this news about this $1,000-a-day cancer drug makes me laugh, because lots of people still complain about the cost of a $19 book on cancer cures, or a $20 bottle of superfoods that contains anti-cancer medicine. Somehow, any amount of money seems justifiable for conventional medicine, but even the smallest investments in personal nutrition or wellbeing are met with a lot of resistance. I remember talking with a couple at an acupuncture clinic a few years back. They were complaining about the price of the $75 acupuncture treatments for infertility. When I asked them what they had tried before, they told me they had spent something like $20,000 on an infertility clinic, with no success. Wow! And $75 is expensive? Now, if a legitimate cancer cure really was offered by conventional medicine (and it never will be, because such a cure would destroy their business model), it might be worth $30,000 or more. Heck, a one-time cure might be worth a million dollars, but don't hold your breath on that one... no chemical cure is forthcoming. Not from the world of conventional medicine, anyway. The only cures that exist today are from the realm of natural medicine , where cancer is routinely cured by patients who heal themselves with the help of natural cancer clinics all around the world. And at those cancer clinics, the entire treatment is usually far less than $30,000. Of course, if you really want to poison yourself while paying somebody $1,000 a day, this high-priced chemotherapy agent might be just what you're looking for. But you can chug wheatgrass shots for less than ten bucks a day and probably get just as much tumor shrinkage -- at 1/100th the cost! Draining you bank account before you die Conventional cancer treatments are a ripoff. They cost you a fortune and they don't even work. No one has ever been cured by cancer from chemotherapy. Not a single person... ever! There isn't a single documented case anywhere in the medical literature claiming that a person was cured of cancer from chemotherapy. So why do people still fall for the chemo scam? The answer: Because they're desperate . They're dying, and they're willing to pay anything for hope, even if it's a false hope thrust upon them by their oncologist. It is in this context that these cancer drug companies charge $10,000 a month, $20,000 a month or even now $30,000 a month to treat you with their 'breakthrough' cancer drugs. The purpose of all this isn't to cure your cancer: It's to drain your bank account before you die , extracting every last dollar of your savings and retirement money before you expire. No one out-quacks the cancer industry in terms of exploiting the fears of dying elderly patients. If this were done in the financial industry, it would be called a swindle . If an investment con man targeted sick, elderly people, promising some miraculous result if they just paid him $30,000 a month, he'd be arrested and locked up as a purveyor of financial fraud . But when the cancer industry perpetrates the same fraud on our nation's elderly, they get away with it! No one questions the fraud. No one realizes the industry is based on fraudulent marketing and fraudulent science combined with a huge financial con that convinces sick, elderly patients to part with their life's savings in exchange for some high-tech quackery that will never save them. Part of the reason this con continues, I think, is because the victims of it don't live very long. Dead men don't talk, and dead cancer patients don't file complaints with the Better Business Bureau.

0," Field trials of genetically-modified (GM) Bt eggplant, also known as Bt talong, have officially ceased in the Philippines following a major ruling by the nation's Court of Appeals. Representing a massive victory for food sovereignty, the Court found that Bt talong is a monumental threat to both environmental and human health, and has subsequently ordered that all existing plantings of Bt talong in test fields be immediately destroyed and blocked from further propagation. Like in many other nations across the globe, the biotechnology industry has been craftily trying to sneak its genetic poisons into the Philippines under the guise of improving crop yields, reducing chemical use, and yada yada ad nauseum - all the typical industry propaganda and lies used to convince the more gullible among us that GMOs are some kind of food production miracle. But the Philippines is not buying all the hype. And unlike the U.S., the southeast Asian country is taking a bold stand against a technology that has never been proven safe or beneficial in any way. According to the non-profit advocacy group Greenpeace , which has been working on behalf of humanity to stem the tide of GMO onslaught all around the world, the Court recently issued a 'Write of Kalikasan,' which basically means that all field trials of Bt eggplant in the Philippines must stop. The Court also ordered that the biotechnology aggressors 'permanently cease and desist' from conducting further trials, as well as 'protect, preserve, rehabilitate and restore' all the land they have destroyed in the process. 'The field trials of Bt talong involve the willful and deliberate alteration of the genetic traits of a living element of the ecosystem and the relationship of living organisms that depend on each other for their survival,' states the ruling. 'Consequently, the field trials ... could not be declared by this Court as safe [for] human health and our ecology, [since they are] an alteration of an otherwise natural state of affairs in our ecology.' Philippines light years ahead of US in adopting precautionary principle, protecting its people and food supply from corporate takeover Everything about this common-sense decision by the Filipino justice system makes perfect sense - GMOs definitively spread their poisonous traits throughout the entire ecosystem, contaminating other crops along the way, and thus have no place in agriculture, period. But sadly, such common sense no longer exists in the U.S., where corporate greed and fundamental corruption have essentially placed profits before people in every aspect of life. 'We commend the Court of Appeals for living up to its constitutionally-mandated role as protector of constitutional rights,' said Greenpeace Southeast Asia Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner Daniel Ocampo about the Philippines rejecting GMOs. 'This landmark decision reflects that there are indeed flaws and lapses in the current regulatory process for Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) such as Bt eggplant which exposes our environment and health to unknown long-term consequences and does not establish their safety in any way.' Meanwhile, millions of acres of uncontested GMO crops in the U.S. continue to ravage both human and environmental health while the hordes of mindless puppets in the U.S. Congress ignore the issue or even pretend that GMOs are not an issue. But this new American pastime of greed and denial about reality will not last forever, as nature will eventually catch up and extinguish this agricultural scourge with 'superweeds,' 'superbugs,' and disease - that is if the American people do not take action first to forcibly cleanse their nation of GMOs. The question is, what will it take for the people to wake up and take action? "
0," Most people don't even know what 'staged' means when it comes to politics. Most people think that Congress and the President love America, what it stands for, the Constitution and the Founding Fathers. People think that, because these rich white snobs went to some Ivy league school 40 or 50 years ago and crawled their way from some crappy city council job to mayor or some state job and on up to some governor or Big Business CEO type job, these clowns care about 'doing what's right' for the country. Also, aren't conspiracy theories for crazy people, guys who took too much acid in the '60s and started brainstorming about how 'The Man' is watching them every second and just waiting to arrest everyone for treason? Aren't conspiracy theories for people who are like anarchists or think the world is going to turn into George Orwell's 1984 , or something? Conspiracy paranoia is reserved for the people who think that somehow the Government helped enact the Sandy Hook incident to be able to jump-start major gun control legislation, because the congress folk are scared that, well, if they bury the country too deep in debt TOO soon, everyone will rise up out of the 'woodworks' and storm Washington DC with their semi-automatic and automatic weapons, the ones that were NOT used at the mass shootings. ( http://www.westernjournalism.com ) Acts I, II, III, and IV are all 'staged' 'Staged' is something that is 'contrived for a desired impression': i.e., 'it was staged, rather than spontaneous.' Also, it means something 'occurring or planned to occur in stages.' A staged Government shutdown would be a conspiracy theory then, right? It would be if the Government faked like they were shut down in order to accomplish OTHER motives, other M.O.s (methods of operation), as the gangsters call it, or the Mafia, or the Wall Street FAT CATS. A staged government shutdown would be crazy to even talk about, because, really, HOW could a government that's spending a TRILLION a year fighting a war in some desert and mountains overseas, where no nation has ever overthrown the Arab resilience, shut down the OCEAN, the NATIONAL PARKS, the WWII memorial and even publicly open parks they don't even own or manage? Is this somehow theatrics to accomplish some other goal? Is the curtain going to close and the actors all come out and bow for the applause? Is there a final act? Mike Adams of selfnews has coverage of ACT I, II and III of Obama-Theatre , and he may have the ENCORE predicted almost precisely. There is foreshadowing. There is drama (CNN), there is scary music and scary images that are very shocking. It really hurts when you see the lies exposed so raw and in your face: ( http://www.infowars.com ). Get ready for the Hollow Screams! ( http://www.selfnews.com ) 'Millions of Americans are completely fed up with the shenanigans of bad government. They've had it. Coming up in a few days, thousands of truckers are about to converge on the highways in D.C. and shut the roadways down. They're even threatening to arrest traitorous members of Congress who have violated their oaths of office.' Check out the theater and be the JUDGE yourself: Here are the actors of Sandy Hook gun control theater at their very best. This whistleblower on YouTube exposes the whole story like a good lawyer: ( http://www.youtube.com ). 'It's all just 'shutdown theater.' It's the Cirque du Soleil of Big Government, except that in this circus, all the acrobats are over-medicated diabetics, and therefore the entire show is pulled off with high wires, smoke and mirrors instead of actual acrobatic talent. That's the Obama way. Pure theater. 100% illusion and rhetoric. And you have a front row seat to watch all the B.S. unfold right before your very eyes... how fortunate!'

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Is it conceivable that massage can provide more effective relief from low back pain than medication? A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests this therapy might indeed alleviate back pain better in the short term than traditional interventions of medicine, bed rest or exercise: Healthday reports. The investigation conducted by the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle involved 400 patients who had low back pain, the majority of which were middle aged, Caucasian and female. Researchers found those who were given a series of relaxation massage or structural massage were better able to work and be active than those who were given traditional medical care, such as pain pills, muscle relaxants or physical therapy. According to The New York Times , the study's participants were randomly divided into three groups: structural massage, relaxation massage and traditional care. Patients in the massage groups received one hour of therapy weekly for 10 weeks. At the conclusion of the 10 week period, over one-third of the patients who were given massage therapy reported their pain was much improved or eliminated completely, as opposed to only one in 25 patients who were given traditional care. Furthermore, patients in the massage groups were twice as likely to have spent fewer days in bed rest, used less pain pills and participated in more activity than the traditional care group. Lead author Daniel Cherkin was surprised by the fact that structural massage did not prove superior to relaxation massage in relieving pain. Structural massage involves manipulating specific back pain related muscles and ligaments, while relaxation massage, otherwise known as Swedish massage, involves inducing body-wide relaxation. The beneficial effects of the massage seemed not only to be experienced during the 10-week therapy period, but also to linger for a time following the cessation of therapy. Evidence of this lingering effect was manifested by the fact that the massage groups continued to display improved function six months after the study's onset. At the one year mark, however, no significant differences were found in the three groups. Although the researchers were uncertain of massage therapy's exact mechanism of action for easing back pain , they voiced several theories. One suggestion was that it either stimulated tissue locally or produced a general central nervous system response. Another speculation was that merely spending time in a relaxing environment and feeling cared for might have been responsible for the improvement. An additional factor to consider is the subjectivity that is impossible to eliminate in such studies. Patients in the control group were aware that the other groups were receiving massage and this knowledge may have caused them to discount their own progress. It should be reiterated that the study suggests rather than proves the benefit of massage for back pain . Also, some members of the American medical community not associated with the research have expressed reluctance to accept the suggested benefits as being valid. Conversely, the study's authors offered their assessments of its import. Cherkin characterizes the results as being 'pretty strong.' He states the massage was tested on patients who did not improve using the standard medical approach to back pain treatment. He feels that massage therapy is a reasonable thing to try for anyone getting insufficient relief from this malady. The coauthor, Dr. Richard Deyo, feels that massage appears to provide clinicians with another choice for managing the challenging medical problem of chronic low back pain . http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-... http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/emb... http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PainManagement/...

0," New research in the August 1 issue of Cancer reveals that men diagnosed with prostate cancer tend to rush into their decision on treatment, as well as make those decisions based on inaccurate beliefs about the disease. Conventional medicine generally offers four treatment options for prostate cancer patients: removal of the prostate gland; 'seeding' the cancer with radioactive material; externally radiation; or cryptotherapy, which freezes the tumor. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 20 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients after treatment options had been explained by a urologist. They discovered that 19 of the 20 patients chose a course of treatment based partly on the experiences of a friend or relative who'd had the disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Thomas D. Denberg, stressed that prostate cancer patients should avoid comparing their own cancer experience the experiences of others. 'Because Uncle Fred did well with a certain procedure doesn't mean that you will,' Denberg said. Though all the patients in the study said they understood that the cancer progressed slowly, 12 patients wanted treatment as soon as possible, eight of which believed that surgery was the best option. Patients also made treatment decisions based on the misconceptions that a cure was guaranteed if the tumor was confined to the prostate, and that the chance of being cured was still high even if the tumor spread beyond the prostate. Researchers also found that the men who had decided on surgery rejected the other options, and the men who opted for radiation therapy preferred seeding over external radiation, citing efficacy and possible negative side effects. The study's authors say that men should not rush into a treatment decision, and should educate themselves on the disease to avoid common misperceptions. Proponents of alternative cancer treatments say that men should also look into safe, natural treatments for prostate cancer, including vitamin D from sunlight, green tea and the minerals selenium and zinc. Pomegranate juice has recently been discovered to markedly slow the growth of prostate cancer tumors. ### "
0," Middle-age-spread is a real issue for both men and women who step into their 40s. As the metabolism slows down with age, and the muscle mass is reduced as well, it's increasingly difficult for the body to burn fat and stay fit. Although some handle it better than others, middle age is far from a breezy walk through the park for most people. Under these stressful circumstances, some people find comfort in food or alcohol, both of which also tend to show around the waist. But it's not all hopeless for those trying to fight the dreaded middle-age-spread. According to a new study of large proportions published in the journal BMJ , a minor change in diet can actually help you stay slim throughout your 40s. Here's how. The BMJ study on flavonoids and weight changes The BMJ study was the largest of its kind so far. It involved more than 124,000 middle aged and older people, who self-reported their weight once every two years, and their diet once every four years. The researchers analyzed this data over 24 years and, after adjusting for smoking and fitness activities, discovered that people who ate more flavonoid-rich foods maintained their weight better or even lost a few pounds. Flavonoids are natural compounds found in plants, where they perform a number of important roles. For instance, they are responsible for the proper communication between plant cells, as well as for creating attractive colors for bees and butterflies, which can help with pollination. Some flavonoid-heavy foods are strawberries, bananas, grapes, pears, onions, prunes, peppers, green tea and many others, but also chocolate and wine. It seems that with human beings, flavonoids might prevent unwanted weight gain. While most adults between 18 and 49 tend to gain one or two pounds every year, those involved in the study who adhered to a flavonoid-rich diet gained an average of 0.16 to 0.23 fewer pounds every four years. Berries showed the best results Different foods contain different types of flavonoids. The flavonoids that showed the best results in relation to weight gain were the anthocyanin, which can be found in strawberries, blackberries, blueberries , cherries, grapes, radishes and blackcurrants. Flavonoid polymers found in apples and green tea also showed promising results, as did the flavonols commonly found in tea and onions . While the results of the study might not seem impressive to those looking to lose weight fast, they are nevertheless extremely promising for people dreading the middle-age-spread. For them, it was outstanding news that something as simple as eating a handful of their favorite berries can help them maintain their weight throughout their 40s. <='' h1=''>The study published in the journal BMJ was only observational, but its authors had more in mind than the weight of the participants. As it is today, most Americans don't even eat one cup of fruit or two cups of veggies per day. By showing that some fruits like berries can be linked to weight loss, the researchers hoped to encourage people to eat more fruit overall. What's more, earlier studies on flavonoids indicated potential health benefits other than maintaining a desirable weight. Indeed, flavonoid-rich foods were shown to increase energy expenditure and therefore decrease fat absorption, while also working as efficient anti-inflammatories. The intake of flavonoids has been associated with a decreased risk of certain cancers, as well as with the support of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. At the end of the day, you just can't go wrong by eating a few more of your favorite berries. Not only will they help you maintain your desired weight through middle age, but they're also likely to help you fight a score of other life-threatening diseases.

0," Mercury is a highly toxic substance, but it is still used openly in the modern world. With its ability to cause permanent brain damage to children, kill babies in the womb and inflict kidney damage in adults, mercury is one of the most overlooked toxic substances today. Mercury pollution levels concerning The most dangerous form of mercury, methyl mercury, wreaks havoc on the human immune system, altering enzymes and also damaging the nervous system, manipulating coordination and senses like touch, sight and taste. Sources of toxic mercury pollution include incineration of coal, broken thermometers, medical waste and metal processing. Mercury pollution is also found in gold mines, where it is used as an extracting agent. These environmental sources of mercury pollution contaminate water sources, building up in the food chain of aquatic life. Some fish species are teeming with mercury now. Sadly, this toxin is packaged and sold to the public in many different forms. Mercury amalgams are a time-release poison One of the most disheartening applications is the insertion of mercury into a person's face via a dental amalgam. These mercury fillings are the dental industry's quick and common answer for cavities. While alternative options exist, many people revert back to the 32-year-old tradition of filling their teeth full of mercury. After inserted, these mercury fillings become a time-release poison that ultimately leak straight into the bloodstream. This leads to harm to the kidneys and the nervous system. Spirulina protects against permanent mercury damage in kidneys For some time, mercury has been thought to incite permanent damage to the kidneys, but new research shows hope that the damage can be reversed or protected against. A study from the University of Rjasthan, India, reports that Spirulina fusiformis can protect kidneys from the toxic effects of mercury and reverse damage done to the organs. The kidneys, which are the main site of deposition of inorganic mercury, are an easy target for mercury toxicity. Spirulina, the blue-green cyanobacteria, was investigated for its ability to modify mercury-induced kidney damage in Swiss albino mice. The study consisted of four groups. One group of albino mice was administered a control solution of sodium chloride. The second group was burdened with 5.0 mg/kg of mercury chloride solution. The third group was given mercury chloride and treated with 800 mg/kg of oral spirulina. The fourth group was given Spirulina fusiformis 10 days prior to being poisoned with mercury chloride. The spirulina was then consistently administered up to 30 days after the mercury chloride poisoning took place. The researchers studied various activities of the mice kidneys on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 15th and 30th days after treatment. They studied alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. When the kidneys of the mice were taxed with mercury chloride, MDA content and ACP activity were enhanced while LDH and ALP activity decreased. These actions prove that significant damage is done to the kidneys when dosed with mercury. The damage also included pathological alterations, as the glomerulus, proximal and distal tubules degenerated inside the kidneys. When spirulina treatments were given, the damage was reversed, as MDA content and ACP activity decreased. Elevation of LDH and ALP activity was also observed during spirulina treatments. In the pre and post spirulina treatment group, damages to pathological alterations in the kidneys were reduced. The scientists confirmed that Spirulina fusiformis has the power to 'significantly modify the renal damages against mercuric chloride induced toxicity.' "
0," An investigation by The Guardian reveals that CIA agents organized a fake vaccination scheme to harvest DNA from innocent civilians as part of a secret intelligence operation. The scheme was carried out in the town of Abbottabad, where Bin Laden's family was believed to be hiding. And the purpose of the vaccination scheme was to acquire the DNA of Bin Laden family members in order to identify where Bin Laden was hiding ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/11/... ). This is the first time the mainstream media has gone public with a story admitting that vaccines are used as weapons of war , and it proves that vaccination programs sometimes have nothing to do with public health at all (and everything to do with killing people, which was the entire purpose of locating Bin Laden). How could taking DNA samples from civilians help the CIA determine where Bin Laden's family was located? Because they already had DNA samples from Bin Laden's sister who died in Boston in 2010. With that DNA sample in hand, it is a simple matter to determine which other samples are genetically related and then zero in on the desired target. Vaccines used to covertly harvest DNA without consent It also shows that vaccinations can be used to harvest DNA without the knowledge of the vaccine recipients. This isn't even new: The U.S. government openly admitted in 2007 that it harvests the DNA of newborn babies and keeps a ' DNA database' of nearly all newborns ( http://www.prisonplanet.com/newborns-dna-rou... ). It's all described in a law called The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 ( http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bil... ) which mandates that blood samples from newborns be harvested in order to extract DNA information which is held by the U.S. government . This is all done without parental consent. Hospitals do this secretly and quietly, not raising any alerts or questions over the practice. Most parents have no idea the blood of their baby is being secretly held by the U.S. government. But now we see something far worse: The setting up of a fake vaccination drive whose purpose was solely to harvest DNA in order to track the location of an individual slated to be murdered by the U.S. government. According to The Guardian , the CIA agents even launched the fake vaccination scheme in a poor part of town just to make it look real. They also canvassed the town with vaccination posters that encouraged people to go get vaccinated. A Pakistani doctor named Shakil Afridi was reportedly recruited by the CIA to conduct the vaccination campaign, lending it medical authority and invoking the public's trust in doctors to trick them into giving up their DNA as part of a wartime intelligence operation. This program was conducted in total violation of medical ethics , using a doctor and a fictitious vaccination program to trick people into giving up their DNA -- a blatant violation of human rights as well as international law. This proves that so-called 'medicine' can be used as a cover story to conduct illicit government operations with the sole purpose of ending life , not protecting life. Keep that in mind the next time you consider having a needle jabbed in your arm that the government says is 'perfectly safe' for you. That's what they told the children in Pakistan, too. Fake vaccination operations are routinely carried out for a variety of reasons Fake vaccination pushes have, of course, been routinely conducted in the USA to sell vaccine inventories that the government purchased from vaccine manufacturers. For example, even when the risk of the H5N1 swine flu was extraordinarily low, and when the vaccine itself showed near-zero efficacy in actually preventing infections, the CDC was aggressively promoting vaccination campaigns across the nation in order to get more people to buy vaccines that didn't even work ( http://www.selfnews.com/swine_flu.html ). There is also strong evidence that vaccine programs are used around the world right now as a way to reduce the population through chemically-induced infertility. Bill Gates, who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to vaccine programs in developing nations, openly describes vaccines as part of an effort to 'lower [the population] by 10 or 15 percent.' ( http://www.selfnews.com/029911_vaccines_B... ) Watch Bill Gates explain this in his own words, in a live audience presentation that's viewable at: http://www.selfnews.tv/v.asp?v=A155D11345... RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Notice a pattern? What's really interesting about all the news coming out lately is what we're learning about our own government: Through operation Fast & Furious , the U.S. government actively armed Mexican drug gangs with thousands of firearms for the purpose of causing gun violence in America ( http://www.selfnews.com/032934_ATF_illega... ). This scam has blown up in the face of U.S. federal officials, and even comedian Jon Stewart exposed the utter ridiculousness of this whole scam in a hilarious comedy bit: http://www.youtube.com/user/oversightandrefo... It is now admitted that the U.S. government conducted illegal medical experiments on Guatemalan citizens. President Obama was recently forced to apologize for the inhumane experimentation after the facts surrounding the practice become publicly known ( http://www.selfnews.com/029924_medical_ex... ). In truth, even Jonas Salk, the famous inventor of the polio vaccine, was actually engaged in illegal medical experiments conducted on mental patients ( http://www.selfnews.com/031564_Jonas_Salk... ). The DEA is well known to actually distribute narcotics as a way to keep enough drugs on the street to justify their own existence. The DEA also routinely ignores state law and conducts armed raids on legal, licensed medical marijuana facilities that are merely providing natural medicine to help ease suffering in patients ( http://www.selfnews.com/021501.html ). Now through the CIA, the U.S. government faked a city-wide vaccination campaign for the sole purpose of harvesting DNA in order to track down someone they wanted to kill. How can you trust a government that actively works against you? So here's the question: How do you know that vaccination campaigns conducted in the USA aren't being used to harvest your DNA for some nefarious purpose? How do you know federal agents aren't working against your interests and causing gun violence in America? How can you trust that vaccines aren't being used for some secret, dark purpose that hasn't been made public yet? The answer is that you can't know for sure whether any vaccination program is actually being conducted for a medical purpose versus some other secret government agenda. The idea that the U.S. government staged fake vaccination programs as an act of war is no longer a bizarre conspiracy theory: It's a documented historical fact! And if they can pull it off in Pakistan, there's no reason why they can't do the same thing in St. Louis, or Sante Fe, or Cleveland. I do not trust the federal government on anything -- and especially not on anything that matters such as the national debt, the economy, health care or public health services. The government is not primarily a provider of essential services as is widely believed. Rather, it is actively plotting against the American people through one evil campaign after another: The Wall Street bailouts, the mass expansion of money creation that devalues all our hard-earned dollars, the War in Iraq fiasco, the Fast & Furious operation that has unleashed thousands of firearms into the hands of drug gang members, the continued (inexcusable) approval of GMOs by the USDA, the betrayal of U.S. health by the FDA, and on and on. The examples just never end. Time and time again, the U.S. government has proven itself to be aligned against the freedoms, rights and even the good health of the American people . So the next time your government (CDC, FDA, etc.) tells you to go get vaccinated, think twice about the DNA harvesting operation in Pakistan. Think hard about the true motives of your government, and start asking questions about WHY the population is being so strongly coerced into taking certain actions such as receiving vaccine shots or signing up for mammograms (or psychiatric disorder screening). Virtually every government program that's advertised as being beneficial to you actually has an alternative agenda that seeks to exploit you, entrap you or otherwise trick you into giving up your money, your freedoms or your health. Big Government doesn't even pretend to serve the People anymore, it turns out. Government agents don't consider themselves servants, but rulers! They demand your obedience and your conformity. They despise truth-tellers who dare to question their corruption.

The government isn't watching it for you, folks, and if you don't look out for your own interests, you will very quickly find yourself bankrupt, hospitalized and trapped in a system of modern economic slavery that is specifically designed to make sure you never escape. Wage slaves. There's a solution to all this, however: Empowerment through education . The more you read here on selfnews, the more empowered you become to make your own choices, take charge of your own health and minimize the risk of loss from the coming economic collapse.

0," Reports of children being poisoned by lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan, have shocked the nation and for good reason. Unfortunately, the story of Flint, Michigan, isn't exactly unique. Children across the country are exposed to toxic lead everyday levels which meet and exceed those in Flint. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 'lead attacks the brain and central nervous system to cause coma, convulsions, and even death.' Severe cases like these are uncommon in the United States, but that shouldn't put people at ease. Lead exposure, even in small doses, can stymie the brain development of fetuses and children, 'resulting in reduced [IQ], behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span and increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment.' Flint is in the midst of a man-made crisis, declared the city in a press release last December. But the problem of lead poisoning is far more pervasive than just the city of Flint. In Pennsylvania, for instance, an estimated 8.5 percent of children tested had hazardous levels of lead in their blood. Other U.S. cities have higher concentrations of lead than Flint, Michigan 'In light of the Flint debacle, we wanted people to understand that water is not the only thing that's poisoning children,' Elyse Pivnick, director of environmental health for Isles, Inc., told sources. 'Most people think the lead problem was solved when we took lead out of gasoline and new homes in the 1970s, but that's not true.' It's not just a problem in Pennsylvania either. In New Jersey, for example, communities with high concentrations of lead include Irvington, East Orange, Trenton, Newark, Paterson, Plainfield, Jersey City, Elizabeth, Atlantic City, New Brunswick and Passaic and Cumberland counties, reports NJ.com . According to a 2014 batch of statistics from the New Jersey Department of Health, eleven cities and two counties in New Jersey had a greater percentage of children with elevated lead levels than children in Flint did in 2015. Furthermore, data gathered by the CDC found that more than 40 percent of the states that provided lead test results in 2014 had higher rates of lead poisoning in children than in Flint. Approximately 4 percent of children five years of age or younger had blood-lead levels of at least five micrograms per deciliter in Flint , which is the threshold that requires public health action. Outside of Michigan, twelve states had a greater percentage of children under six who met and beat that threshold. Sources of lead poisoning Lead poisoning isn't solely caused by tainted water. In fact, unlike in Flint, Michigan, most cases of lead poisoning come from exposure to the air and household products. Homes built prior to 1978 the year lead was banned from paint still have lead paint coated on their window sills. Whenever these windows are opened, they release clouds of lead-contaminated dust into the air. These pollutants are breathed in by children , causing long-term damage to both the brain and bodily organs. The CDC estimates that around 24 million household units have deteriorated lead paint and dangerous levels of lead-contaminated dust. More than four million of these units are home to children. Pennsylvania is fourth in the country for having the most home units built prior to 1978. The greatest threat of lead poisoning in the United States, however, stems from inner city soil infested with decades old gasoline. Gas became unleaded in the mid-1970s. Before then, all the lead burned was released into the air and fell back down to Earth. Since lead particles don't biodegrade, they mixed with the soil. This lead accumulated in the centers of major cities, where heavy traffic was and is still commonplace. 'Flint is an anomaly because they screwed up so badly with the water ,' Matt Milcarek, a city commissioner in Kalamazoo, Mich., said to MLive . 'But lead in the home is what's poisoning our children. It makes me nervous that everyone is focused on water right now, and so people may test their water and think they're safe, when they may not even be remotely safe [from lead].' The amount of lead infested soil has become so bad that the District of Columbia's Department of Energy recommends parents 'cover any bare soil' in their backyards that their kids could be exposed to. Pets can roll around in backyard soil and bring it into the household as well. These recommendations only go so far, however. There are no citywide programs that will or can provide every backyard with an immovable blanket. The Department of Parks and Recreation has covered up soil at city playgrounds so that children are not exposed to the contaminated dirt. However, many Parks and Recreation Departments are headed by the National Park Service, which neither covers its soil nor tests it for lead.

Sketching a picture of America's lead crisis Truth be told, there isn't much research on lead levels for the majority of U.S. cities. Most cities do not have the local researchers necessary to conduct such research. Although the full-extent of America's lead problem is unknown, it's far worse than is generally recognized. In order to sketch a more accurate picture of the problem at hand, food scientist Mike Adams , and a former NASA contract scientist, are conducting a nationwide scientific analysis of heavy metals in the tap water of U.S. cities. 'In the spirit of citizen science and the democratization of science, we are taking on this task because the EPA has failed the citizens of Flint, Michigan,' explains Adams. 'When government regulators refuse to do their jobs, it is the duty and responsibility of citizen scientists to take on that task in the public interest. The health and lives of millions of children are at stake,' Adams continues. 'We don't have time to wait for the EPA to someday decide to do its job. We need to protect our children right now.' The team is calling on health professionals throughout the country to send tap water samples to their lab for testing. A downloadable form (PDF) with instructions is available at EPAwatch.org .

0," One of the fastest rising health conditions in the US is hypothyroidism. The most common symptoms experienced are lethargy, depression and weight gain. Some of the newest reports are estimating that 15-30% of the population may have thyroid problems. Heal your thyroid with natural compounds that support the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals and thyroid. 80% of hypothyroid conditions in the US are thought to be auto-immune conditions. Few doctors test for thyroid antibodies and so most do not ever get the proper diagnosis. In the medical system, an autoimmune condition and a sluggish thyroid are treated the same, with synthetic T4. Because the treatment is the same, most doctors do not concern themselves with testing for thyroid antibodies. From a natural health perspective it is especially important to understand if it is a sluggish thyroid, a sluggish liver or pituitary gland, elevated sex hormones or if it is an autoimmune condition that is the causal factor. Hypothalamic - pituitary- adrenal-thyroid axis: The body works through a series of feedback loops. One of the major chemical sensory regions of the body is the hypothalamus of the brain. This region is constantly monitoring the blood stream for the presence of adequate thyroid hormone, among other things. The hypothalamus sends chemical signals to the pituitary gland. In response, the pituitary glands send out varying amounts of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to direct the thyroid gland to produce and secrete thyroid hormone (T4). Additionally, the pituitary signals the adrenals to secrete cortisol when blood sugar goes down and/or the body is under stress. Iodine: Iodine is critical for thyroid hormone production in the body. A true iodine deficiency will cause hypothyroidism. (1) In western culture we often see subclinical iodine deficiencies which contribute to hypothyroidism. (2) Tyrosine: L-Tyrosine is the key amino acid for the production of thyroid hormones. This provides the necessary raw material for the formation of the backbone of thyroid hormone. Zinc & copper: Low zinc status has been shown to compromise T3 production. Zinc plays an important role in immune modulation which may reduce thyroid antibody levels. (3) Additionally, it is a key player in 5'deiodinase activity. Copper is also important for healthy thyroid function. It stimulates the thyroid and protects the body against too much thyroxine in the blood. (4) Copper controls the levels of calcium in the blood, which is necessary for absorption of minerals and permeability of cell membranes. Chromium: A chromium deficiency can lead to an imbalance in blood sugar levels. Blood sugar imbalances overtax the HPA Axis which effects the HPT axis and thyroid function. Nutrient support to stabilize blood sugar and adrenal function is especially important for good thyroid health . (5) Studies have shown that chromium picolinate can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine. Individuals with hypothyroidism who are taking synthetic thyroid hormone should be sure not to take chromium picolinate within four hours of taking thyroid hormone. (6) Bladderwrack extract: Bladderwrack is a form of kelp that has been used medicinally for centuries. The main use of the herb has been for the stimulation of the thyroid gland as a treatment for obesity and cellulite. The high iodine content of the herb stimulates thyroid function, which boosts metabolism. Irish moss: Irish moss, also known as sea moss, grows on rocks close to the shore in the Atlantic ocean and Caribbean sea. It is a rich source of iodine and other trace minerals that support healthy thyroid function. Rubidium: Rubidium assists in the transport of tyrosine into the thyroid for thyroxine production. This is key for healthy thyroid hormone production. "
0," The Obama Administration could not build a functional health insurance exchange website despite spending a mind-boggling $2.1 billion of taxpayer money, but now feels it is capable of essentially managing the entire Internet. On February 26, a small group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats -- three, to be exact -- voted to give the federal government the instant authority to reclassify the Internet from a free, uninhibited mode of communication and commerce into a 'public utility' the same as your old phone company, so it can now be 'better regulated' -- and all under the phony guise of making everything more 'fair.' Now, when Comcast or Verizon provide services to your home, they will have to do so 'in the public interest,' whatever that means. In a partisan move, the Federal Communications Commission's two Democrat members and its Democrat chairman voted to approve the new reclassification and associated rules over the objections of the panel's two Republican members. As Fox News and other media reported, the rules remained secret right up to the vote, though one member, Republican Ajit Pai, tried to sound the alarm about the bogus nature of the plan -- and against FCC panel rules -- in the days before the vote . Nothing is broken In an interview with Reason magazine online, Pai called the so-called 'Net Neutrality' rules a 'solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.' 'Nowhere in the 332-page document that I've received will anyone find the FCC detailing any kind of systemic harm to consumers, and it seems to me that should be the predicate for certainly any kind of preemptive regulation--some kind of systemic problem that requires an industry-wide solution,' Pai said. 'That simply isn't here.' A report by Investor's Business Daily noted that the FCC has been down this road before, and has been slapped by the federal court which hears regulatory cases: Neutrality rules have barred ISPs from blocking or purposely slowing down Internet traffic. But a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January 2014 gutted much of the FCC's authority. It's not clear how the court would view the new rules, but what is certain is that the big telecoms are sure to challenge them. Still, the public remains largely unaware of the scope of the new rules and just what Net Neutrality is. As some media have reported, grassroots support is high, but that's odd because, as Ars Technica pointed out, with the exception of the FCC commissioners, no one knows what the rules actually say. 'The full net neutrality order has not been published yet,' the website noted. 'A solution that won't work' There is also substantial criticism over the issue of President Obama interfering with the function of what is supposed to be an independent commission. 'Let me start by issuing apologies. First, I am just sick about what Chairman Wheeler was forced to go through during this process. It was disgraceful to have the Administration overtake the commission's rulemaking process and dictate an outcome for pure political purposes,' wrote Republican Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, in a dissent. 'It is so disturbing to know that those efforts were about illegitimately pushing a larger political cause mostly unrelated to technology. This administration went so far beyond what has ever been attempted, and its inappropriate interference in the commission's activities will forever change this institution,' O'Rielly added. Both of the Republican commissioners have predicted that the new Net Neutrality rules, which are scheduled to take effect in 60 days barring a legal challenge, will fail to accomplish what the administration and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler say they will do. 'What doesn't make sense, and has never made sense, is to take a regulatory framework developed for Ma Bell in the 1930s and make her great grandchildren, with technologies and options undreamed of eighty years ago, live under it,' Jim Cicconi, AT&T;'s senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs, told USA Today in a statement.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Lavender is one of the most popular herbs of all and an asset to any herb garden. Used for centuries for its sedative, antiseptic and insect repelling properties, lavender can also be used in cooking and baking. Try lavender to combat seasonal coughs and sore throats. There are many different species of the lavender plant, such as English lavender (lavandula angustifolia), L. vera, L. spica and French lavender (Lavandula dentata). Spike lavender (L. latifolia) is particularly fragrant. Lavender honey for coughs A home-made cough syrup made with lavender flowers and raw honey makes a soothing, natural remedy for coughs. Honey should not be given to children younger than a year, so reserve this for older children and adults. Take a cup of honey and add 2 tablespoons of lavender flowers. Allow to stand for 2 days, and then strain the honey into a glass jar. When coughing is severe, take a teaspoon or two of the lavender honey mixture. Lavender essential oil for coughs and flu Added in a vaporizer, lavender essential oil can help to combat coughs and colds. It is also useful for other respiratory problems such as throat infections, flu, tonsillitis, laryngitis and/or sinus congestion. In addition to vaporizers and inhalers, a few drops of lavender oil can be rubbed directly on the chest, neck or back or be diluted first using a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil. Try adding 2 - 4 drops of lavender oil in a basin of boiling water and inhale the vapors for headaches or congestion. Add 6 - 8 drops of therapeutic grade lavender essential oil to bath water to aid aching muscles and fatigue. As with many other essential oils, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using lavender essential oil. Lavender tea for headaches, fatigue and stress Lavender tea is useful to relieve headaches and exhaustion, promote sleep and relieve anxiety. Pour 250ml (1 cup) of boiling water over 2 fresh lavender sprays or 2 - 4 teaspoons lavender flowers stripped of their stems. Allow to stand for five minutes. Strain and sweeten with raw honey if desired. Home made lavender water mouthwash Lavender water makes an excellent mouthwash. Simply boil 2 cups of lavender flowers in water, cool and strain. Place the flowers in a jar and cover with 300ml of apple cider vinegar. Leave for a week, strain the liquid through muslin and discard the lavender flowers; then, bottle.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A new Israeli study has found that pomegranate juice could be a heart-healthy drink for diabetics, despite the fruit's high sugar concentration. The researchers' small human trial -- published in the August issue of the journal Atherosclerosis -- examined 10 diabetics and 10 healthy control subjects for three months, during which the diabetics were administered fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice from handpicked fruit. At the study's end, the researchers found that the juice did not affect blood sugar levels, cholesterol or triglycerides, but did significantly reduce serum lipid peroxide levels by 56 percent and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels by 28 percent. TBARS is a measure of the oxidation levels of LDL cholesterol, which can eventually lead to atherosclerosis and heart disease. The study's authors concluded that 'pomegranate juice consumption by diabetic patients did not worsen the diabetic parameters, but rather resulted in anti-oxidative effects on serum and macrophages, which could contribute to attenuation of atherosclerosis development in these patients.' Lead researcher Professor Michael Aviram says he was surprised to find that the sugars contained in pomegranate juice did not worsen diabetes parameters, such as blood sugar, as other fruit sugars do. 'In most juices, sugars are present in free -- and harmful -- forms,' says Aviram. 'In pomegranate juice, however, the sugars are attached to unique antioxidants, which actually make these sugars protective against atherosclerosis.' 'What this study clearly demonstrates is that not all sugars have the same effect on the body, as is often claimed by the processed food industry,' said Mike Adams, author of How to Halt Diabetes in 25 Days. 'Natural fruit sugars are far healthier than processed, refined sugars, even if they both have the same statistics on the nutrition facts label,' he said. 'And pomegranate juice is emerging as a natural medicine with remarkable abilities. If it were a drug instead of a fruit, drug companies would be announcing a breakthrough discovery.' Recent studies on pomegranate juice's positive effects on heart health, prostate cancer and arthritis have led to a boom in retail sales of the juice, which has seen a 300 percent sales increase in the UK since the start of 2005. ### "
0," Tweet Thirty-nine medical, health and seniors organizations are urging Congress to stop the advertising of prescription drugs to consumers, Commercial Alert and the National Womens Health Network announced today. Prescription drug ads are dishonest and dangerous, said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert. They hype the benefits and cloak the risks of prescription drugs. As Robert A. Schoellhorn, former chairman of Abbott Laboratories warned more than two decades ago, We believe direct advertising to the consumer introduces a very real possibility of causing harm to patients who may respond to advertisements by pressuring physicians to prescribe medications that may not be required. We agree. We would add that the possibility of creating another Vioxx catastrophe has only grown since then, Ruskin said. Amy Allina, program director of the National Womens Health Network, points out that history has proved regulation of direct-to-consumer ads to be inadequate to protect consumers. The ad campaigns promoting hormone therapy to women at menopause were a triumph of marketing over science. Drug companies ducked and weaved around the regulations for truth in advertising, touting unproven benefits for their menopause drugs which exposed millions of women to breast cancer and heart disease risks with little or no benefit to many. The groups are now seeking Members of Congress to introduce legislation in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to stop direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription drug ads. The following organizations have endorsed the Public Health Protection Act, which would end DTC prescription drug advertising, and are asking Congress to enact it: Action Alliance of Senior Citizens of Greater Philadelphia, Action Coalition for Media Education, Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, Alliance for Human Research Protection, American Medical Student Association, Breast Cancer Action, California Chapter of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, Center for a New American Dream, Center for Justice & Democracy, Commercial Alert, Congress of California Seniors, Connecticut Alliance for Retired Americans, Connecticut Citizen Action Group, Consumer Project on Technology, DES Action USA, Essential Action, Florida Alliance for Retired Americans, Florida CHAIN, Government Accountability Project, Gray Panthers, Health Care For All, Healthcare-NOW, Health Education AIDS Liaison-NYC (HEAL), Just Health Care, Justice in Michigan, Maine Council of Senior Citizens-Alliance for Retired Americans (MCSC-ARA), Maryland NOW, Massachusetts Breast Cancer Coalition, Massachusetts Senior Action Council, Minnesota COACT, Missouri Chapter American College of Physicians, National Womens Health Network, Nevada Alliance for Retired Americans, New View Campaign for Womens Sexual Problems (FSD-Alert.org), Obligation Inc., Pennsylvanians United for Reform in Health Care (PURe-HC), Pennsylvanians United for Single Payer Healthcare (PUSH), People Against Cancer, Physicians for a National Health Program, Prescription Access Litigation Project and the Womens Health Institute.

0," Wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago, off the west coast of Canada's British Columbia, will be extinct within 10 years due to parasite contamination from fish farms, according to a study published in the journal Science . 'The impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon populations is threatened,' said lead researcher Martin Krkosek, from the University of Alberta. 'The probability of extinction is 100 percent,' Krkosek said, 'and the only question is how long it is going to take.' Researchers compared the population numbers of different groups of salmon between 1970 and the present, depending on whether they had been exposed to aquaculture salmon farms or not. Using a computer model of population change over time, the researchers were able to show that exposure to fish farms was causing population growth of wild salmon to be 'severely depressed.' The effect comes from sea lice, a parasite that naturally infects adult salmon in the open ocean. The lice infest the skin and muscle of salmon, and adult fish can carry them without suffering serious harm. Juvenile fish, however, have little defense against such infection and often become seriously sick or die as a result. 'Salmon farming breaks a natural law' by massing adult salmon in large open nets just offshore, said study co-author Alexandra Morton, director of the Salmon Coast Field Station. 'In the natural system, the youngest salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon that carry the parasite are offshore. But fish farms cause a deadly collision between the vulnerable young salmon and sea lice. They are not equipped to survive this, and they don't,' Morton said. Young wild salmon are exposed to sea lice when they swim past salmon farms on their way from rivers to the open sea. The researchers concluded that if measures are not taken to stop exposing young fish to sea lice, such as moving fish farms away from the paths of wild fish, wild salmon will be extinct in the archipelago within eight to 10 years.

0," Illegal genetically-modified (GM) wheat is not the only surprise transgenic crop being discovered unexpectedly on the commercial market. As it turns out, a long-abandoned variety of GM flax known as FP967 has reportedly been identified in at least 30 countries worldwide over the past few years, a discovery that has greatly stifled the Canadian flax market, which supplies most of the world's flax. The GM Contamination Register explains that the earliest discoveries of unapproved FP967 turned up in Germany back in late 2009. Since that time, the same illegal GM flax has turned up in Austria, Romania, Sweden, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, not to mention dozens of other mostly European countries to which the crop was also distributed. Back in the late 1980s, the publicly-funded Crop Development Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, first developed FP967, which was later renamed Triffid, specifically for the commercial market. The 'Frankencrop' was later authorized in the late 1990s for commercial use both in Canada and the U.S., that is until concerns about the safety of the crop by the European export market prevented Triffid from ever actually being produced and sold for commercial production. Discovery of transient GM flax proves agricultural coexistence is impossible By 2001, Triffid was officially de-registered, and all known stocks of the seed were believed to have been identified and destroyed. But this was apparently not the case. Triffid is still showing up in flax stocks more a decade later, which calls into question the integrity of the entire global supply of flax. This just goes to show that, once released, even test runs of GM crops can lead to lasting and potentially even permanent damage to the food supply. 'There is no peaceful coexistence [between pharma crops and conventional],' said Ernie Hoffert, manager of Reimers Seed Co., which supplies organic flax seeds to farmers, to The Organic & Non-GMO Report in a 2006 piece on flax. '[Biotech companies] say they are going to save agriculture, but they could cause tremendous problems with local economies and markets.' Hoffert's statements were eventually proven true by the revelation of GM flax contamination in Europe roughly three years later. And though both the Canadian government and the biotechnology groups responsible for unleashing Frankenflax on the world tried to pay lip service to the idea of containing this contamination and getting the Canadian flax market back on its feet, it appears as though the damage has already been done, and may be irreversible. 'GE contamination is already costing the taxpayer,' explained Lucy Sharratt, Coordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network , in a 2010 press release following the initial discovery. 'Contamination is inevitable and these costs will keep recurring.' Always verify the integrity of your flax with the manufacturer At this point, the best thing consumers, and especially those in Europe, can do is stick with certified organic and non-GMO varieties of flax seed and oil that have been tested by their manufacturers and verified to be clean. If a company cannot or refuses to provide information about the genetic status of its flax, avoid it and find another brand that has been fully tested for purity and integrity. "
0," Tweet Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) who took part in hypnotherapy sessions reported reduced symptoms and improved quality of life, according to research published in the June issue of Journal of Clinical Nursing. Dr Graeme D Smith from University of Edinburgh studied 75 patients with IBS - which affects up to one in seven adults - before and after they took part in four to five treatment sessions over three months. He discovered that before the sessions, women were most concerned with quality of life issues such as diet and energy and that men had the highest levels of anxiety and depression and worried about their physical role. The 20 men and 55 women who took part in the study reported that hypnotherapy brought about significant improvements in the physical and emotional symptoms related to IBS. These included a 30 per cent improvement in their emotional quality of life and a 25 per cent improvement in energy levels. Mental health improved by 21 per cent, sleep by 18 per cent, physical health by 16 per cent and diet by 14 per cent. The participants also reported that their social role had improved by 20 per cent and their physical role by 18 per cent. Average anxiety levels fell by 12 per cent and depression fell by four per cent. Men showed higher levels of both problems before the hypnotherapy sessions, but also reported greater improvements than women. The people taking part in the study also reported a five per cent reduction in abdominal pain and a four per cent reduction in abdominal bloating. 'It is estimated that between 10 to 15 per cent of adults may suffer from IBS and that the physical, emotional, social and economic consequences of the illness can be considerable' says Dr Smith, from the University's School of Health (Nursing Studies). 'Physical symptoms include altered bowel habits, abdominal pain and bloating, together with other non-intestinal problems such as lethargy, problems sleeping and indigestion. Anxiety and psychosocial problems are also common and these can have a detrimental impact on quality of life.' The 75 study participants underwent hypnotherapy sessions that focussed on creating images of their gut symptoms using visualisation techniques in conjunction with relaxation methods. Self-hypnosis was taught at an early stage and patients were given audio tapes, that reinforced the effects of the hypnotherapy, to use at home. They also completed detailed questionnaires before and after treatment and kept diary cards during the study 'The patients involved in this study were typical of people seen routinely in gastroenterology clinics, where up to 50 per cent of the referrals are for IBS' says Dr Smith. 'There's no universal agreement about what causes IBS and traditional treatment is often disappointing. This study shows that hypnotherapy can effectively reduce symptoms and improve quality of life and underlines the valuable role that complementary therapies can play in modern healthcare.' "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Acupressure has become increasingly popular in the west in recent years, though it has been used for centuries as a natural treatment for various diseases. A traditional technique of Chinese medicine, it is similar to acupuncture but less known. The underlying theory is that there is an invisible force or energy, called qi in Chinese, which has healing power. There are many points, called acupoints or meridians, which connect to the glands of the body. In therapy, pressure is applied at specific points to increase the flow of the qi, in and around the body through the point network. Pressuring acupoints ensures normal qi circulation. Once a therapist diagnoses a particular ailment by acupressure, he or she provides some acupoints to the patient. Self-applied acupressure is a free treatment which is quick and effective in providing relief from many disorders, a unique advantage. Its effectiveness increases with regular treatment, including self-treatment. The wellness benefits of acupressure are many. Creating a sense of well-being, it helps provide relief from problems due to stress and tiredness. It helps the body heal its injuries, increases blood circulation, releases muscle tension and reduces back pain. Some of the diseases or disorders that have been mitigated by acupressure include diabetes, epilepsy, bronchitis, heart problems, digestive problems and many allergies. Relief of eye strain, sinus problems, arthritis, muscle aches, ulcer pain, menstrual cramps, nausea, constipation and indigestion have been reported. Acupressure can help in inducing pain-free labor during pregnancy and has been used in lieu of pain killers for minor surgery. Acupressure has also been used to decrease swelling in the lower body caused by water retention. Massaging certain acupoints on the legs, feet and ankles helps to relieve such swelling by eliminating dampness; it can also help to strengthen the spleen and kidneys. This is important because these are the organs responsible for ensuring the right body fluid balance. There is some anecdotal evidence that the swelling may be lessened by utilizing a 'porcupine ball', an exercise ball covered with spiked bumps. These bumps provide pressure to the body part massaged by the ball. In addition, there are abundant wood and plastic hand and foot massagers and other devices with pointed nubs to help a person treat himself. More study of the efficacy of such tools is needed, however. Several techniques, or types of pressure, are used depending on the particular needs of a patient`s disorder. These vary from firm pressure to the more aggressive kneading of the muscles. Keep in mind that acupressure , like other Chinese medicine protocols, does not cure disease, but it works by bringing the body`s qi into a better flow, thus enabling the body to heal itself. It is also thought that a disruption in the qi flow can actually cause the problem, so restoring the flow ends the discomfort. Several precautions must be taken before stimulating any point. Acupressure should be avoided after heavy exercise, meals and bathing, and if pregnant. Prescription drugs might interfere with the treatment . Also, if under treatment for cancer or high blood pressure, the doctor`s supervision is necessary. If care is taken to follow the precautions, acupressure can be an adjunct to treatment or a self- administered help for many common complaints. Its non-invasive quality allows people to use it for free, anywhere, anytime. Even though its more illustrious relative, acupuncture, has been more fully researched and implemented, acupressure offers one alternative to try before opting for acupuncture. Depending on the complaint, it may be all that is needed. Sources: http://www.acupressureinstitute.com/ http://med.stanford.edu/personal/pointfinder... http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/acupress...

Some are fast-food eateries with counters for ordering, and others are traditional sit-down table service restaurants. Probably McDonalds is the most well-known fast-food chain, but dozens of other chains dot the landscape of towns and cities throughout America. (Story by John P. Thomas, republished from HealthImpactNews.com .) As of 2012, there were 263,944 fast food restaurants in America with a combined revenue of well over $100 billion. [1] If we set aside all the reasons for eating in specific fast-food restaurants, and only focus on the quality of food that is served, then where should we eat? Which restaurants offer the least toxic food? It might appear that we have dozens of choices, but this is actually an illusion. The difference between one fast-food restaurant and the next is negligible when considering the high levels of toxic ingredients that are in the food. Restaurant Cooking used to be just like Home Cooking When people traveled across America in the first half of the twentieth century up through the 1960s, they would have found numerous diners or mom & pop restaurants of one kind or another. These restaurants featured regionally authentic recipes that matched what people cooked in their homes. The restaurant kitchens were bigger than home kitchens, and mom & pop prepared food in larger quantities. If they had been cooking at home, the meals they prepared would have been the same, and they would have obtained the raw ingredients from the same sources. Even institutional kitchens such as hospitals and nursing homes cooked much of their food from scratch just as was done in most American homes through the 1960s. All that began to change in the 1970s as regional factory size 'kitchens' began to prepare frozen foods for wholesale distribution to hospitals, nursing homes, schools, military bases, fast-food eateries, and even some of America's most well-known restaurants. A network of food factories are now supplying most all fast-food eating establishments with ready to eat food they can defrost and serve, or with prefabricated food they can defrost, heat, and serve. Sometimes even first-class table-service restaurants may serve factory food in addition to what their chefs prepare. Don't Assume Restaurant Food is made in the Restaurant When you go out and eat meals at chain restaurants, you are most likely consuming food that was produced in a factory. This can even be the case for some independent restaurants. Food factories use assembly line technology reminiscent of automobile assembly lines. Football stadium size factories crank out 'food' products by the ton. The equipment they use and the processes they employ have no resemblance to home cooking or even to cooking that could be done in a local restaurant . Factory produced food is produced and distributed by several large companies who specialize in providing products for all types of restaurants. America's largest manufacturer of prepared food for restaurants is Sysco. This is how they describe themselves: Sysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home. Its family of products also includes equipment and supplies for the foodservice and hospitality industries. The company operates 194 distribution facilities serving approximately 425,000 customers. For Fiscal Year 2014 that ended June 28, 2014, the company generated sales of more than $46 billion.[2] Sysco is not the only source of factory food that is sold to restaurants. There are others who compete with them to provide raw food, semi-prepared food, and completely cooked food. Restaurants often receive daily deliveries of perishable and non-perishable food from these suppliers. In 1970, the commercial food service market that was served by companies such as Sysco was a 35 billion dollar per year industry. Today, it has grown to become a 255 billion dollar industry.

0," With each day's news, it is becoming more obvious that the level of corruption within the Obama Administration is legion. Worse than that, however, is the 'culture of intimidation' that now exists at virtually every level of the government under the most divisive U.S. president in history. That phrase, coined by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is extremely fitting, for it perfectly describes both the cultural rot within the federal bureaucracy - which has been building for generations as a risk-averse Congress has shirked more and more of its constitutional lawmaking power - and the dismissive arrogance of Obama and his top appointees and advisors. This culture, as noted by syndicated columnist Ben Shapiro, 'stretches from the White House down to the myriad of agencies of the executive branch,' of which Obama controls as president. Thugocracy 'From his language suggesting targeting of enemies to his officials' attempts to castigate Tea Partiers as economic terrorists, President Obama has presided over an administration that sees his political opponents as unworthy and nasty. Early in his administration, Obama threatened CEOs of banks, 'My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks',' writes Shapiro. Shapiro nails the Obama hubris but there is more. Consider the now-exploding IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative and 'patriot' groups for excessive scrutiny in the consideration of their tax-exempt status applications (many were deliberately not approved until after the Nov. 6 election). There is a pervasive hypocrisy this man harbors that borders on the obsessive. While publicly feigning disdain for the burgeoning IRS scandal and issuing platitudes to conservatives about how the nation's tax agency must remain non-partisan (though it clearly isn't nor has it ever been) what is now known is that the president, on a number of occasions, met with Colleen Kelley, a former IRS official and current president of the same union that represents IRS employees, at the White House just a day before the agency's 'Determinations Unit Program agreed' to open a 'Sensitive Case report on the Tea party cases,' according to the Justice Department's Inspector General report detailing the scandal. Coincidence? Sure . The IRS case is just one albeit large example which demonstrates clearly that when Obama cannot garner support of his agenda in traditional political fashion, he resorts to intimidation - or he lets the agencies he controls intimidate. A petulant child is a nuisance but a petulant U.S. president, with the power of the IRS, the Justice Department and a host of federal bureaucracies at his control, is dangerous. Widespread culture of corruption In his column Shapiro goes on to list the plethora of absolute criminality and pressure exerted by the Obama Administration: Regarding the DoJ and its pathetic attempt at silencing a whistleblower in the 'Fast and Furious' scandal: Today's report from the Department of Justice Inspector General, showing that former US Attorney for Arizona Dennis Burke leaked documents intended to smear a whistleblower in Fast and Furious, is only the latest revelation on misconduct from DOJ. The DOJ has also targeted: Fox News reporter James Rosen over leaks from State Department employee Stephen Jin-Woo Kim; according to Megyn Kelly, two other Fox News staffers; the Associated Press , over a story regarding CIA investigations into al-Qaeda; Gallup, shortly after the polling firm showed Mitt Romney with a substantial lead over Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential race; and True the Vote, an organization dedicated to stopping voter fraud. Under Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder, the 'Justice' Department has become the modern wing of the Nazi Party's Brown Shirts, terrorizing political opponents under the color of law, all in pursuit of a radical 'agenda of change.' Once-benign departments are equally corrupt. Take the State Department. Under Obama's tutelage and Hillary Clinton's 'leadership,' America's diplomatic corps has been both radicalized and politicized to point where not even U.S. ambassadors are worthy of protection - if doing so means compromising or countering the president's precious reelection campaign narrative ( http://www.newsday.com ). Think Benghazi, and the mountain of lies told by Obama, his staffers and Clinton herself to cover up the fact that al Qaeda, indeed, is not dead. Gregory Hicks, the second-in-command in Libya from the State Department during the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks, was criticized and demoted for being too forthright with visiting House members over what really happened the fateful night Amb. Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. officials were killed. 'Too much to keep track of' At the Department of Health and Human Services , which is cranking out restrictive, byzantine and punitive regulations in preparation for Obamacare's full roll-out in 2014, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is playing the role healthcare heavy. Under the guise of the law, she is forcing religious employers to provide employees with health care coverage that includes contraceptive coverage - a provision Catholics have been fighting tooth-and-nail. 'That came on the heels of the Obama Administration agreeing to concessions to the pharmaceutical industry in return for the industry's support for Obamacare. Big Pharma eventually agreed to finance millions worth of TV advertising for Obamacare in exchange for capping liability at $80 billion over ten years,' notes Shapiro. More recently, Sebelius has been accused of illegally using her office to solicit donations from non-profit groups to push for Obamacare roll-out; these groups are directly regulated by HHS . Sebelius says she's done nothing wrong - ethically or legally. There is more corruption at the Treasury Department, FBI, Homeland Security and even the Department of the Interior. It's nearly too much to keep track of. Suffice it to say the Obama Administration doesn't care much for you or the Constitution, and it is painfully obvious in the way the president and his appointees are behaving. "
0," Jill Hennessy, the health minister of Victoria, Australia, shocked and outraged parents of vaccine-injured children recently, when she stated to Channel 10 Melbourne that, 'There are no risks in vaccinating your children.' But even the heavily pro-vaccine health establishment admits that there are risks to vaccination, as with any drug. That's why the package insert on any vaccine contains a long list of potential adverse reactions. Hennessy's statements are a classic example of throwing science out the window in service of a political agenda, and are unbecoming of a health minister. Following are just some of the many examples of science-proven vaccine side effects that Hennessy is either ignorant of, or determined to cover up. A side effect overview According to vaccine package inserts and reputable medical literature, vaccines have been linked to serious side effects, including arthritis, blood clots and bleeding, ear infections, fainting (sometimes causing injury), heart attack, kidney failure (requiring dialysis), miscarriage, seizures, sepsis, severe allergies from hives to anaphylactic shock, and sudden death. In addition, the following diseases have been linked with vaccination: chronic allergies (including asthma and eczema), arthritis, acid reflux, cancer, diabetes (in infants and children), kidney disease, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and a variety of neurological and autoimmune conditions. In the United States, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, (NVICP) has issued injury compensation awards totaling more than $1.2 billion. The following is just an overview of some of the scientifically accepted vaccine side effects. HPV vaccine: This is 'normal?' A recent article in the Danish Medical Journal reports that a small subset of women who receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination seem to develop a consistent set of neurological symptoms that do not correspond with any known disease. 'During the past years, a collection of symptoms primarily consistent with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction have been described as suspected side effects to the Q-HPV vaccine ,' the researchers wrote. Does that mean that women who don't develop this rare, still poorly understood condition are safe? Not so, says a 2009 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association . That study reviewed side effects during the first two years after the introduction of the HPV vaccine. The researchers cataloged 12,424 adverse effects, including everything from dizziness to autoimmune diseases. In addition, there were 32 deaths reported. Shockingly, the researchers declared these rates consistent with the drug safety studies, and comparable to the side effect rates of other vaccines . Diane Harper of the University of Louisville whose research was essential in the FDA approval of both HPV vaccines has now gone on record as saying that for women living in Western countries with access to yearly Pap smears, the risks of the HPV vaccine outweigh its benefits. Flu vaccine damages nervous system The worst you're likely to get from a flu shot is a mild case of the flu itself, right? Not so. In fact, the single most common injury compensated through the U.S. vaccine court is a rare autoimmune disorder known as Guillain-Barre Syndrome, triggered in this case by the seasonal flu vaccine. In Guillain-Barre Syndrome, the immune system mistakes the body's nervous system for a virus and attacks it. This can cause the destruction of the myelin sheath, causing muscular paralysis. While typically triggered by viral infection, Guillain-Barre can also come from the flu vaccine. The nervous system may be particularly vulnerable to the flu vaccine. In October 2015, the British government agreed to pay about 1 million ($1.5 million) to each of 60 people who had suffered brain damage from the swine flu vaccine for a total of $90 million. During the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the British government pushed the vaccine on 60 million people, mostly children. But this vaccine causes narcolepsy and cataplexy in one in 16,000 people. Narcolepsy results in overwhelming sleepiness during the day, sometimes causing abrupt loss of consciousness. In cataplexy, a person abruptly loses muscle function when experiencing certain emotional stimuli, such as anger, pleasure or excitement. This can cause people to collapse, for example, any time they laugh. More injured parties are expected to come forward.

The list goes on This is all just the tip of the iceberg. Evidence continues to emerge of a link between autism and vaccines that has been actively covered up by governments and drug companies for decades. Widespread adoption of the chicken pox vaccine seems to have led to an increase in shingles, in a direct effect of national vaccination, if not technically a side effect of the vaccine itself. The effects can be even more dire. Between 2006 and 2008, more than 70 children in the Chinese province of Shanxi developed severe side effects after being given vaccines that had not been stored at the proper temperature. A further four children died. And according to California mother Crystal Downing, her infant son died after being vaccinated against eight different diseases in six different vaccine shots in a single day. One of the vaccines was for Hepatitis A. This shot is not supposed to be given to children under a year of age. "
0," Tweet A common additive found in food and cosmetics has been found to inhibit the activity of sirtuins, enzymes associated with lifespan control in yeast and other organisms, according to a new study led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The study, to be published Friday, Dec. 16, in the online journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) Genetics, found that in lab tests, dihydrocoumarin (DHC), a compound found naturally in sweet clover and synthetically manufactured for use in foods and cosmetics, inhibited the activity of Sir2p and SIRT1, forms of sirtuin found in yeast and humans, respectively. Increased sirtuin activity is known to increase longevity in yeast, roundworms and fruit flies. The opposite effect in yeast has also been shown when the sirtuin enzyme is either deleted or reduced - the lifespan decreases by as much as 30 percent. 'Although studies on sirtuins and longevity have not been done in humans, there is reason to suspect that sirtuins play a role in the aging process of human cells, so identifying sirtuin inhibitors becomes important,' said Martyn Smith, professor of toxicology at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study, which was funded by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. DHC is added as a flavoring agent to a wide variety of foods, including soft drinks, yogurt and muffins, and is used as a common fragrance in cosmetics, lotions and soaps. It can be found in concentrations as high as 100 parts per million in such foods as gelatins, puddings and frozen dairy products. 'It's still a long jump from test tube to person, but our findings may imply that humans are exposed to chemicals in the diet and environment that block an important enzyme involved in longevity,' said Smith. Notably, there are five forms of sirtuins found in yeast, and seven forms of sirtuin in humans. 'There is good reason to think that DHC would inhibit at least some of the functions of some of the other forms of sirtuins,' said Jasper Rine, professor of genetics at UC Berkeley's Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and co-author of the paper. The UC Berkeley researchers collaborated with Dr. Eric Verdin, associate director and senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, which is affiliated with UC San Francisco. Verdin, who is also a professor of medicine at UCSF, is an expert on mammalian sirtuin enzymes. 'It's important to note that the role of sirtuins in aging is conserved in distantly related organisms such as yeast, drosophila and the small roundworm, C. elegans,' said Verdin. 'So, it is not too much of a stretch to expect that sirtuins also control the aging process in mammals, including humans. In addition, sirtuins control many important cellular functions besides aging, and an agent that modulates sirtuins, such as DHC, could not only affect aging but also other critical functions, such as metabolism, neurodegeneration and cancer.' Sirtuin enzymes are histone deacetylases, which modify the structure of chromatins, complex substances made up of DNA and protein. Histone deacetylases keep chromatins packed and tightly coiled in such a way that enzymes cannot activate the DNA, keeping the gene from being expressed. This type of gene 'silencing' is considered epigenetic, which means that it effectively controls the expression of a gene without altering the actual DNA molecules. 'Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for nearly all aspects of development and have been implicated in a variety of human diseases,' said Rine. 'Hence, agents which disrupt epigenetic processes can have profound consequences.' Andrew Olaharski, UC Berkeley post-doctoral researcher in environmental health sciences and lead author of the paper, noted that toxicology testing routinely focuses on an agent's ability to cause DNA mutations, chromosome alterations, or cell death, but does not currently test for chemical-induced epigenetic changes. While epigenetic changes do not alter the DNA structure, they can impact gene expression that may lead to disease. 'Identical twins with the exact same DNA may grow up to have different diseases because of epigenetic changes,' said Olaharski. 'The identification that a common additive to foods and cosmetics may interfere with these epigenetic processes is simply one more piece of evidence supporting the important role environmental agents may play in human health.' To screen for possible sirtuin inhibitors, the researchers used haploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. The haploid yeast strains, like gametes or sex cells, contained only one set of chromosomes, and would not normally grow on the medium prepared in the lab. However, if the haploid yeast strains were exposed to an agent that disrupted sirtuin activity, epigenetic silencing would be reversed, the strains would mate to become diploid cells, and the yeast would grow on the medium. Of the compounds tested thus far, DHC was the first environmental agent to have shown the ability to inhibit sirtuin enzymes. The researchers further tested the role of DHC in apoptosis, a process that causes a cell to die. They exposed DHC to human white blood cells and found that increasing concentrations of the compound led to increases in cell toxicity, apoptosis, and the stability of p53, a tumor-suppressing protein associated with apoptosis. 'Our study raises some concern about the potential effects of DHC on humans,' said Olaharski. 'However, I would not be alarmed at this point, since we currently do not have any evidence that exposure to DHC in the diet accelerates the human aging process.' Olaharski said the findings highlight an emerging hypothesis regarding the delicate balance a cell must strike between tumor growth and aging. 'Cancers and tumors are essentially cells that have uncontrolled or accelerated growth,' he said. 'In contrast, aging and apoptosis are processes involved in the halting of cell growth and eventually cell death. If there is too much tumor suppression, there may be no cancer, but the tissue may age more rapidly. It is interesting to speculate whether DHC present in the diet tips this balance towards enhanced tumor suppression, and on the potential ramifications this may have on human health.' The trick, researchers say, is to suppress tumor growth without triggering an acceleration of the aging process. The study suggests that properly functioning sirtuin enzymes - and the agents that inhibit or activate them - play a key role in that balance.

0," Experts are increasingly pushing for higher daily recommended intakes of vitamin D, saying that while current amounts may prevent signs of deficiency, they are insufficient to provide a protective benefit against cancer. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient produced by the body when ultraviolet radiation from sunlight strikes the skin. In northern latitudes, however, when sunlight is dim for significant parts of the year, many people cannot get enough sun to synthesize sufficient levels of the vitamin. This problem is particularly pronounced among those with darker skin. Few foods are rich in vitamin D. Fish oil and fortified food sources, such as milk or non-dairy milk substitutes, provide the most common dietary sources. The United States and Canadian governments recommend a daily vitamin D intake of 200 IU. But vitamin D and cancer experts warn that this value is far too low. Recently, the Canadian Cancer Society advised that light-skinned people take a 1,000 IU vitamin D supplement daily during fall and winter months, and that dark-skinned people or those who regularly keep all their skin covered while outdoors take a supplement year-round. 'We're recommending 1,000 IU daily because the current evidence suggests this amount will help reduce cancer risk with the least potential for harm,' said Heather Logan, director of the society's Cancer Control Policy. 'I have to commend the Canadian Cancer Society,' vitamin D researcher Joan Lappe said. 'They're right out in the lead there on changing the recommendations.' Lappe was lead researcher in a recent study that found that women taking 1,100 IU of vitamin D per day showed a 60 percent reduced risk of developing cancer than women taking a placebo. Excluding women who developed cancer during the first year of the four-year study, the risk reduction from vitamin D was 77 percent. In a paper published in the 'American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,' a group of vitamin D experts recently advised that an upper daily limit of 10,000 IU be set for vitamin D exposure, making a break with the current, more cautious, government recommendations.

0," Despite recent blowback from the American people over so-called 'sanctuary city' policies, in which local officials conspire against federal immigration authorities to ensure that illegal immigrants are not rounded up and deported, other cities are working to implement similar policies, all while the Obama administration looks the other way and refuses to enforce existing immigration laws. Now, according to the The Gazette , activists in Iowa are working to turn Iowa City and Cedar Rapids into sanctuaries for illegal immigrants, just days after an undocumented migrant shot and killed a 32-year-old American woman in San Francisco, perhaps the original 'sanctuary city.' The migrant, 45-year-old Francisco Sanchez, had been deported five times and was in custody as recently as March, but San Francisco authorities released him, citing the city's policy. 'We want people to be able to participate in the community without fear,' Karla Stoltzfus Detweiler, a Mennonite pastor involved in requesting that Iowa City to officially ignore the illegal status of undocumented migrants, told the paper. So much for law and order Meanwhile, in nearby Cedar Rapids, the effort is emerging out of a class struggle, according to advocate Marlon Pierre-Antoine, a Haitian-American leading the sanctuary city movement there. 'The working class cannot win the struggle against the ruling class unless it is united,' said Pierre-Antoine, 20, an organizer for SocialistAction, a group that wants a world without borders and immediate citizenship for all immigrants. If one or both Iowa cities decide to defy federal law and become sanctuary cities, they would join some 200 other U.S. cities where progressive city officials have made similar choices [see map here ]. The map was part of a recent effort by the Centers for Immigration Studies to highlight the growing number of communities that have elected to essentially place their residents at greater risk of criminal action from people who are not even supposed to be in the country. 'More than 200 cities, counties and states across the United States are considered sanctuary cities,' CIS says on its web site . 'These state and local jurisdictions have policies, laws, executive orders, or regulations allowing them to avoid cooperating with federal immigration law enforcement authorities. These 'cities' ignore federal law authorizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to administratively deport illegal aliens without seeking criminal warrants or convictions from federal, state, or local courts.' What makes Iowa so important to critics of sanctuary city policies is that the state is home to the earliest of election primaries; by allowing more immigrants, illegal and otherwise, to settle there undisturbed, eventually the demographics will favor the progressive socialists. 'One could also argue that any jurisdiction that provides drivers licenses, or welfare benefits, or public housing, or municipal ID cards is a sanctuary,' Jessica Vaughan, CIS director of policy studies, said, adding that would push the number to well over 300. Following the murder in San Francisco of Kate Steinle, 32, some lawmakers are recommending or pursuing legislative options such as cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities and instituting mandatory jail terms for repeat illegal border crossers. Just say no and Texas should lead the way But in the great scheme of things, too many 'opposition' Republicans won't fight President Obama on issues like amnesty for illegal aliens, or could not muster up enough support to overcome an expected veto of legislation cutting federal funds to such cities. The only real option, then, is to treat federal law like many other states and cities are doing: Ignore it and dare the administration to try selectively enforcing them. Texas, known for its independent streak, should lead the way. The Texas Legislature and Gov. Greg Abbott should immediately nullify all federal gun laws, ignore federal laws prohibiting recreational pot use like Colorado and Washington have done, wave off federal and Supreme Court rulings like the administration does and just dare the Obama regime to step in. No doubt, this vindictive White House would try to do so Obama's Justice Department has sued 'red states' often while ignoring wrongdoing in blue 'progressive' states but Texas could and should hold firm. And who knows? Maybe other states would do the same and join in with Texas. Lawlessness should never be the first option in a country that supposedly values law and order, but when an administration becomes so selective, so vindictive and even lackadaisical with the enforcement of federal statutes to the point where it is costing Americans their lives what other choice do states have?

0," Does work stress you out? Unless you're lucky enough to be the exception, work is probably one of your leading sources of stress, primarily because it's a root cause nearly impossible to eliminate. Scientists working for the German Research Center for Environmental Health discovered a strong correlation between stress-related work and type 2 diabetes, according to the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen (HMGU). A team of experts headed by Dr. Cornelia Huth and Prof. Karl-Heinz Ladwig, with the HMGU, concluded that individuals under high levels of pressure at work, with the perception of having little control over their activities, are 45 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those experiencing lower stress levels. Type 2 diabetes results in the body being unable to use insulin properly. It causes your blood sugar levels to rise higher than normal, preventing your body from producing enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Simply reducing your stress at work can pay off, big time . While some are able to successfully recover from type 2 diabetes through weight loss and a healthy diet (Mike Adams is a perfect example), others aren't so lucky and suffer from the condition for a lifetime. Published in the scientific journal Psychosomatic Medicine , their research found that what increased one's chance of type 2 diabetes was not just any type of stress but high levels of stress in individuals who had no control over their work situations, having 'little scope for maneuver or for decision making.' The conclusions are based on more than 13 years of research collected from at least 5,300 employed individuals with ages ranging from 29 to 66 years old. The population-based study, known as MONICA/KORA, analyzed healthy participants who had no known history of diabetes . Following the post-observation period, which lasted an average of 13 years, almost 300 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. 'The increase in risk in work-related stress was identified independently of classic risk factors such as obesity, age or gender,' stated the researchers' press release. Scientists from the Institute of Epidemiology II at the HMGU in collaboration with Prof. Johannes Kruse from the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg discovered that roughly one in five people suffered from high levels of mental stress at work . By 'high levels of mental stress,' researchers emphasized that this is not your typical level of work-related stress but situations in which individuals ranked the demands put on them as 'very high.' 'In view of the huge health implications of stress-related disorders, preventive measures to prevent common diseases such as diabetes should therefore also begin at this point,' noted Prof. Ladwig. The German Environmental Health center partnered with the German Center for Diabetes Research to develop new approaches for diagnosing, treating and preventing diabetes, one of the most common diseases afflicting developed countries. Stress has repeatedly been documented to induce a range of other health complications affecting the body both physically and mentally Physical complications stemming from stress include: "
0," Chronic exposure to the hazardous chemical arsenic, which is commonly found in rice, fruit juices, and even some municipal water supplies, could be severely oxidizing your blood while creating disease-causing inflammation. Based on the findings of numerous scientific studies looking at the adverse effects of arsenic, it is clear that this damaging compound obstructs the necessary activity of antioxidants in the body, including the so-called 'master antioxidant' glutathione. A recent study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reveals that exposure to arsenic (As) is directly responsible for depleting glutathione (GSH), the body's primary intracellular antioxidant, as well as inducing oxidative stress. Based on an assessment involving 378 participants, all of whom consumed varying levels of arsenic-laced water, the higher the exposure to As, the more damage sustained. For the research, a joint team based out of both the U.S. and Bangladesh tested their hypothesis that As exposure can lead to decreases in both GSH and cysteine (Cys), a semi-essential amino acid. They also presumed at the study's onset that As exposure also leads to increases in both glutathione disulfide and cystine (CySS), which are more-oxidized versions of GSH and Cys. Upon distributing varying concentrations of As dissolved in water to all the participants, the researchers noted that blood GSH levels dropped in direct proportion to the rise in As exposure. In other words, the more As a person is exposed to, the less GSH he or she will have circulating in the blood. A similar negative association was observed for CySS in blood plasma. ' In vitro and rodent studies have shown that arsenic (As) exposure can deplete glutathione (GSH) and induce oxidative stress,' wrote the authors. Two other studies, one published in the International Journal of Molecular Medicine back in 2010 , and the other published in the journal Toxicological Sciences back in 2008 , came to similar conclusions. The latter unveils a little bit more about how As interacts with and affects GSH in the body, while the former evaluates how the As derivative arsenic trioxide influences cells. Glutathione: The key to a healthy, disease-free life The reason why this is such an issue is that glutathione is the body's master detoxifier. Everything, including your immune system, the proper function of your organs and the transfer and delivery of nutrients among cells, relies upon healthy levels of glutathione , which is becoming increasingly rare as a result of poor diet, stress and exposure to toxins like As. 'Glutathione is critical for one simple reason: It recycles antioxidants,' writes Dr. Mark Hyman, M.D., for The Huffington Post . 'You see, dealing with free radicals is like handing off a hot potato. They get passed around from vitamin C to vitamin E to lipoic acid and then finally to glutathione which cools off the free radicals and recycles other antioxidants. After this happens, the body can 'reduce' or regenerate another protective glutathione molecule and we are back in business.' On the other hand, a lack of glutathione, or chronic glutathione deficiency, leads to too much oxidative stress that, if left unmitigated, eventually leads to major health problems like Alzheimer's disease and cancer. For this reason, it is crucial to take protective dietary and lifestyle steps to avoid developing a glutathione deficiency. This includes avoiding major sources of As, which the Environmental Working Group provides some tips on here , as well as taking in more glutathione. Dr. Hyman recommends consuming more sulfur-rich foods like cruciferous vegetables, as well as consuming bioactive whey protein and exercising. He provides other tips here: HuffingtonPost.com . "
0," It seems that more and more big name supermarkets have a natural foods section with natural food and products. Kroger in particular has pushed its Nature's Market, now found in more than 1,300 of the 2,500 stores nationwide. With the demand to increase market share for natural foods between competitors, it could mean good news as prices fall slowly but surely. 'Used to be this was all very faddish,' said Gregg Proctor, who heads up natural foods for Kroger's central division, which includes Indiana. 'Not anymore. We're adding new items constantly because if we don't get it when it comes out, our competition will.' According to the Nutrition Business Journal , natural food sales grew eight percent in 2010 compared to the less than one percent growth in the $630 billion total U.S. food market nationwide. It also grew, on average, by five percent every year from 2005 to 2009. Kroger in Cincinnati has made a point to focus on natural foods, which makes sense considering it has seen sales double in the last four years in this area. With those figures, it seems to be obvious there is a race to natural foods among the nation's largest grocers. Many supermarkets are ramping up promotions and offerings, even launching their own brands of natural foods and products. The benefit to the consumer of not only selection and abundance, is price. The more these large supermarkets try to compete in this sector means falling prices. 'Make no mistake, there is a definite price differential,' said Meg Major, editor-in-chief of Progressive Grocer , a trade publication covering the industry. 'But as that once small segment is growing bigger and bigger, it has not only raised awareness but affordability.' 'Our whole food culture is moving in a direction of less preservatives, less processed and just the whole ingredient count is so much more on people's minds,' Major said. The hurdle in this category: education. The difference between organic and natural can be a confusing one as natural foods are not regulated, unlike organic foods that are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Organic foods are also produced with strict rules and guidelines, holding farmers and manufacturers accountable to abide by these regulations. Not having any regulations leaves it up to the manufacturer to define the meaning of ' natural foods.' In the end, it is still up to consumers to educate themselves on labels and what they purchase at supermarkets. However, with demand in this sector increasing, it is nice to see large retailers offering healthy alternatives and striving to increase their selection. "

0," Instead of opting for potentially harmful mainstream acne medications, try safe and effective natural remedies for acne problems. You may find your acne and associated problems such as redness and light scarring completely gone or greatly improved in as little as two weeks or less. Natural Acne Remedies Lemon juice, tea-tree oil and aqueous cream Before going to bed, bathe or shower and shampoo. Next, apply lemon juice over your face (this will itch for a minute or two). Rub in a small amount of pure tea-tree oil. Then, apply a thick layer of aqueous cream to your face and leave on overnight, lying on your back if you must. Or, after about half an hour or so, rub the cream in. Help this and other remedies along by eating three kiwifruit and about 3/4 cup of raw carrots daily. Oatmeal, vinegar, raspberries, egg, sea salt Pour some oatmeal into a small bowl. Mash up some raspberries and mix them with about a teaspoon of sea salt and the oatmeal. Add about two tablespoons of vinegar and one egg and mix with a spoon until it makes a pasty mix. Wash your face with an exfoliating scrub (such as apricot scrub) or exfoliate with a loofah. Steam your face and then apply the mixture thickly. Leave on for about 30 minutes or until the mixture is somewhat dry and starts to crumble off. Rinse with cold water. Honey and cinnamon Take three tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of cinnamon and make a paste. Put it on the affected area and apply it in circles. Leave it on while you sleep and wash it off in the morning Lemon juice, H2O2, willow bark, aloe, echinacea and goldenseal Mix in a bowl or container some lemon juice, a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, willow bark powder, echinacea and goldenseal. Mix together and use this solution as an astringent. Apply w/ cotton balls or tissue and leave it on your face to dry. Once it dries, put aloe vera on your skin. Do this twice daily after first washing your face. Fresh basil leaves Take a small handful of fresh basil leaves (available at most grocery stores). Let the leaves simmer in two cups of water for about 15 minutes and then put the mixture in the refrigerator to chill. Apply the mixture to troubled areas or your entire face with a cotton ball. Gets rid of acne and also helps with any existing scarring. Egg white Dab a little egg white on pimples and leave it on overnight or sometimes apply it all over your face or affected area. You'll likely notice results the next morning. Pimples/zits are reduced or gone, and your skin feels great. Apple cider vinegar Soak a cotton ball in cider vinegar and add salt to the cotton ball. Apply to infected area and hold there for as long as you can. This should instantly reduce the swelling. Works well for large cystic acne as well. Other natural acne remedies include: "
0," Had the results of a 1994 drug trial similar to the recent TGN1412 trial in London -- which left six volunteers hospitalized with life-threatening side effects -- been required to be released to the public, the disastrous TGN1412 trial could have been prevented. Terry Hamblin, a retired professor of medicine from Southampton, says that he conducted a trial using an antibody similar to the one in TGN1412 -- which caused rapid, serious side effects in six previously healthy volunteers in March. Hamblin's trial was unsuccessful, and the trial information -- along with details on side effects such as rigors, hypotension and fever -- was never published because Hamblin did not believe medical journals would be interested. Hamblin also says he was not required to inform regulators of the side effects in his study. However, many believe that if his trial had been made public, the design of the TGN1412 trial may have been altered to be less dangerous for volunteers. Hamblin's trial, for example, administered the experimental drug slowly, over a period of several hours, to allow him to properly identify and stop negative side effects. TeGenero -- the company that makes TGN1412 -- has come under fire for its trial design, which some critics say did not follow the standard research practice of administering experimental drugs slowly and in very low doses. Hamblin's trial information was presented in June 2006 to a UK commission seeking to make information on phase-one human drug trials public. Professor Gordon Duff, the commission's chair, has made several recommendations to the pharmaceutical industry to help remedy the TGN1412 disaster. The industry has accepted many of Duff's recommendations, including agreeing to publish the trial results of drugs that are successfully licensed or about which the drug company's own employees have safety concerns. But the industry has rejected Duff's call to publicly disclose all phase-one trial results like Hamblin's - seemingly the one step that would have prevented this latest tragedy. 'Pharmaceutical drug trials remain steeped in secrecy,' said Mike Adams, a prominent critic of current drug industry practices. 'It is very clear that drug companies value intellectual property more than human lives.' ### "
0," Sleep is vital to one's health and well being. It has been implicated that loss of sleep can directly affect the immune system and increase the risk of various cancers. The immune and hormonal systems communication seems to be a key factor in preventing cancer cells from dividing beyond the immune system's ability to keep them in check. Melatonin and cortisol are two of the most important hormones in preventing cancer. When these hormones are balanced, the risk of cancer and the rate of its progression can be reduced. It has been estimated that up to 88 percent of cancer patients are affected by sleep disorders. Sleep apnea is more common in those with cancer than the general public and cancer patients are twice as likely to experience insomnia. A patient's immune system can be impaired by restless nights from sleep disorders. According to researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , sleep apnea has been shown to have a strong correlation with death from cancer. Researchers found that almost 30 percent of patients reporting cancer-related fatigue were diagnosed with sleep apnea and 60 percent were diagnosed with insomnia. Researchers at Stanford and the University of Louisville School of Medicine showed that a patient's circadian rhythm may influence cancer progression. The circadian rhythm is the night and day cycle affecting metabolism, physiology and hormonal production. Melatonin and cortisol Melatonin increases during sleep and has anti-oxidant properties. With an altered circadian rhythm, the body produces less melatonin and the cell's DNA may be more susceptible to cancer-causing mutations. Melatonin has another key role in slowing the ovaries' production of estrogen. For those with breast and ovarian tumors, estrogen stimulates the cancerous cells to continue dividing. Another influential hormone is cortisol, which is high in the morning and declines throughout the day. Cortisol has a regulating factor on immune system activity, including natural-killer cells which destroy cancer cells. The Stanford study found that people who are at high risk for breast cancer have an altered cortisol rhythm, meaning those with a shifted cortisol cycle may be more cancer susceptible. It was also found that women with breast cancer who had their cortisol cycle disrupted, with peak levels in the afternoon rather than at dawn, died earlier from the disease and slept more poorly. Melatonin has also been shown to reduce the growth of prostate cancer. According to a study in the journal Cancer, Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention , results showed that men who had trouble sleeping were twice as likely to develop prostate cancer compared to those who slept well. The correlation was even stronger for cases of advanced prostate cancer and the risk increased relative to the severity of the sleep problems. The study implied that sleep may become a potential target for intervention to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Approximately 15-20 percent of employees in the USA work an overnight shift. This timing of work can lead to circadian disruption including melatonin synthesis. Studies have shown a potential link between exposure to light at night and risk of breast cancer. Having proper melatonin and cortisol levels has a major impact on sleep. When these hormones are in the normal range they can help improve quality and quantity of sleep. These levels should be tested to screen for potential hormone and immune imbalances so they can be corrected before cancer has a chance to get a foothold. This should be a foundation of any alternative cancer treatment protocol. "
0," UPDATE: All the petitions from San Diego County were in fact turned and accounted for. Text has been added to clarify that the actual number of signatures can not currently be verified. A major grassroots effort to overturn California's recently passed SB277 forced vaccination bill came to an end yesterday as volunteers reached the Monday deadline to submit signatures they have worked tirelessly to collect over a three-month period . To immediately halt the mandatory vaccine bill and qualify it for the November 2016 ballot, volunteers needed to gather 366,000 signatures. As the September 28 deadline neared, @SB277Referendum leaders appeared excited and optimistic about reaching their goal, with the initiative's leader Libertarian Tim Donnelly posting photos of boxes stacked high and loaded with signed petitions. On September 16, referendum leaders estimated that they had received at least 300,000 signatures, and two weeks later there was buzz that they had reached close to half a million signatures. Leaders also announced that they received an extremely generous donation of $150,000 from an in-state donor, bringing their total funds raised to over $300,000 a remarkable undertaking for a grassroots effort that was given so little time to prepare. SB277 Referendum volunteers suspect sabotage from within as panic ensues Despite the positive social media posts leading up to the deadline, things started to go awry once volunteers began submitting their signatures, with petitioners citing huge discrepancies in various counties and some claiming that they only received credit for a third of what was turned in to referendum managers Donnelly and Lauren Stephens, who were responsible for submitting the petitions to validation companies. While the total number of signatures has not yet been confirmed, what is clear is that the number of signatures validated thus far is much lower than previously estimated. Below are some estimates of the discrepancies: San Diego County submitted eight boxes of signatures but only received one in return Orange County is missing 6,000 signatures San Bernardino County is missing 8,000 Sacramento County is missing 15,000 20,000 signatures While signature totals are still unknown, only an estimated 100,000 of the potential half a million signatures have been accounted for meaning somehow, hundreds of thousands of signatures are missing. The missing signatures have led some volunteers to claim that the referendum was sabotaged, and likely from within, prompting organizers to file a request for an investigation to the California Secretary of State. The large discrepancies in signature counts is generating panic among volunteers, causing some to point fingers at referendum leaders, with some volunteers alleging that they dropped off many more signatures with Stephens than she turned in to the validation companies. Stephens reportedly claims that she did not discard any petitions, but she has failed to explain where the signatures have gone, an odd occurrence considering that two weeks prior she publicly announced they were expecting at least 300K signatures meaning one would imagine she would have noticed that the number of signatures being turned in was far lower than her estimates. Despite repeated calls to Donnelly and Stephens, they have not returned our request for comment. While both Donnelly and Stephens have remained eerily silent during the chaos that's recently ensued, although vague, Donnelly finally issued a statement yesterday on the referendum's Facebook page (view the entire post here ): Never before in my political experience have I witnessed such extensive and determined opposition to a campaign. This opposition was from very powerful special interests, namely the pharmaceutical lobby and a [ sic ] big pharmaceutical companies. The lengths to which these forces would go knew no bounds. The SB277 Referendum was sabotaged from without and within by powerful forces from its very inception, but we never gave up and we never gave in. ... Whatever the outcome is of the signatures that dozens of dedicated leaders are turning in today at county Registrar of Voter Offices across the state of California, I am proud to have served in this great cause with such great Americans. Despite the possible sabotage of the SB277 Referendum, the effort to reclaim your right to medical choice is by no means over.

0," The progressive elitist class loves to claim moral superiority when it comes to the development of public policy, so it is no small thing that the pinnacle of elitism - Harvard University - has proven what good, ol' American common sense has conveyed for decades. Namely, that gun control does not work to appreciably reduce violent criminal activity. Oh, and no, the mainstream media didn't report on this finding far and wide. In fact, the results of this Harvard study have been largely ignored. The study, called 'Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?' examined figures from 'intentional deaths' throughout continental Europe. Researchers then juxtaposed those figures with the United States 'to show that more gun control does not necessarily lead to lower death rates or violent crime,' Breitbart News ' AWR Hawkins wrote. Where guns are more plentiful, violence is less common He added: Because the findings so clearly demonstrate that more gun laws may in fact increase death rates, the study says that 'the mantra that more guns mean more deaths and that fewer guns, therefore, mean fewer deaths' is wrong. For instance, researchers note that numbers for Eastern European gun ownership and corresponding murder rates readily do not show that fewer guns mean less death. In Russia, for one, where the rate of gun ownership is about, 4,000 per 100,000 residents, the murder rate was 20.52 per 100,000 in 2002. In Finland during the same year, where gun ownership rates are much higher (39,000 per 100,000), the murder rate was practically nil, at just 1.98 per 100,000. In examining Western Europe, researchers found that Norway 'has far and away Western Europe's highest household gun ownership rate (32%), but also its lowest murder rate.' When the Harvard researchers focused on intentional deaths by comparing the U.S. and continental Europe, findings were no less substantial and telling. The U.S. is often called the most violent nation in the world by gun control advocates, but it actually comes in 7th - behind Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus and the Ukraine - in murders. In terms of suicides, America only ranks 22nd. Hawkins notes, citing the study, 'The murder rate in Russia, where handguns are banned, is 30.6; the rate in the U.S. is 7.8.' More guns = less crime and we've known this More from Hawkins: The authors of the study conclude that the burden of proof rests on those who claim more guns equal more death and violent crime; such proponents should 'at the very least [be able] to show a large number of nations with more guns have more death and that nations that impose stringent gun controls have achieved substantial reductions in criminal violence (or suicide).' But after intense study the authors conclude 'those correlations are not observed when a large number of nations are compared around the world.' The researchers also found: Indeed, 'data on firearms ownership by constabulary area in England,' like data from the United States, show 'a negative correlation,' that is, 'where firearms are most dense violent crime rates are lowest, and where guns are least dense violent crime rates are highest.' No question about it: The Harvard study merely reinforces what many of us 'common folk' have known for years - that fewer guns means more crime, more death, more mayhem. And why wouldn't it be that way? A firearm is the ultimate equalizer; small, frail women or weaker men who tend to be targets of violence are more than a match for bigger, badder people when they are armed . Our own crime statistics bear this out. According to the FBI, since 1992 there has been a 50-percent reduction in the violent crime and murder rate in the United States. What's even more notable, say experts, is that the crime rate has continued to fall despite the Great Recession of the past few years. 'This is actually a pretty significant drop, which is fascinating because we'd normally expect crime to go up when we're in an economic downturn,' said Gary LaFree, a criminology professor at the University of Maryland, in an interview with NBC News in January.

0," Eating just a few ounces of broccoli each day may significantly reduce a person's risk of ulcers and stomach cancer, researchers from Johns Hopkins University have found. In a study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research , scientists assigned 50 people in Japan to eat either 2.5 ounces of broccoli sprouts or 2.5 ounces of alfalfa sprouts each day for two months. Broccoli, a cruciferous vegetable, contains high levels of the protective phytochemical sulforaphane. Alfalfa is not a cruciferous vegetable and contains no sulforaphane. At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers analyzed participant stool samples for a chemical called HpSA, known to be a reliable marker of infection with the Heliobacter pylori bacterium. H. pylori causes chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, significantly increasing the risk of stomach cancer and duodenal or stomach ulcers. While 25 to 30 percent of people in the United States carry the bacteria in their stomachs, 80 percent show no symptoms of the infection. Infection rates are much higher in Japan, at nearly 90 percent, due in part to crowding. The researchers found that among those who ate broccoli sprouts, HpSA levels decreased 40 percent by the end of the experiment. Participants were then told to stop eating broccoli sprouts. After another two months, HpSA levels had returned to pre-study levels. Consumption of alfalfa sprouts had no effect on HpSA levels. 'H. pylori is a known carcinogen,' Fahey said. 'The fact that we were able to reduce the effects of an infectious agent that is also a carcinogen gives us hope that if someone were to eat broccoli sprouts or broccoli regularly, it would reduce levels of H. pylori and, over a period of many years, reduce the chance that they would get that cancer. It is not proven, but the results are highly suggestive.' The researchers also found that inflammation levels in the stomach were reduced by consumption of broccoli sprouts. 'The fact that the levels of infection and inflammation were reduced suggests the likelihood of getting gastritis and ulcers and cancer is probably reduced,' Fahey said. 'The evidence is all pointing toward broccoli or broccoli sprouts being able to prevent cancer in humans.' The researchers believe that much of broccoli's protective benefit comes from its high levels of sulforaphane. In addition to functioning as an antibiotic, this chemical stimulates the body to reduce a number of enzymes with different health benefits. Prior research has shown that some of these enzymes protect the skin from sun damage, while others act to reduce inflammation or prevent heart disease. In a second experiment, the same team of researchers fed H. pylori-infected mice either plain water or broccoli-sprout smoothies for eight weeks. They then examined the animals' stomachs for levels of H. pylori. Infection levels had not changed in mice drinking water, but were significantly reduced in the broccoli group. When the researchers genetically engineered another group of mice for inability to activate certain protective enzymes, however, a diet of broccoli-sprout smoothies had no effect on H. pylori infection. According to Steven H. Zeisel of the University of North Carolina, who was not involved in the study, sulforaphane also stimulates the body to produce liver enzymes that help deactivate carcinogens. 'People who eat more broccoli tune up their liver and other cells to destroy cancer-causing agents,' he said. Although cooking has been shown to reduce sulforaphane levels by 90 percent, Zeisel said that even two to three ounces of cooked broccoli per day would provide a benefit. Other vegetables also stimulate the body's anti-cancer mechanisms, he added, recommending an increase in 'the amount of plants in the diet.' He warned that supplements alone can not provide the same benefit as a diet high in vegetables. 'It's probably a combination of ingredients in the plant that is responsible,' he said. 'When you try to extract them out to make a pill, it usually doesn't work.' Sources for this story include: news.bbc.co.uk; www.app.com . "
0," A 33-year-old father from the U.K. is completely cancer-free, but not because of chemotherapy or radiation. David Hibbitt's doctors diagnosed him with a 'terminal' case of bowel cancer that they said would kill him within 18 months, but he successfully eliminated this cancer on his own by taking therapeutic doses of cannabis oil at a cost of about $75 per month. Initially opting for chemotherapy, radiation and surgery -- and watching this all fail -- Hibbitt decided to take control of his own health by researching his condition online. When he came upon information outlining cannabis oil as a viable treatment alternative, he decided to give it a go with amazing results. According to the Daily Mail Online , Hibbitt went the cannabis route as a last-ditch effort when all else failed, and it turned out to be the best decision he could have made. As of January, medical scans show that Hibbitt is completely cancer-free, all thanks to the concentrated cannabis oil that he took from small vials provided by a local dealer. 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first,' Hibbitt explains. 'I've never been into drugs. But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. I felt like chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' 'Phoenix Tears' grade cannabis oil saved David Hibbitt's life by curing his cancer Understandably hesitant due to the stigma that still surrounds this powerful healing plant, including its unjustified illegality in many areas, Hibbitt thought long and hard about his options before concluding that cannabis was worth a go, especially in light of the health damage he'd already undergone as a result of invasive chemotherapy. He contacted a local manufacturer of high-potency cannabis oil, a therapeutic grade of which is commonly referred to as 'Phoenix Tears,' and was able to procure the amount he would need for treatment. The result, he says, is evident in his now-clean bill of health. 'It gets you pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy,' he told the media. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Establishment threatened by natural cancer medicines like cannabis oil that cost a fraction of what conventional treatments run One would think that Hibbitt's amazing recovery from advanced-stage bowel cancer using natural cannabis oil would be the subject of international headlines, with health officials everywhere scrambling to end prohibition in order to allow people to grow and use their own healing medicines for minimal cost compared to chemotherapy and radiation. But this is far from what's actually happening. Like with most other natural cancer treatments, nearly all of which are outlawed in the U.S., cannabis oil is still regarded as 'unproven' or even 'dangerous' by the establishment, which would rather that cancer patients undergo poisoning than consume a healing plant with literally dozens of healing compounds found nowhere else in nature. 'We know that cannabinoids -- the active chemicals found in cannabis -- can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumors,' admits Dr. Kat Arney from Cancer Research U.K., at the same time citing the excuse that there 'isn't good evidence from clinical trials' to prove that these compounds actually help cancer patients. But the proof is in the patients who've successfully used the medicine and experienced miraculous healing from it.

0," The multi-million dollar infertility industry offers a huge list of expensive -- and often invasive -- tests and procedures to help couples who have difficulty conceiving, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Unfortunately, assisted reproduction technologies (ART) can have a dark side that'srarely mentioned by the mainstream media. High tech baby making procedures are increasingly being linked to an increased risk of congenital malformations as well a greater chance for several diseases down the road ( http://www.selfnews.com/029116_infertilit... ). But now a new systematic review of research by New Zealand scientists just published in The Cochrane Library provides evidence a natural therapy could be a solution to fertility problems in many men. The study found that men who take antioxidant supplements are significantly more likely to get their partners pregnant (the regular old-fashioned non-ART way) than men who don't take the supplements. Less-than-optimal fertility, known as subfertility, affects about one in 20 men. In the new research paper, investigators in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand pointed out that chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are cause damage to cells, especially sperm cells. This may explain why some men have lowered sperm counts which can interfere with their ability to fertilize eggs. But a host of antioxidants , including certain vitamins and minerals, are known to reduce the damage created by ROS. The review zeroed in on 34 trials totaling 2,876 couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, including in vitro fertilization and sperm injections. Most men in these studies had been found to have low sperm counts or low sperm motility. The research trials examined all involved treating the men with many different types of oral antioxidants, including vitamin E, L-carnitine, zinc and magnesium. The results showed that, compared to controls, a woman was far more likely to become pregnant if her partner took antioxidants. Other trials examined the effects of antioxidants on sperm concentration and motility and also found mostly positive improvements with antioxidant supplementation. 'When trying to conceive as part of an assisted reproductive program, it may be advisable to encourage men to take oral antioxidant supplements to improve their partners' chances of becoming pregnant,' said lead researcher Marian Showell, in a media statement. She added that the research team didn't have enough data comparing different antioxidants to reach any conclusions about which supplements may be the most effective in helping men achieve fatherhood. 'We need more head-to-comparisons to understand whether any one antioxidant is performing better than any other,' Dr. Showell said. For more information: http://www.selfnews.com/antioxidants.html "
0," The journal Food and Chemical Toxicology (FCT) removed the Gilles Eric-Seralini team's research paper recently. This happened after two major events. First there was a groundswell of 'scientific criticisms' from scientists with or formerly with GMO industry connections. Some even with GMO patents. Their conflicts of interest were never an issue. The mainstream media (MSM) accepted those criticisms as scientific truth without question or consulting Seralini and his many supporters. Seralini and the researchers at University of Caen in France don't represent any of the industry mega-corporations that frequently advertise through the MSM. Nor do hundreds of scientists who support the study. Soon after this tsunami of outrage from GMO related scientists that got favorable press, along came former Monsanto scientist Richard E. Goodman to the newly created post of associate editor for biotechnology at FCT. Then suddenly the editor-in-chief of FCT, A. Wallace Hayes, announced the removal of Seralini's study 'Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize'. Hayes admitted the study was not fraudulent or inaccurate, but explained that it was inconclusive. Real scientists jumped on that one, explaining that peer reviewed published studies are often inconclusive, recommending 'further studies'. Another study harmful to Monsanto was thrown out just after Goodman's arrival. That was a Brazilian study proving Monsanto's Bt corn insecticide starter genes do not disintegrate in mammalian stomachs but survive intact to harm mammals' blood cells. That study has now been published in another journal. (Source below) Refuting GMO mad scientists' critical howls reported by the MSM Wrong rats used: They were the same rats Monsanto had used in a 90 day trial. The Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain has a life expectancy of 24 to 36 months. Just right for a two year study that's intended to replicate the life span of a human. SD rats tend to have spontaneous tumors: True, around 30 percent of SD rats get cancer symptoms without test-induced provocations. Again, this mimics human statistics on cancer. More SD rats fed well under maximum regulatory amounts of Roundup along with the Roundup Ready corn developed tumors than the control rats within four to seven months of the study. The exposed rats also died earlier. Too few rats: The short Monsanto study used 20 rats for each group. But, they only checked urine and serum samples of 10 in each group. The Seralini study used 10 for each grouping, but they tested urine and serum samples from all 10. Insufficient study for proving carcinogenicity: The title of the study tells us that was not Seralin's intent, it was a long term toxicity study of Roundup and Roundup Ready corn, period. Tumors were incidental. The rats who were exposed showed signs of liver, kidney, and other organ damage. Prelude to the rat study Regulatory agencies only test the active ingredients of pesticides and herbicides such as Monsanto's Roundup while acquiescing to industry demands of 'protecting trade secrets' for the 'inactive' ingredients used as adjuvants to increase glyphosate's plant absorption. An earlier study from Caen University by Mesnage, Bernay and Seralini separated the ingredients of glyphosate based herbicides, including Monsanto's Roundup, to determine what 'inert' substances added to the toxicity of glyphosate. That study determined the most commonly used adjuvant, POE-15, was more toxic by itself than glyphosate. It asserted that regulatory testing only active ingredients is useless, and the combination of all the ingredients need to be tested long term on mammals to determine human safety.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The great mystery of bee deaths has been solved. Colony Collapse Disorder is poisoning with a known insect neurotoxin. Clothianidin, a pesticide manufactured by Bayer, has been clearly linked to die offs in Germany and France. Although the bee die offs that have occurred recently are more severe, there have been many in the past from the same and similar products. In North Dakota, a lawsuit is pending against Bayer for the loss of their bees in 1995, the result of spraying rapeseed with Imidacloprid. In 1999, the same product was banned in France for use as a seed dressing for sunflowers when they lost one-third of their hives after widespread spraying. In 2004, it was banned for use on corn. Recently, France refused to approve Bayer's request to sell Clothianidin. Clothianidin and Imidacloprid are both members of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids. They are well known as insect neurotoxins, especially with regard to bees. The spokesperson for the Coalition Against Bayer Dangers, based in Germany, stated, 'We have been pointing out the risks of neonicotinoids for almost 10 years now. This proves without a doubt that the chemicals can come into contact with bees and kill them. These pesticides shouldn't be on the market.' Not a Surprise That neonicotinoids are potent neurotoxins, especially in insects, is unsurprising. They were developed for precisely that purpose. Bayer says that their use is safe for bees, when used according to instructions. This involves using a glue that keeps the pesticides stuck to the seeds on which they're used. There are many problems with this. Agribusiness corporations are known to evade anything that costs them money. The glue costs money. The equipment and personnel required to apply it costs money. More careful pesticide application to try to keep it from becoming airborne costs money. Obviously, both unscrupulous agribusiness farmers and unknowing small farmers -- not to mention home gardeners -- will, at least occasionally, not use the glue. Even then, it's impossible to believe that a fair amount of these pesticides won't become airborne. Further, their residue will poison the soil. It will be passed on into foods, which means that insects will come into contact with it there. Pharmaceutical Connection Isn't it interesting that a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, Bayer, also makes a product that is a poison by design? Bayer is not an exception. Many, if not most, do business in both arenas. That alone should give pause for thought. Here's a list of corporations -- not expected to be complete -- that profit in both pharmaceuticals and pesticides: "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Free radical damage is one of the leading causes for accelerated aging and cancer cell formation. When cells are exposed to heavy amounts of free radicals without sufficient cell signaling processes, they develop genetic mutations that replicate abnormally. Anti-oxidants are nature's defense against free-radicals. Some of nature's most powerful anti-oxidants are a class of polyphenols called anthocyanins. Many plants are exposed to direct sunlight and ultra violet rays all day long. This constant biological challenge has forced these plants to form powerful free radical scavenging anti-oxidant polyphenols in order to protect themselves. The anthocyanin class of polyphenols is an especially strong protective component. Anthocyanin molecules take their name from their deep blue or purple color. Cyan is the Greek word for dark blue. This color is derived at the cellular level through very unique double bond structures. These unique components have allowed their host plants to thrive in an environment of direct sunlight; they act as a natural sunscreen through absorbing blue-green and UV light. This process of photo inhibition dramatically reduces stress on the plant. Additionally, these components act as anti-oxidants with very quick and effective free radical scavenging effects. Scientists have found over 600 forms of anthocyanins naturally occurring in our ecosystem. The most common form of anthocyanin is cyaniding-3-glucoside (C3G), which has been shown through human and animal studies to directly influence gene expression. C3G has been shown to selectively up-regulate genes that provide more protection while down-regulating genes that cause damage such as pro-inflammatory mediators. Most people in our society are chronically inflamed due to excessive free radical formation, lowered anti-oxidant status, nutritional deficiencies, poor fatty acid balance, elevated toxins, elevated mental & emotional stress, and elevated physical & neurological stress. When these factors are present, the body produces higher levels of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines that produce inflammation and tissue damage. Under inflammatory conditions certain cells will trigger oncogenes, which are genes that induce cancer-cell reproduction. The greater the acceleration rate of oncogene formation is the faster the rate of cancer growth. Once a cancer cell gets formed it has a strong potential to spread into local tissue and metastasize into other areas. The body's own natural defense against cancer is programmed cell death called apoptosis. Anthocyanins have been found to suppress the inflammatory conditions that create oncogenes while promoting cancer cell apoptosis. Cancer cells are typically in what is called an 'undifferentiated' state when they are formed. This means they do not have any specific functional characteristics like a normal liver or skin cell. C3G has been shown in studies to induce normal differentiation of certain cancers such as melanoma cells. This is very important because cancer cells that differentiate are dramatically less dangerous than undifferentiated cells. Incorporating More Anthocyanins in Your Diet: 1.Make a shake every day with coconut milk and anthocyanin rich berries such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, acai berries, elderberries, &/or bilberries. 2.Snack on red cabbage, make red-cabbage sauerkraut, or juice red cabbage. 3.Use exotic foods such as purple cauliflower, purple corn, & purple broccoli. 4.Take a supplement with berry extracts in it.

0," I've been in discussions with Matt Monarch, the owner of The Raw Food World and the primary distributor of Adya Clarity, about their response to the questions that have been raised. This is the product covered in my article yesterday which raised questions about several issues, including it being marketed for internal use, labeling problems, health claims and so on ( http://www.selfnews.com/034005_Adya_Clari... ). After reviewing all the available information about Adya Clarity, Matt Monarch has really made a positive decision to commit to three important changes in the labeling and marketing of Adya Clarity as conditions of his continued marketing of the product. Matt informed me that the president of Adya, Inc., Matt Bakos, also agrees to these conditions: 1) Adya Clarity will not be marketed or labeled for internal use unless and until there is clinical evidence available to support the safe internal use of the product. This means Adya would need to be subjected to clinical studies at a reputable organization that can monitor the intake of the product in a group of people and then assess their levels of iron and aluminum to ensure no overload or toxicity results (among other observed outcomes). While such in-depth testing would not normally be expected for a food item with a long history of traditional use as a food, for a non-food item such as Adya Clarity, this type of testing is wise to pursue. Also: Although this was not one of the agreed conditions, I personally suggest that the product label include the phrase, 'Not for internal use' unless it is proven safe for internal use. 2) Adya Clarity will be relabeled with a 'full transparency' label that discloses the accurate concentration of elements in the product in a way that is clear to customers and does not minimize or hide any particular element as is currently being done. In addition, the 'ingredients' section of the label will accurately list the key ingredient sulfuric acid which is currently not listed on the label, as well as aluminum sulfate in its proper concentration. 3) Adya Clarity's label will conform to the full approval of Ralph Fucetola , the 'Vitamin Lawyer,' who specializes in FDA-compliant product labeling ( www.VitaminLawyer.com ). In other words, The Raw Food World will not sell Adya Clarity unless and until the label is approved by Ralph Fucetola. This is a big deal because Fucetola will not allow his name to be associated with any product label unless it strictly conforms to FDA labeling requirements. In addition to this, any refund requests by customers who purchased Adya Clarity are being honored. The labeling changes are to be completed within roughly 30 days, says Matt, who has already begun the process of working with Adya, Inc. to get these changes completed. selfnews will be kept informed of labeling approval by Ralph Fucetola, assuming he is willing to take on the project (let's hope he does!). Why I still question the safety of Adya Clarity For the record, I have good reason to believe that Adya Clarity may not be a safe product. That it has been promoted for internal use is extremely concerning to me. Obviously, selfnews will not sell Adya Clarity , not now and not in the future. There is no clinical evidence to support Adya's safety when used internally. What we are seeing now, even in light of all the questions that have been raised about Adya, is some people defending the product's internal use . Adya is a product with a high iron content (2,000 PPM) dissolved in sulfuric acid. According to a data sheet provided by the manufacturer, the raw materials used to make Adya contain 50 grams per liter of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), also called 'oil of vitriol.' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid ) And yet, surprisingly, I see testimonials of people who say they are still drinking it in alarmingly high quantities, such as this one: '[Name removed] I have been taking four supershots daily for more then 21 days fasting on Adya and coconut water and papaya. I feel its truly potent. I have some challenges with my left ear. Black stuff is coming out of it. I feel its the heavy metals being neutralized coming out the fastest way leaving my brain. I will continue using it.' I have seen other testimonials from people who also insist in internally consuming this product, even as they are describing what they call 'detox symptoms' which may in fact have an entirely different explanation. I do not control the marketing of this product, and I'm not the FDA. What I can do is raise legitimate questions, work with the distributor to improve the product labeling, and then give people like you the information you need to decide for yourself what you wish to consume. Some people make decisions with a level of clarity and common sense, and others simply don't. You won't see me drinking Adya Clarity, nor selling it. And I would hope that enough common sense exists across the industry that no one else would drink it, either, unless it is somehow proven to be safe for consumption. "
0," Tweet Thirty-one years ago, a man wrote a book exposing the politics involved in cancer therapy. It painted a picture of a world in which an effective control for cancer existed but was outlawed because it couldn't line the pockets of the powerful pharmaceutical industry. In 31 years, little has changed. G. Edward Griffin's 1974 book World Without Cancer is as poignant today as the day it was written, and in some circles, just as controversial. That's because Griffin tells the story of a powerful substance that, despite its potential to aid in the fight against cancer, few cancer sufferers will ever know about, and that their doctors certainly will not offer them. That substance is vitamin B-17, also called Laetrile, and it is a naturally-occurring substance that has been banned for use in the control of cancer in the United States. Griffin was first introduced to the subject of vitamin therapy for cancer control while on a fishing trip with San Francisco physician John Richardson, he said in a telephone interview. Dr. Richardson told Griffin he had seen great success in treating his cancer patients with vitamin B-17, but he faced opposition from local medical authorities who, when they caught wind of what he was doing, balked at the fact he was using a treatment that was not FDA-approved. In an effort to protect his right to administer a therapy he had seen work on so many patients, Dr. Richardson turned to Griffin for help in advancing his cause, and thus was the beginning of World Without Cancer. Griffin, who knew nothing of the science of cancer when he began his project, soon learned plenty. His research led him to the conclusion that naturally-occurring Laetrile is indeed an effective treatment for cancer. In fact, from the time he started his research to today, Griffin says he has seen literally thousands of people benefit from treatment with Laetrile. He also learned that cancer is a disease linked directly to a deficiency of vitamin B-17, which is found in high amounts in apricot kernels. However, perhaps the most important and most troubling thing he learned was that Laetrile and its health potential were being kept out of doctors' hands for political not scientific reasons. According to Griffin, the 1953 California Report continues to be the basis of most scientific or legal opposition to vitamin B-17 today. The report, written by Dr. Henry Garland and Dr. E. M. McDonald of the California Medical Association's Cancer Advisory Commission, claims there is no proof Laetrile is an effective control for cancer. (It should be noted that these two particular doctors were at the time also insisting there was no link between smoking and lung cancer.) However, Griffin writes in World Without Cancer that Garland and McDonald actually falsified information from Laetrile experiments cited in the California Report. In fact, 10 years after the report was published, original documents surfaced that proved information had been falsified. Although the report was subsequently updated, additional problems such as insufficient vitamin dosages used in the experiments persisted, and the conclusions of the original California Report remained embedded in the literature and minds of many. Additional studies conducted by well-known groups like the Sloane-Kettering Institute have proven the effectiveness of Laetrile, according to Griffin. However, those study results have not been publicized. 'When you dig into the facts, and you read the reports by the people themselves inside those institutions, you find out they found in their testing that Laetrile was highly effective, but they received directives from the top to suppress that information,' Griffin said. So why would the 'powers-that-be' work so hard to suppress information that could benefit thousands of people dying of cancer? 'They do that because they're trying to make a buck, and something that is found in nature, like Laetrile, cannot be patented,' says Griffin. But the story doesn't stop there. The Hitler / Pharma connection World Without Cancer is divided into two parts, and in the second half of the book, Griffin goes on to reveal some disturbing information about an international drug cartel that came into being in the years before World War II that he says played a significant role in shaping the field of medicine in this country. This powerful cartel was created, Griffin argues, when I.G. Farben, a German-based chemical company and financial backer of Adolf Hitler, joined together with Standard Oil of New Jersey, founded by American business tycoon John D. Rockefeller, in an agreement not to compete. The partnership was largely concealed, since neither company wanted their countries to know about the relationship in the event of an inevitable second world war. In a lecture, Griffin once referred to the Farben-Rockefeller merger as 'the largest and most powerful cartel the world has ever known, even though most people have never heard about it.' And so the extremely influential Rockefeller came to be interlocked with the drug industry, and under the guise of philanthropy, began donating large sums of money to America's faltering medical schools. Of course, the catch was that such schools were told the money had to be used for drug research, which would create a great profit for Rockefeller interests. In their time of need, medical schools readily complied. 'When they accepted the money, they had to follow the dollar, and they designed their curricula so it favors pharmacy (and) pharmaceutical drugs,' says Griffin. This effectively gave birth to the conventional medical care system we know today, which is based almost entirely on prescription drugs and knows little to nothing about basic nutrition. 'The medical schools of the United States now teach the students everything there is to know about their product, which is drugs,' Griffin says, 'And so [doctors] come out as highly trained drug salesmen, and they don't even know it!' Even doctors are kept in the dark about B-17 It's no wonder then that natural treatments like vitamin B-17 remain banned or widely unknown in the United States; there is a long line of profit and power ensuring they stay that way. That's why doctors will not offer cancer patients vitamin therapy with vitamin B-17, and why most doctors, if asked about Laetrile, will say it has been proven ineffective. However, Griffin doesn't blame the doctors for conventional modern medicine's focus on drugs, noting, 'They're kind of victims of this whole system as much as the rest of us, and they and their families die of cancer just like everyone else. So it's clear that they're not holding back a control for cancer that they know works. If they knew about it, they would use it, just like Dr. Richardson. It's just that they're pretty well sheltered from that information, and they rely very strongly on the prestigious sources at the top.' Since Griffin's book hit shelves in 1974, awareness of natural health has increased, but little has changed in terms of the availability of Laetrile in the United States. It remains illegal for doctors to prescribe or sell Laetrile as a control for cancer. According to Griffin, however, some clinics continue to quietly use the substance, often only after the patient has obtained it. Many other patients travel to Mexico for treatment. Griffin worries that vitamin B-17 is not the only natural treatment for serious disease being suppressed because of political and financial reasons. 'I'm convinced, and this is just my opinion now; I can't back this up with facts, but on the basis of what I've seen, I think this whole AIDS field is just a rubber stamp of the cancer field,' Griffin states. He adds, 'I am sure that you'll find this thing all over the medical field because they follow the buck. They have to have something that's patented to do that, and patented medicines are usually toxic.' Today, Griffin says writing World Without Cancer dramatically changed his views and may have saved his life. 'It is like night into day,' he says. 'I am firmly convinced that had I not done this research and learned what I did, I probably would have been dead today because I was living the lifestyle of the typical American fast foods, no exercise (and) no awareness of the fact that I had any responsibility for my health.' The politics of cancer therapy On the first page of his book, Griffin openly acknowledges that what he writes is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, American Medical Association or the American Cancer Society and says that they in fact would call it 'fraud and quackery.' That is because, as Griffin has often said, the politics of cancer therapy are far more complicated than the science of cancer therapy. This core problem, according to Griffin, cannot be solved until we get the politics out of a lot of other areas as well. In the meantime, it is up to each individual consumer to take responsibility for his or her own health and wellbeing. 'I think it's important for people to understand that government, in most cases, is not the solution; it's the problem,' Griffin warns. 'As long as people think that the government is supposed to take care of them and protect them and that they can trust their politicians as long as they think that, they're in deep trouble. And, in fact, we are all in deep trouble because of that kind of thinking.' A second, updated edition of World Without Cancer was released in 1997 and can be purchased at Griffin's website, http://www.realityzone.com.

0," By now, everyone is aware that the IRS has been caught red-handed conducting politically-motivated audits of conservative non-profit groups. Non-profits that taught the Constitution or even mildly criticized the federal government were targeted for special scrutiny, and the IRS demanded they turn over names of all their donors and volunteers . 'The IRS came under fire on Friday when its Office of Inspector General released a draft of an investigative timeline showing that the agency had played political favorites with nonprofit groups seeking tax-exempt status,' reports the Daily Mail . 'In 2010, according to that investigation, the Cincinnati-based IRS office responsible for vetting tax-exempt applications began targeting groups with 'Tea Party or similar' words in their names -- including words like 'patriots' and '9/12' -- for tighter scrutiny.' The Obama administration, in other words, has been using the IRS as a political weapon to silence dissent and threaten political enemies. 'This is obviously disturbing,' said Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Committee, in a USA Today article . 'Coming within a week of revelations that the White House lied to the American people about the Benghazi attacks and the IRS targeted conservative Americans for their political beliefs, Americans should take notice that top Obama Administration officials increasingly see themselves as above the law and emboldened by the belief that they don't have to answer to anyone.' Documents reveal the IRS scheme stretched all the way to Washington D.C. IRS offices Apologists of criminal government have described all this criminal IRS activity as nothing but the 'mistakes of a local IRS office' in Cincinnati. But documents just acquired by the Washington Post reveal that the punitive scheme went all the way up the ladder to IRS offices in Washington D.C. 'Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington and at least two other offices were involved with investigating conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, making clear that the effort reached well beyond the branch in Cincinnati that was initially blamed,' reports the Washington Post . It continues: ...details of the IRS's efforts to target conservative groups reached the highest levels of the agency in May 2012, far earlier than has been disclosed, according to Republican congressional aides briefed by the IRS and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration(TIGTA) on the details of their reviews. Countdown to January, 2014 Beginning January, 2014, the IRS will become the enforcement arm of Obamacare . Part of this enforcement will include demanding private health insurance status information and ID numbers from all Americans. Anyone who refuses to provide this information will be financially penalized (i.e. 'fined') an amount that increases each year until it reaches a penalty of $2,085 per family or 2.5% of your income, whichever is greater . How much will it cost you to acquire this Obama-mandated health insurance, exactly? According to cost estimates from 17 of the nation's largest insurance companies , health insurance premiums are set to skyrocket 100% to 400% under Obamacare . This means whatever you're paying now for health insurance -- say $1,000 a month -- double it to $2,000 a month and you begin to get an idea of what Obamacare is really going to cost you. It might actually cost you $4,000 per month! But that's only the beginning. Given that the IRS has proven it is a criminal enterprise that uses its power to intimidate political opponents of the Obama administration, a very likely tactic to be pursued by the agency will include punitive scrutiny of any who refuse to participate in Obamacare mandates . If you refuse to get Obama-mandated health insurance, in other words, and opt to pay the IRS penalty instead, you may be subjected to extra scrutiny by the IRS in exactly the same way conservative non-profits were targeted by the IRS over the last four years. The IRS will, of course, deny their investigations are politically motivated, but after all the recent revelations about the IRS targeting political opponents of Obama, who will believe them? RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Do you really want the IRS digging into your medical history? All this questions the wisdom of putting the IRS in charge of enforcing a health care law. It's going to force all taxpayers to turn over personal medical details to an agency that has already admitted violating federal laws and abusing its power to punish political enemies of the current administration. Have you ever thought about the enormous evil that could be accomplished by the IRS building a database of all Americans' health insurance records? This information could be covertly used by the government to do things like identify everyone taking antidepressant drugs then have them all declared mentally unstable and therefore unqualified to own firearms (as an example). Once the IRS has your health insurance ID information -- which you are required to provide this coming January -- it could use that data to discover if you're seeing an infertility doctor, being treated for cancer, taking antipsychotic drugs, seeking medical treatment for substance abuse, were beaten or molested by a family member, were the victim of a rape assault or any other detail in your medical records. Is this the kind of information you trust the IRS to have on you? Really? And yes, it really is a simple matter for the government to gather all this data. Once you hand over your health insurance ID, the government can simply demand the complete medical records of all Americans from top insurers, then use your social security number to match your income and home address to your detailed medical records. Feeling violated yet? Obamacare subjects us all to government data-rape . Obamacare was passed when most people foolishly trusted the government Obamacare was passed into law during a time when most Americans foolishly believed their government would never lie to them. They trusted Obama to be honest and tell them the truth. They trusted his administration to do what was best for the citizens and the country. Heck, most people believed Obamacare was going to give them 'free health care,' remember? That was the big selling point of the whole thing. What a total con job... Since then, the blinders have come off. People are waking up in droves, and most Americans now realize the Obama administration is wholly dishonest and deceptive. Many people believe it is the most dangerous and destructive administration ever to hold power in American history. The Benghazi fiasco and the IRS being caught red-handed both prove to the American people that the Obama administration is full of liars who cannot be trusted. Suddenly in that context the idea that the IRS is going to be running Obamacare is horrifying. We're going to put this agency in charge of gathering, archiving and then protecting our personal health insurance records? We're going to let the prying eyes of the IRS have full access to private medical and biological details that we wouldn't even share with friends and family members? Something is terribly wrong with this picture. Obamacare may cost democrats the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016 Here's my prediction in all this: Obamacare is so onerous, so costly, so unjust and so widely hated by such a wide swath of Americans that it's going to cost democrats hugely in the 2014 and 2016 elections. Consider these facts about the upcoming 2014 Senate race. The US Senate currently has 53 democrats, 45 republicans and 2 independents. Democrats are clutching to a majority that could be lost if just five seats flip: There are 35 seats up for election in 2014. Twenty-one of those are currently held by democrats. Most states where senators are up for election are Republican-leaning states. By the time the November, 2014 election arrives, people will have already been forced to comply with Obamacare penalties on April 15th of 2014. This will be remembered on voting day. Voters will also remember democrats' attempts to take away their legal and lawful firearms via unconstitutional gun control legislation. The pro Second Amendment vote is going to be powerful and determined in 2014. As Obama's scandals continue to grow, voter disgust will translate into an anti-Obama / anti-democrat vote at the polls. Benghazi is only the tip of the iceberg... By the way, don't misinterpret this article to think I'm rooting for Republicans in 2014. Republicans, too, have proven they will operate as total criminals if they are in control. I only support people who defend and protect liberty , regardless of their party affiliation. Right now that happens to be senators like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, but I welcome any democrats, too, who wish to stop behaving like traitors to the United States and start defending the Bill of Rights for a change. In just 18 months, we'll all have a chance to vote out 35 traitors in the U.S. Senate and replace them with representatives who will uphold their sworn oath to defend the Constitution. For the first time, selfnews plans to endorse U.S. Senate candidates who have solid voting records on key issues like GMO food labeling, vaccine choice for parents and protecting the liberties of the American people. It may be a very short list, but we're going to highlight those who have earned it. "
0," In 2013, the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services killed more than 4 million animals, an ironic twist of fate for an agency that is supposedly charged with preserving and protecting the country's wildlife. The Washington Post reports, the massive toll of wild animals exterminated by the government -- as a service to everything from ranches to airports -- has gone up and down, but last year, the figures were up again: The more than 4 million animals shot, poisoned, snared or trapped by the Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in fiscal year 2013 included 75,326 coyotes, 866 bobcats, 528 river otters, 3,700 foxes, 12,186 prairie dogs, 973 red-tailed hawks, 419 black bears and at least three eagles, golden and bald. For the record, it is against federal law to kill a Bald or Golden Eagle without first obtaining a permit to do so (accompanied by a good reason) from the Interior Secretary. Kill totals up and down but no one says why The Post said that, despite the fact that the USDA maintains a list of animals killed, there is virtually no data showing why each animal was exterminated, the methods used in the killings or the reasons why they were necessary. Also, there isn't much data indicating reasons behind mistakes that have led to massive kills of animals that weren't targeted. At least two members of Congress have described the Wildlife Services as secretive and opaque for failing to provide more information. Further, there are mounting calls for an investigation into how the service operates. Officials with the USDA's Wildlife Services said the agency responds to requests by other government entities nationwide while working to 'resolve human/wildlife conflicts' in a strategic way. 'As wildlife damage increases, requests for assistance also increase,' spokeswoman Carol Bannerman told the Post . She said that ranchers and farmers pay half the costs of the agency's expenses to kill animals that they view as a threat. However, she provided no explanation about why the kill total is as low as 1.5 million in one year but as high as 5 million the next. Around the turn of the 21st century, the agency said it killed about 4 million animals, but two years later, in 2001, the figure fell to 1. 5 million and remained relatively low for about six years. But in 2008, the number rose dramatically, to 5 million, before heading down to 3 million over the next four years, the Post reported. But as evidenced by current figures, the death toll is up again, and critics are looking for a better explanation as to why. According to the Post : Wildlife Services' primary purpose is to eradicate invasive creatures introduced from other parts of the world. They include greedy feral hogs, giant swamp rats called nutria, big aggressive Argentine lizards called tegus and swarms of hungry starlings that destroy the habitats of animals native to the United States. But the agency also kills native animals en masse, sometimes based solely on a homeowner's or farmer's perception of a threat. 'Rogue agency' Birds that inhabit airports and eat cattle feed at farms do contribute to the high totals. Non-invasive European starlings, sparrows, pigeons and the like account for about 87 percent of animals killed. Birds of all kinds are singled out as nuisances, and flocks of them can be particularly hazardous to air travel. But as the Post noted, the current rise in the number of animals being exterminated came despite growing protest and scrutiny. Last December, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition with the government, demanding that the agency provide a better explanation as to why it makes each kill of an animal, who benefited from the killing and the methods used. In the petition, the Center called the Wildlife Services 'a rogue agency' that was 'out of control.' Sources: http://www.washingtonpost.com http://www.ecorazzi.com http://www.predatordefense.org "
0," Ginger naturally contains a compound that is up to 10,000 times more effective than chemotherapy drugs at killing the cancer stem cells that make malignant tumors so dangerous, according to a study published in the journal PLoS . The chemical, known as 6-shogaol, is produced when ginger roots are dried or cooked. The researchers found that 6-shogaol is active against cancer stem cells at concentrations that are harmless to healthy cells. This is dramatically different from conventional chemotherapy, which has serious side effects largely because it kills healthy as well as cancerous cells. Cells responsible for 90 percent of cancer death? Like other stem cells, cancer stem cells possess the ability to differentiate into various different cell types. In the case of cancer, stem cells differentiate into the various malignant cells that make up a tumor colony. Although they make up less than 1 percent of the cells in any given tumor, stem cells are impervious to nearly all known or experimental chemotherapy agents. These cells are also able to replicate indefinitely, and they are capable of splitting off from their originating colony to start new tumors elsewhere. They are key players in the process of metastasis, which is responsible for 90 percent of cancer-related deaths. The persistence of cancer stem cells also explains why cancers can recur even after seemingly successful tumor eradication via chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. 'Cancer stem cells pose serious obstacle to cancer therapy as they can be responsible for poor prognosis and tumour relapse,' the researchers wrote. 'To add into the misery, very few chemotherapeutic compounds show promise to kill these cells.' Kills cancer cells on many fronts The researchers found that 6-shogaol targets breast cancer stem cells along several different pathways, including reducing the expression of surface markers, altering the cell cycle to increase the rate of cell death, inhibiting tumor formation, directly inducing programmed cell death, and flat-out poisoning cancer stem cells (cytotoxicity). The researchers then compared the cytotoxicity of 6-shogaol against human breast cancer stem cells with that of the widely used chemotherapy drug taxol. They found that while taxol did show cytotoxicity in a one-dimensional laboratory model of cancer ('monolayer'), it showed almost no effect in the three-dimensional ('spheroid') model that is now believed to be a more accurate model of real-world cancer tumors. 6-shogaol, however, was effective in both the monolayer and spheroid models. The researchers then increased the taxol concentration by 10,000 times, but it still showed no effectiveness in spheroid model. '[T]axol, even though was highly active in monolayer cells, did not show activity against the spheroids even at 10,000 fold higher concentration compared to 6-shogaol,' the researchers wrote. The promise of food-based cures The fact that 6-shogaol naturally occurs in a widely consumed human food is promising for its safety profile, the researchers noted. 'Dietary compounds are welcome options for human diseases due to their time-tested acceptability by human bodies,' they wrote. Another food-based chemical that has shown promise against cancer stem cells is phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). This chemical is produced from the reaction of a compound and an enzyme that occur in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cabbage. This reaction actually takes place simply when the vegetables are chewed, which means that eating cruciferous vegetables causes the human body to be exposed to PEITC. According to a May 2015 press release by researchers from the South Dakota State University Department of Health and Nutritional Sciences, PEITC has been successful at killing cervical cancer stem cells. The concentrations used in the study are actually achievable simply from a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables, the researchers said. The vegetables highest in PEITC potential are watercress and land cress. This research suggests that PEITC, and possibly even a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables, could assist in the prevention of or recovery from cancer. "
0," The motto is, 'To seek justice, protect civil liberties, and uphold the Constitution.' The mission is: To equip sheriffs, peace officers and public officials with the necessary information and public support to carry out their duties in accordance with their Oaths of Office. And, according to former Graham County, Ariz. Sheriff Richard Mack, the founder of CSPOA - the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association - the goal of his organization is to work on solutions that will preserve the American republic, before it is too late. The genesis of his organization extends to the early 1990s, with the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act , more commonly known as the 'Brady Bill.' The legislation, signed by Bill Clinton in 1993, was the first to require background checks on gun buyers and established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) maintained by the FBI. Fighting the Feds and winning - yes, it can be done When it was first implemented, Mack says state, county and local law enforcement agencies were given their 'orders' on how to implement the law's provisions by federal authorities, guidance to which he took mighty offense: Three federal agents showed up at our AZ Sheriffs Association meeting and handed us each a document from the Dept. of the Treasury, which detailed what our 'orders' were to comply with the Brady bill. All the sheriffs were shocked and against it. However, each sheriff said there was nothing we could do about it, 'you can't fight city hall' was the frequent comment. I disagreed and decided to sue my own government. Everybody said I was crazy and that I could not win. Six other sheriffs from various parts of the USA joined the lawsuit. The case went all the way to the U S Supreme Court and miracle of miracles we won. Constitutional usurpation continues to exist today, Mack says, and, in many respects, the usurpation has gotten worse. 'Now, today, our country is dying and all the experts say we're on the right track or if we are not, that there's nothing we can do about it. I disagree; there is something we can do! Our 'leaders' continually urge us to stay on the Titanic and they count on our ignorance and apathy to keep us on board,' he says. Despite Washington's continued attempts to overstep its bounds, there is a solution, Mack says: Education. 'We are forming the Constitutional Peace Officers Association which will unite all public servants and sheriffs, to keep their word to uphold, defend, protect, preserve, and obey the Constitutions of the United States of America. We already have hundreds of police , sheriffs, and other officials who have expressed a desire to be a part of this Holy Cause of Liberty,' he says. 'Last line of defense' 'We are going to train and vet them all, state by state, to understand and enforce the constitutionally protected Rights of the people they serve, with an emphasis on State Sovereignty and local autonomy,' he said. 'Then these local governments will issue our new Declaration to the Federal Government regarding the abuses that we will no longer tolerate or accept. Said declaration will be enforced by our Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers. In short, the CSPOA will be the army to set our nation free.' Quoting the drafter of the Declaration of Independence and the country's third president, Thomas Jefferson, Mack said his organization 'will unite the sheriffs, police, and local officials who are willing and courageous enough to join us in the 'tempestuous sea of liberty.'' Mack's organization has also produced a six-DVD volume called 'Last Line of Defense,' in which he and other experts explain nearly all elements of the U.S. Constitution , as well as the 'fundamental issues that plague our three branches of government.' While it's not clear at this point whether Mack's organization will ultimately be successful, it's patently obvious that individuals on their own lack the resources, if not the will, to stand up to federal overreach and abuse of power. Any organization that seeks to become a rallying point for that purpose deserves our support. Source: http://cspoa.org/ "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Recently in a Dear Heloise article, a pet owner wrote she buys treats at a Dollar store for $1 that are 'almost the same as $5 treats from the pet store.' Unfortunately for this pet owner, discounted dog treats might cost her far more in the long run. The old adage 'you get what you pay for' usually holds true with pet foods and treats. Discount store pet foods and treats are no exception. Typically, 'Dollar stores' purchase lots of soon to be outdated/expired goods for pennies on the dollar, and then sell cheap hoping to retail all before the expiration date. Some discount stores also purchase lots of imported 'look alike' goods. The red flag for pet owners would be Chinese imported look alike pet foods and treats. However, either way, the pet isn't being provided with much of a treat. For explanation's sake, let's say that the $1 bag of dog treats is called Fido's Best Chicken Flavored Natural Dog Treats; the bag contains 20 small dog treat pieces, 20 ounces. Just as with pet foods, it is legal for the manufacturer to make 'unqualified claims either directly or indirectly' on the pet treat label; Fido's Best Natural might not be 'best' and probably isn't all 'natural'. Let's assume that the discount store purchased the treats for $.50 per bag. If half of the price is manufacturer labor, packaging, and markup expense, each 20 ounce bag of treats contains $.25 worth of ingredients. Now, if the ingredients cost only $.25 per 20 ounces or 1.2 cents per ounce (about $.19 per pound), how much quality nutrition can this treat actually provide your pet? According to AAFCO regulations, pet treats are only supplemental to the diet; very few labeling or ingredient rules apply to pet treats. So, if a pet food can contain chicken feet and cow intestines and be dubbed Natural Pet Food, just imagine what is allowed with pet treats and what quality of ingredients can be in them. At 1.2 cents per ounce cost for ingredients, you can safely assume the discount treats have only the cheapest left over, garbage ingredients and/or the cheapest of the cheap imported ingredients. Even purchasing bulk ingredients ($380.00 per ton) only the cheapest ingredients could be included in these treats. Either way, there is no actual nutrition provided to your pet and/or your pet's health could be at risk from consuming them. The other concern of purchasing discount store pet foods and treats is pet owners purchasing expired products. Expired treats or foods can make your pet sick costing you far more in vet bills than the savings from the discounted prices. If you're ever tempted, if you ever let the thought into your conscious that it's just treats, they won't hurt anything, even if they're cheap my dog or cat will eat them regardless, just consider for a moment what you are giving your pet. Cheap treats (and foods) can ONLY mean the cheapest of ingredients, the poorest quality of ingredients. Don't be tempted. One mistake from the manufacturer that makes foods or treats using the cheapest of ingredients could cost your pet's life and/or thousands in vet bills. If you need to save money on treats, give your pet green beans, carrot and apple slices, or spoonfuls of canned pumpkin. These are inexpensive and provide your pet with some nutrition.

0," A pair of globalist-minded academics is arguing for an idea that, just a few short years ago, was derided as conspiratorial -- and by the same cable news outlet where the two are making their case: CNN. In an online column for the Cable News Network, Andres Martinez -- editorial director of Zocalo Public Square and professor of practice at the Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University -- and Daniel Kurtz-Phelan -- an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow at New America and a former adviser on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's policy planning staff -- argue for a European-style merger between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, though CNN attempted to ridicule former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, for his previous mention of a North American Union. As reported by The New American magazine in its online edition, the recent op-ed by Martinez and Kurtz-Phelan, on behalf of New America, a globalist-centric think tank, the future of the U.S. 'lies in North America,' not in the Constitution or the American people. 'This is not a geographic truism, but a strategic imperative,' they argued. 'The United States, Canada and Mexico are bound by a shared economic, environmental, demographic and cultural destiny.' Borders are quaint anachronisms As further reported by TNA: In recognition of what they refer to as North America's 'shared destiny,' Martinez and Kurtz-Phelan propose the establishment of what they call a 'North American passport.' The radical passport scheme would eventually facilitate the erasing of U.S. borders in exchange for 'North American' borders -- a plot that has been underway for years with the 'Beyond the Border' initiative and other schemes. 'Much like the EU passport,' they said, the new North American passport would ultimately allow all North American residents to 'travel, work, invest, learn and innovate anywhere in North America .' On its website, New America states the organization 'is dedicated to the renewal of American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the digital age through big ideas, technological innovation, next generation politics, and creative engagement with broad audiences.' The scholars argue that prior continent-wide economic ties through mechanisms like the North American Free Trade Agreement have enriched all three countries and have inextricably tied them together for the long haul. What's more, the duo derides traditional boundaries between countries as quaint anachronisms that have no place in the modern era; sovereignty, to them, is an relic of the Old World. This is especially true as it pertains to North American energy resources, they argue. Such resources 'must be leveraged regionally, with cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning. 'Even if Washington still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states,' they continued, 'mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the Colorado River.' Where is the outcry for such a plan? As for America's 'illegal immigration problem,' the academics argue that a North American passport would alleviate the issue as a political football. 'We have more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in this country because we didn't create a realistic, legal avenue for the number of Mexicans who would -- and should, given our level of integration -- come to the United States over time,' they wrote. 'Moreover, by erecting a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult, costly and dangerous, we have interrupted the old 'circularity' of migratory flows, trapping millions of workers on this side of the border.' There is no mention in the op-ed about the drain on U.S. taxpayers such migration would inevitably create, given the political realities of Mexico's narco-state. And while there is much promise south of the border, at present there is little effort on the part of Mexico City to eradicate drug cartels which control much of the countryside, and who spread violence and terror to many of Mexico's 100 million people. For now, there appears to be little domestic appetite for such an integrative plan, which also assumes that the Mexican and Canadian people would even favor it. One thing is certain, however: As long as U.S. politicians continue to define the issue as one in which the wealthiest of the three countries involved will have to sacrifice the most in order for such a plan to succeed, they will play havoc selling it to the American people. For the record, during the 2008 GOP presidential nomination process, CNN allowed a viewer to ask then-candidate Ron Paul if he really subscribed to the 'conspiracy theory' about efforts to construct a North American Union -- a question which was designed to make him look absurd, but one in which he ultimately answered well. That exchange is here . Sources: http://www.thenewamerican.com http://www.cnn.com http://www.newamerica.org https://www.youtube.com "
0," As with many cities, water fluoridation has become an emotionally charged topic in Austin, Texas, as doctors, scientists, activists and members of the community continue to push back against the city's long-time practice of medicating the public against their will. Hydrofluorosilicic acid, industrial waste that is a byproduct of the phosphate industry, is routinely added to the city's water. Taxpayers cough up more than $300K each year for the measure. As I reported earlier on selfnews , last week, Austin's Public Utilities Committee, which is authorized to review matters related to the city's water utility, met to consider a resolution to stop water fluoridation. A host of well-qualified experts spoke against the measure, highlighting the dangers posed by the industrial chemical. Speaking against the practice was local dentist Dr. Griffin Cole, Environmental Scientist Dr. Neil Carman, former candidate for Austin City Council Dr. Laura Pressley, Executive Director of Texans for Accountable Government (TAG) Justin Arman, Fluoride-Free Austin Founder Rae Nadler-Olenick and her colleague Linda Green. More than 50 pages of scientific reviews and studies detailing the adverse health impacts of water fluoridation were presented at Wednesday's meeting, leaving committee members visibly confused and questioning their moral compass as several of them seemed to reconsider their stance on fluoride. City of Austin employee Janet Pichette struggles to defend water fluoridation while her faces twists in fear and confusion Sent to defend the city's fluoridation practices, Ruth Burazer, Assistant Director of Austin Water Utility, and Janet Pichette, Chief Epidemiologist for Austin's Health and Human Services Department said that water fluoridation has no adverse health effects as long as the fluoride levels are 'optimal.' Pitchette's testimony was somewhat painful to watch as she struggled to relay her thoughts, with her face twisting in fear and confusion as she tried to address the committee's concerns. Click here and select 'Item 4' to view her testimony. Pitchette and Burazer maintained that Austin's fluoride levels are in 'full compliance' with the Public Health Department, which were recently lowered from 1.2 parts per million to a maximum of 0.7 ppm, a level that's still been proven to cause health problems, particularly in infants and young children. Pitchette insisted that there are no health problems associated with fluoridation and that it's necessary to prevent tooth decay in children. However, Griffin Cole, DDS, a local celebrity dentist, disagrees. Tooth decay has declined around the world, and not just in places with water fluoridation, said Dr. Cole during his presentation. 'There has never been a single randomized controlled study that demonstrates the effectiveness of water fluoridation,' he said. Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits , '[F]luoride's predominant effect is posteruptive and topical.' 'We are unaware of data... about the additional protection from tooth decay that could result [from consumption of fluoridated drinking water],' wrote the CDC in 2012 . [PDF] Bottle-fed babies exposed to 175 times the level of fluoride naturally found in breast milk Both Dr. Cole and Dr. Carman warned that infants are the most at risk for developing health problems caused by water fluoridation, which impacts the thyroid gland, causing neurological impairment. Lower IQs, dental and skeletal fluorosis, and discoloration of the teeth are also caused by water fluoridation. One of the biggest backers of fluoride, the American Dental Association (ADA), said in 2006, 'If liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition, it should be mixed with water that is fluoride free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis.' Why is it that the entire city of Austin is being treated with what Austin considers to be a drug, without ever being seen by a physician? How can they possibly get the dose correct for everyone? 'Due to their small size, infants receive up to 400% more fluoride (per pound of body weight) than adults consuming the same level of fluoride in water,' according to Fluoridealert.org . 'Not only do infants receive a larger dose, they have an impaired ability to excrete fluoride through their kidneys.' Mass-medicating an involuntary public is also against the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics regarding informed consent, which states : The patient should make his or her own determination about treatment. ... Informed consent is a basic policy in both ethics and law that physicians must honor, unless the patient is unconscious or otherwise incapable of consenting and harm from failure to treat is imminent.

0," Smokers in general underestimate the power of processed, chemical-laden foods, chemical-laden drinks and chemical-laden personal care products to put their body in an acidic state, which makes them rely on nicotine even more for temporary relief of their 'chemical hangover.' When smokers do finally quit, whether by cold turkey in a single day or by means of some program or medication, the number one event that sends a smoker back to the 'well' is stress. Hands down, a walloping of stress comes along and most new non-smokers say the same thing: 'I sure could use a cigarette right about now.' Little do most people know, including non-smokers with bad eating habits, that toxic food, drinks and skin care can lead a person right into depression, anxiety, panic attacks and basic ill health. Certain combinations of food additives, like MSG and aspartame for example, can send a person's CNS (central nervous system) into a tail-spin and drive migraine headaches, IBS and more. Plus, GMO foods wreck your immunity, because nothing kills your good bacteria (flora) in your gut faster than pesticides and insecticides. Add in some bleached foods and wash it down with some fluoridated water and what have you got? A very NEGATIVE feeling person who loses enthusiasm and the ability to deal with anything stressful. When they get overwhelmed, most new non-smokers will either share, bum or take a drag from someone's cigarette at a bar or a house party and then that's 'all she wrote.' Within weeks or even days, they're back to a pack a day or more. Avoiding relapse Cancer survives ONLY in an acidic environment, meaning inside your low-pH body, and blood and tissues. Cancer dies when your cells get oxygen and can breathe, becoming alkaline. What deprives your cells of oxygen? Sodium benzoate, canola oil and GMO pesticide-laden corn, soy and sugar beets (MSG) choke your mitochondria and mutate your genes. Common chemicals in personal care products and cosmetics cause cancer, like phthalates, parabens and sodium lauryl sulfate. There's lead in lipstick and arsenic in conventional chicken. There are hormones in milk and MSG in vaccines . Is it too overwhelming for you too keep up? You know what's too overwhelming -- chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and BAD advice . Western Medicine is full of bad advice. It's how the medical-industrial complex stays in business. What gives your cells oxygen? Organic vegetables, organic fruit and real spring water. For power boosters, eat kale and hemp seed oil. Then get some organic spinach, organic chards and aloe. Check into the amino acids, especially the branched-chains (BCAAs). Use baking soda to bring up your alkalinity and take Epsom salt baths to pull toxins from the body. When you quit smoking, guard your 'food gates' against chemicals! Avoid consuming white foods that are bleached -- like white flour, rice, sugar, bread and pasta, for starters -- and consuming ammonia -- which is found in most conventional meat, because the CAFO farmers and butchers use it to kill bacteria. Remember, 'junk science' is DESIGNED to hook you and your kids on refined sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and monosodium glutamate -- MSG. It's designed to make you feel like you need medicine or cigarettes to lessen the anxiety, the depression, the stress. But you don't. You need nutrition. You need to build your nutrient base and alkalize your body. No relapse for you - instead you'll be smoke-free for life! The very second you decide to quit smoking, you must do these two things: replace and replenish. That means you must replace your bad behavioral rituals of breathing in toxins with breathing in fresh air during your 'breaks.' You must replace that 'hand-to-mouth' ritual with organic snacks and spring water. You must replenish your nutrient base with organic vegetables, fruits and proper supplementation via superfoods and Health Ranger-recommended minerals. This is your journey, and you have complete control. Make it a healthy, happy, sharing journey. Quit smoking naturally now. ( http://programs.selfnews.com ) "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A glucosamine-like dietary supplement has been found to suppress the damaging autoimmune response seen in multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, according to University of California, Irvine health sciences researchers. In studies on mice, Dr. Michael Demetriou and colleagues with the UC Irvine Center for Immunology found that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which is similar but more effective than the widely available glucosamine, inhibited the growth and function of abnormal T-cells that incorrectly direct the immune system to attack specific tissues in the body, such as brain myelin in MS and insulin-producing cells of the pancreas in diabetes. Study results appear on the online version of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. 'This finding shows the potential of using a dietary supplement to help treat autoimmune diseases,' said Demetriou, an assistant professor of neurology, and microbiology and molecular genetics. 'Most importantly, we understand how this sugar-based supplement inhibits the cells that attack the body, making metabolic therapy a rational approach to prevent or treat these debilitating diseases.' The UC Irvine study defines how metabolic therapy with the sugar GlcNAc and other related nutrients modifies the growth and autoimmune activitiy of T-cells. Virtually all proteins on the surface of cells, including T-cells, are modified with complex sugars of variable lengths and composition. Recent studies have shown that changes in these sugars are often associated with T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmune disease. In mouse models of both MS and type 1 diabetes , Demetriou and colleages found that GlcNAc prevented this hyperactivity and autoimmune response by increasing sugar modifications to the T-cell proteins. This therapy normalized T-cell function and prevented development of paralysis in MS and high blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes. This study comes on the heels of others showing the potential of GlcNAc in humans. One previous clinical study reported that 8 of 12 children with treatment-resistant autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease improved significantly following two years of treatment with GlcNAc. No significant adverse side effects were noted. 'Together, these findings identify metabolic therapy using dietary supplements such as GlcNAc as potential treatments for autoimmune diseases.' Demetriou said. 'Excitement for this treatment strategy stems from the novel mechanism for affecting T-cell function and autoimmunity and the availability and simplicity of its use. However, additional studies in humans will be required to assess the full potential of this therapeutic approach.' Autoimmune diseases such as MS and type 1 diabetes mellitus result from poorly understood interactions between inherited genetic risk and environmental exposure. MS results in neurological dysfunction, while uncontrolled blood glucose in type 1 diabetes can lead to damage of multiple organs. Ani Grigorian, Sung-Uk Lee, Wenqiang Tian, I-Ju Chen and Guoyan Gao of UC Irvine and Richard Mendelsohn and James W. Dennis of the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute in Toronto participated in the study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Wadsworth Foundation and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.

0," A new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine (formerly Archives of Internal Medicine ) has revealed that taking statin drugs for high cholesterol increases one's risk of developing memory loss. But the mainstream media, funded in large part by pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars in profits at stake, is claiming the exact opposite in order to trick the not-so-bright into continuing to take these deadly, ineffective drugs. The paper, entitled 'Statin Therapy and Risk of Acute Memory Impairment,' compared the health outcomes of nearly 500,000 statin users to the same number of matched non-users of statins. The study also looked at the health outcomes of users of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, or LLDs, in order to make a comparison among all these groups as to the effects of statins, LLDs and no treatment at all on memory loss. Researchers from both Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania observed that memory loss rates were roughly equal among patients taking statins and patients taking LLDs, which some news outlets are claiming means that the drugs are both safe and effective. But non-users of either drug fared significantly better in the memory department than both users of statins and users of LLDs, suggesting quite the opposite: that both cholesterol-lowering drug classes lead to memory loss. The paper itself puts it this way: 'Both statin and nonstatin LLDs were strongly associated with acute memory loss in the first 30 days following exposure in users compared with nonusers but not when compared with each other. Thus, either all LLDs cause acute memory loss regardless of drug class or the association is the result of detection bias rather than a causal association.' Don't listen to science, says mainstream media: Statins are perfectly safe and effective because we say so Not surprisingly, detection bias was the explanation chosen by industry whores like TIME , CBS News , Business Standard and many others, who published ridiculous headlines like 'Statins don't pose threat to your memory ' and 'Study: Statins not to blame for memory loss.' Such deception has been circulating the corporate news circles in recent days, declaring precisely the opposite of what the study actually found. But this is typical of the mass news media, which relies on advertising dollars from the very same companies that peddle statins and LLDs as beneficial. If the mainstream media were to present an honest assessment of the situation -- that statins and LLDs can, and probably do, destroy people's brains -- their sponsors like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Merck & Co. might threaten to put their fortunes elsewhere. Consequently, Americans and others who peruse American media are left with the false impression that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs are completely safe and effective. It's the same manipulative tactic used by vaccine pushers to keep the masses from jumping ship to protect their children -- all vaccines are safe and effective, these industry prostitutes claim, regardless of what the science actually says! Statins linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CoQ10 depletion, cancer and more It was recently exposed in the journal Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology that statins don't even work, by the way. Statin manufacturers have refined the art of pseudoscientific deception, researchers found, using what they call 'statistical deception' to create the illusion that statins are safe and effective. This industry sleight of hand also masks the serious harms posed by these quack drugs. One of these harms is diabetes, which a recent study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found is a common adverse effect triggered by statin drug use. The study's lead author is quoted as saying that statin use is associated 'with a significantly higher risk of new-onset diabetes, even in a very healthy population.' Heart disease is another consequence of statin use. Two separate studies published in the journal Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology found that, rather than reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is their claim to fame, statins actually increase this risk. They do this by depleting the body of coenzyme Q10, an antioxidant that the human body needs to produce energy and perform cellular functions. 'The adverse effects suffered by people taking statins are more common than reported in the media and at medical conferences,' wrote Dr. David M. Diamond and his colleague Dr. Uffe Ravnskov, two University of South Florida (USF) scientists, in their paper on statins published in the journal Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology . 'Increased rates of cancer, cataracts, diabetes, cognitive impairments and musculoskeletal disorders more than offset the modest cardiovascular benefits of statin treatment.' Dr. Stephanie Seneff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has published her own research as well into the statin scam. Some of her work is available here: People.CSAIL.MIT.edu .

0," Another day, another headline about the dangers of a synthetic chemical in our food... This time it's PFOA, or perfluoroalkyl acid -- the non-stick chemical used on cookware surfaces. According to a study just published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , high levels of PFOA were strongly correlated with an increase in both total cholesterol and LDL 'bad' cholesterol. Typically, high cholesterol is treated with a second chemical intervention -- statin drugs. Statins can produce devastating side effects including kidney and liver damage ( http://selfnews.com/statins.html ), muscle weakness and eye problems. So now we have a situation where people ingesting PFOA chemicals may be inaccurately diagnosed with cholesterol problems and be prescribed dangerous chemical medications that cause even more health problems. This study looked at 12,000 children who were exposed to PFOA through their local water supply which was contaminated with PFOA. It does not prove a link between non-stick cookware and cholesterol, although it suggests a possible link that should probably be researched further. PFOA is on more than just cooking pans PFOA isn't merely found on cooking pans, by the way: Nearly all cooking surfaces for electric consumer food prep appliances are made with it: Sandwich toasters, griddles and even popular cooking devices such as George Foreman Grills. You'll also get PFOA from most restaurants because non-stick cooking surfaces are commonly used to prepare your omelets, pancakes, pasta sauces and many other menu items. Avoiding PFOA is nearly impossible unless you prepare all your own food at home, and even then, you must be extremely careful with what food prep devices you use. Even Swiss Diamond pans which claim that you're 'cooking on diamonds' are actually made with PFOA chemicals ( http://www.selfnews.com/021059.html ). I have avoided non-stick cookware for many years and wouldn't dare prepare any food on such an item made with dangerous chemicals, but most consumers don't know about the dangers of PFOA, and they continue to cook their food with non-stick pans. It gets really dangerous when people use forks or metal spatulas to stir their food in such pans because this action scrapes off microscopic bits of PFOA chemicals that then become lodged in their food and swallowed. My advice is to avoid all non-stick cookware . Buy stainless steel cookware with copper plating on the bottom, which helps disperse heat and prevent burning. Better yet, eat more raw foods and superfood smoothies which require no cooking whatsoever. The mere act of cooking food in a pan, after all, creates carcinogens in the food. The only 'safely' cooked food is steamed or boiled. Anything that subjects foods to very high temperatures -- frying, broiling, grilling, etc. -- results in the creation of cancer-causing chemicals in the food itself.

As reported by agriculture website Capital Press , Syngenta attempted to employ a 100-plus-year-old warehouse law to force the elevator company, Bunge, to accept the GM corn. The ruling may preempt other makers of GM seeds and crops from using the same litigation tactic against grain elevators that have refused to harbor crops with altered transgenic traits, according to experts. Controversy began in 2011, Capital Press reported, after Bunge operators refused to accept the Syngenta Seeds-produced Agrisure Viptera variety of corn. The elevator operators told farmers growing the GMO strain that they could not take it because it had yet to clear legal and regulatory requirements in all major export destinations. At the time, the strain had yet to be accepted by the Chinese government. 'You don't have a private cause of action' Capital Press noted: In response, Syngenta filed a lawsuit accusing Bunge of violating the U.S. Warehouse Act of 1916, which requires elevators to treat depositors fairly. Farmers who grew Viptera corn had to ship their crops to other elevators and find other sources of corn to fulfill their contracts with Bunge, which hurt Syngenta's reputation and market share, the biotech company claimed. However, judges on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Syngenta's suit, saying that the agri-giant lacked any 'cause of action' to bring the case against Bunge. Now, farmers who were affected by the appeals court decision still have the right to sue Bunge, but the court's ruling nonetheless prevents, for now, similar suits by Monsanto, Dow, DuPont or other GMO seed manufacturers, Drew Kershen, a University of Oklahoma agricultural biotechnology law professor, told the website. 'This seems to say to them, you don't have a private cause of action,' he said. 'They would be in the same position as Syngenta.' Kershen further told the website that, even if a farmer affected by the ruling does file suit against Bunge over its Viptera corn rejection, the chances that the suit will be successful are far from clear, noting that it's unknown whether an elevator's obligation to be 'fair and reasonable' means it could not reject certain strains and breeds of corn. 'There's no case law, there's no USDA interpretation, there's no clarity on what those terms mean,' said Kershen. 'There has been nothing to discuss this in all the decades of this law.' Biotech critics have viewed the dispute between Syngenta and Bunge as a warning regarding concerns over the impact of GM corn and other crops on export markets. 'They can't be forced to take them' 'It's another example of the economic harm to farmers that can come from transgenic contamination,' George Kimbrell, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety, a non-profit that has litigated over biotech crops, told Capital Press . He added that the federal appeals court ruling coincides with the principle that businesses that choose not to purchase genetically engineered crops 'can't be forced to take them.' However, GMO backers have said that the case highlights the need for so-called equalization of standards for such crops among countries that import them. In a perfect world, one harmonized method of approval would permit the shipment of GM crops to all countries that import crops instead of having to be approved by each nation individually, Mary Boote, executive director of the Truth about Trade and Technology, a non-profit organization that supports GM crops, told Capital Press . 'That's a big goal but an important one,' she said. Such an agreement would likely have to take the form of an international accord or a treaty. Capital Press reported that, since the dispute began in 2011, China has ratcheted up its rejection of the Viptera corn strain by also rejecting dried distillers grains, an ethanol byproduct, which contain the trait.

0," Whether you've been diagnosed with a peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or just have some annoying heartburn from time to time, the odds are your doctor or pharmacist has pushed you towards drugs like Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium. All are a variety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the most potent inhibitors of stomach acid secretion currently on the market as both prescription and non-presciption drugs. But evidence is mounting that these medications can lead to some troublesome and even serious side effects. In fact, a new study just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) concludes that by disrupting the body's natural balance, PPIs may cause deadly pneumonia. Pis are now among the most widely-selling drugs in the world and are frequently given to hospitalized patients to prevent or treat heartburn. Background information in the JAMA article estimates between 40 percent and 70 percent of hospitalized patients receive some form of these drugs -- even though the medications are often used for indications not supported by data and research. And now comes a study headed by Shoshana J. Herzig, M.D., of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston showing this practice appears to be downright dangerous. The reason? Hospitalized patients given acid-suppressive medications have a hugely increased risk of developing pneumonia while in the hospital. Dr. Herzig and colleagues studied data on patients who were admitted to a large, urban, academic medical center between January 2004 and December 2007. These were patients who were at least 18 years of age, hospitalized for three or more days, and not so sick they had to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Acid-suppressive medication use was defined as any order for a proton-pump inhibitor or another acid blocking type of drug known as a histamine2 receptor antagonist (used less frequently than PPIs). In all, the researchers investigated data on 63,878 hospital admissions and found that 52 percent were given acid-suppressing medication. The majority, almost 90 percent, were placed on these drugs within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital. Of the group who received these medications, 27,236 (83 percent) received PPIs and 7,548 (23 percent) received histamine2 receptor antagonists. Some were actually given both kinds of stomach acid fighting drugs. The scientists at first documented that 2,219 of the patients (3.5 percent) developed hospital-acquired pneumonia and this risk was far higher in the group exposed to acid-suppressive medication relative to the unexposed group (almost five percent compared to two percent). But after the researchers conducted further analysis and adjusted for potential factors that could influence the outcomes, they concluded that receiving acid-suppressive medications was associated with a dramatic 30 percent increase in the odds of coming down with hospital-acquired pneumonia. There was no similar increase in the patients who only received the histamine2 receptor antagonists. So how could drugs that supposedly control acid production in the stomach have anything to do with germs infecting the lungs? The researchers join other scientists who have raised an alarm that these acid-suppressive medications cause changes in the body's natural balance of micro flora (the balance between the 'good' and potentially 'bad' bacteria that live inside all of us). Specifically, PPIs may well increase the risk of pneumonia because they modify upper gastrointestinal bacteria, and, in turn, modify respiratory bacteria. The result can be that disease-causing bacteria are not kept under control and pneumonia develops. 'These results occur in the context of an increasing body of literature suggesting an association between acid-suppressive medication and pneumonia. Further scrutiny is warranted regarding inpatient prescribing practices of these medications,' the study authors concluded in a statement to the media. Other dangers of PPI drugs A host of other health problems have been linked to PPIs recently. The University of Maryland Medical Center web site notes that long-term use of high-dose PPIs may produce vitamin B12 deficiencies and that these drugs have also been linked to an increased risk of hip fractures. In fact, as covered earlier this year in selfnews ( http://www.selfnews.com/025369.html ), taking PPIs for five years or more has been correlated with a 62 percent increase in the risk of osteoporosis-related hip fractures, while use for seven years or more has been correlated with a risk increase of more than 400 percent. More bad news about PPIs: research presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention earlier this month concluded that taking drugs like Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec and Protonix can be dangerous for heart patients who are also taking anti-clotting medications. PPIs were found to boost the risk of heart attack and stroke in these people by 50 percent. Fortunately, many natural alternatives are available to help with heartburn, GERD and even ulcers. A recent selfnews article ( http://www.selfnews.com/026245.html ) reported, for example, on research published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology that indicates an herb long used in Mediterranean cuisine known as Eruca sativa (also called rocket or arugula) could be a safe alternative to PPIs.

0," Around 17 million people in the United States alone have asthma. It is the number one cause of chronic illness in children. Despite the wide range of medications made as treatment for asthma, the number of people affected by asthma increased by 2.5 million in the US over the past five years. Alternative options from acupuncture to breathing exercises are available for the management of asthma. Doctors may disagree with alternative recommendations for how to treat asthma but unlike medications lifestyle remedies do not harmful side effects. What is asthma? Asthma is characterized by breathing trouble, coughing and wheezing. A person with asthma is subject to episode constriction of their bronchial tubes. A severe attack can even be fatal. The reason behind the constriction of the bronchial tubes is not known, but some triggers include respiratory infection, exercise and emotional disturbances. Alternative therapies and treatment for asthma Bodywork, acupuncture and biofeedback all show promise in the management of asthma. Rolfing and osteopathic manipulation are two types of bodywork that can be performed on the chest area to break up restrictive patterns in muscles and nerves, which are common in people with chronic asthma. An acupuncturist can develop an individual form of treatment for asthmatics. Research has demonstrated that acupuncture can significantly decrease the frequency of asthma attacks and improve breathing. Biofeedback teaches people how to control their heart rate and therefore may be useful in the management of asthma. Biofeedback also can reduce stress, which is a common trigger for asthma. How to treat asthma with breathing techniques A series of breathing exercises beneficial for asthmatics was discovered in 1952 by Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko, MD. The exercises are known as the Buteyko Breathing Technique. Dr. Buteyko surmised that over-breathing is a significant factor in the development of asthma and other breathing difficulties. To help asthma sufferers breathe more easily, Dr. Buteyko developed a system of shallow-breathing exercises. Shallow breathing elevates levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. Carbon dioxide may help to dilate smooth muscles in the airways. At least one large study found that the Buteyko Breathing Technique reduced asthma symptoms. People were also able to rely less on their inhalers. Management of asthma through management of stress Stress can trigger an asthma attack. Alternative treatment for asthma frequently involves relaxing activities. Yoga, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation may all aid in the management of asthma through reducing stress. Deep breathing exercises can be relaxing too, but may trigger asthma symptoms in some people. Asthma guidelines for the home People spend 90 percent of their lives indoors. Therefore it is particularly important for asthmatics to have as few respiratory irritants, including dust, smoke and mold, floating around their home as possible. Irritants like to hide in carpets, drapes, mattresses and furniture. These items should be cleaned frequently and replaced whenever possible with hypoallergenic alternatives. High-quality air purifiers can reduce pollutants in the home. Himalayan salt lamps also help clean the air because they attract water vapor, which pulls irritants along with it as the vapor travels to the lamp where it then dissolves on contact. Certain houseplants purify the air too. Palms and rubber plants are just some of the houseplants that clean the air. "
0," A food activist organization has filed suit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleging that one of its agencies is in violation of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provisions after failing to provide requested documents. The Center for Food Safety, in its suit against the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, said the agency has ignored FOIA requests for records related to genetically engineered crops by unlawfully delaying responses and withholding public disclosure of information. As reported by Sustainable Pulse , the suit charges that APHIS has failed to provide timely responses to at least 29 separate FOIA requests or appeals. In addition, the suit claims that of those cases, the agency has failed to provide a final response to ten requests and two appeals. The suit is asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order APHIS to promptly provide the center with requested information and to further order the agency to end its practice of failing to respond in a timely manner to future FOIA requests for GMO-related data. Violating the public's right to know 'APHIS has a track record of irresponsible and inadequate regulation of GE crops. In the absence of thorough government oversight, public access to information about these crops becomes all the more critical,' said Cristina Stella, staff attorney for Center for Food Safety. 'This lawsuit is necessary to stop APHIS from continuing to ignore its duty to provide the public with information that affects farmers, communities, and the environment.' As Sustainable Pulse reported, GMO crops have caused agronomic and environmental damage, including the transgenic contamination of traditional and organic crops. In addition, studies show they can have negative health implications. Here are just a few examples: "
0," Every once in a while, attending a dinner party becomes the best thing you've done in days. Great company and amazing food are always the premise of a successful evening, but a delicious meal is not always followed by instant satisfaction. In fact, one in five Americans have to suffer the consequences of heartburn. If it's a common issue, you're already reaching for those antacids. Every drug has its downsides, but did you know that there might be a link between indigestion medication and Alzheimer's? The German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease in Bonn examined insurance data on people aged over 75 and came to the conclusion that there's a strong link between heartburn medication and dementia. Their statistics indicate that patients who used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) , a type of medication associated with strong acid reflux, at least once every three months were 44% more likely to experience neurological damage that leads to dementia. Now would be a good time to re-think your strategy of dealing with acid reflux. Yet another heartburn medication side effect However, the scientists in the German study were unable to identify precisely why PPIs are associated with such a significantly higher risk of dementia. A possible theory is that these drugs result in vitamin B12 deficiencies and therefore caus consumers to manifest symptoms that are identical to Alzheimer's disease . The authors' findings are also supported by another study conducted back in 2013 on proton pump inhibitors. The latter effectively proved that when you treat mice with this type of heartburn medication, they develop high levels of amyloid plaques. These plaques play a crucial role in the on-set of Alzheimer's. Antacids, which are also commonly used to treat heartburn, are no better. Although they are essentially different from PPIs, they can easily cause constipation, diarrhea, bloating and even worsen your condition . That's correct. Heartburn medication can actually increase your levels of stomach acid once you are done taking it. People still cling to missing links In spite of compelling evidence, Dr. Laura Phipps, a member of Alzheimer's Research UK, declared that the study doesn't prove the increased risk of dementia is actually caused by PPIs. According to her, other factors may have contributed to the results and we should not jump to rash conclusions. Nevertheless, according to the Daily Mail , even she acknowledged that '[s]tudies like this, which harness large amounts of medical data to highlight trends in health and dis-ease, are incredibly useful to inform future, detailed, follow-up studies into risk factors for conditions like dementia. When any drug is taken, doctors, pharmacists and patients have to weigh up the benefits against the potential side effects and further studies into this area will help to better inform these decisions.' Next time you're looking to get rid of your heartburn, keep in mind the consequences that indigestion drugs can have on your body. While some of them have been proven beyond any doubt, others are highly possible, but yet to be officially confirmed by the authorities. A pill is the quick way out, but it does not make sense for your health in the long run. Treat your body naturally Instead of running to your general practitioner for a prescription, why not try to cure your acid reflux and digestion problems naturally ? You can try out natural remedies, but also make changes to your lifestyle that will ultimately cure your ache without these potentially disastrous side effects. In another couple of years, the link between these drugs and dementia might be irrevocably proven. If that's the case, is it worth risking your sanity for a condition that can easily be cured in an alternative way? Sources include : DailyMail.co.uk ArchNeur.JAMANetwork.com Journals.PLOS.org "
0," The recent death of pop icon Whitney Houston has once again sparked worldwide awareness of the fragility of human life, and how easily it can slip away in an instant. But what Houston's death has also brought to the forefront is the reality that, under the auspices of treating disease, FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs are a primary cause of death in the U.S ., as well as within the entertainment industry. Over the years, selfnews has covered the deaths of numerous celebrities, singers, actors, and cultural icons that met their fates because of prescription drug overdoses. Some of these individuals died as a result of misusing pharmaceutical drugs, while others were literally out of their minds as a result of taking them, which made them particularly prone to the careless and even suicidal behaviors that ultimately led to their deaths. Below we have put together a short timeline of celebrity deaths caused by pharmaceutical drugs. While we recognize that some of these individuals deliberately misused both prescription and illicit drugs, resulting in their deaths, some of them were arguably heavily influenced by these highly-addictive drugs in the first place, which caused them to further abuse dangerous, but legal, prescription drugs, and often under the guidance of their doctors. 1962: American actress, singer, and model Marilyn Monroe reportedly died of a barbiturate overdose, a class of drugs that artificially induces relaxation and sleep. Though the precise details of her death are still disputed, her death was officially declared to be 'acute barbiturate poisoning.' 1968: Famous American actor Nick Adams , a good friend of James Dean and Elvis Presley, reportedly died of an overdose of barbiturates as well. His mysterious death was officially certified as 'accidental-suicidal and undetermined,' but high levels of sedatives were found in his blood. 1977: Iconic singer Elvis Presley had a long history of prescription drug abuse, having developed an addiction to stimulants during his days in the military. His personal physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos, reportedly supplied pills to Presley during his singing career 'without concern for his health,' which eventually led to his overdose-induced death. 1994: Kurt Cobain , former lead singer and guitarist of the band Nirvana, reportedly died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head that many reports link to a lethal dose of heroin. Like many of the others, Cobain had a history of illicit drug abuse, but upon his death, reports indicated that traces of diazepam, an anti-anxiety medication marketed under the name Valium, was also found in his blood. 1997: Famous comedian and actor Chris Farley was found dead in his apartment of an apparent drug overdose. But according to some reports, no illegal narcotics were found on the premesis, while plenty of prescription drugs were found. A later autopsy revealed morphine and cocaine intoxication as the cause of his 'accidental' death. 2007: Anna Nicole Smith , an American model, actress, and television personality died of an overdose of prescription drugs. There is still much controversy over her doctors' involvement in her death, as they reportedly wrote her fake prescriptions for sleeping pills, opioid painkillers, and anti-anxiety drugs, all of which contributed to her death. 2008: Actor Heath Ledger was killed by taking a cocktail of pharmaceuticals prescribed him by his doctors. These included OxyContin, Valium, Xanax, Restoril, Unisom, and Vicodin. 2009: American actress and artist Farrah Fawcett died as a result of prescribed chemotherapy treatments for her cancer. This treatment, which was prescribed for her anal cancer, actually caused more cancer, which ultimately destroyed her immune system and killed her. 2009: Michael Jackson , the 'King of Pop,' died, in part, because of an addiction to propofol, an intravenous anesthetic. He was also said to have an addiction to Demerol, a painkiller also linked to his death. Though prescription drugs eventually killed him, Jackson may have been deliberately drug induced by his 'handlers' for quite some time throughout his career as a way to maximize corporate profits. 2011: Singer Amy Winehouse reportedly died of alcohol poisoning, but some reports say that she may have also been taking prescription drugs. Though no 'illegal substances' were found in her body at the time of death, official reports appear to omit the actual cause of her death, which strongly points to prescription drugs as a culprit in addition to alcohol. 2012: Though the mainstream media is silent on the subject, some reports are now indicating that Whitney Houston's death was actually caused by prescription drugs and alcohol, not drowning. According to reports, a deadly combination of Lorazepam, Valium, Xanax, and sleeping medications killed Houston before she sunk underneath the water in her bathtub. This is not an exhaustive list of celebrity deaths, of course, and some of these cases are still disputed as to the actual causes of death. But one thing is for sure: FDA-approved prescription drugs, many of which are highly-addictive, are a primary cause of mortality in America today, and yet they continue to flood the market unabated.

0," There has been much outrage expressed in recent years over incidents of mass murder in the United States. In addition, politicians, foreign policy and national security experts have warned of the dangers of the ISIS terrorist movement, and have decried the group's murderous brutality directed at unarmed men, women and children. There has been far less handwringing over the lives lost to abortion, however, and that silence has been deafening especially since a series of videos in which Planned Parenthood officials haggle with actors posing as 'clients' over the sale of body parts from aborted babies. As reported by CNS News , according to the latest data from Planned Parenthood , published in its 2013-2014 report, shows that the organization performed a total of 327,653 abortions in a single year - or an average of 898 abortions per day . CNS News further breaks down the figure: From Oct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions. Over the course of those 365 days (or 8,760 hours), that averages out to 898 abortions per day and 37 abortions per hour. The difference in lives lost isn't even close While much of the liberal-dominant mainstream media has largely ignored the videos and the unlawful selling of body parts by Planned Parenthood beyond standard initial reporting, mass shootings almost always get much wider play. For weeks and even months after each incident, the mainstream media continues to 'advance' the storyline, or at least that what they call it; in reality, the MSM is simply echoing calls for more gun control. They 'advance' that singular narrative in part by interviewing additional pundits and politicians who are advocating against the Second Amendment. And yet, when comparing daily deaths from shootings versus lives lost each day in the country's Planned Parenthood abortion mills, the disparity is stark. According to the FBI's Crime in the United States - 2012 report , the latest available, there were a total of 8,855 gun-related homicides in the country. Handguns made up the bulk of those homicides (6,371); rifles - including the so-called 'assault rifles' that are regularly besmirched by the MSM and left-liberals - only accounted for 322, less than half of homicides committed by 'hands, fists, feet, etc.' (678). So, broken down, the number of gun-related homicides per day in 2012 came to around 24.3 per day - far fewer than the 898-per-day abortion total. If we break down the number of people killed in 'mass murders,' that figure is less than one per day. And, of course, the incidence of terrorism in the U.S. is even more rare. 'Shockingly unprofessional' That said, the dearth of reporting - not outrage, per se, but just reporting - of the Planned Parenthood scandal by the MSM is being noticed, and by some highly influential social commentators and analysts. In a wide-ranging interview with Salon , Camille Paglia criticized left-leaning mainstream media for all but ignoring the story. 'Now let me give you a recent example of the persisting insularity of liberal thought in the media. When the first secret Planned Parenthood video was released in mid-July, anyone who looks only at liberal media was kept totally in the dark about it, even after the second video was released,' she said. 'But the videos were being run nonstop all over conservative talk shows on radio and television. It was a huge and disturbing story, but there was total silence in the liberal media, ' she added. 'That kind of censorship was shockingly unprofessional. The liberal major media were trying to bury the story by ignoring it.' And this, from a former member of Planned Parenthood . Nevertheless, 'I was horrified and disgusted by those videos and immediately felt there were serious breaches of medical ethics in the conduct of Planned Parenthood officials,' she said. Some Americans obviously will disagree with Paglia, but what is not debatable is the glaring discrepancy between the number of lives lost daily to abortion versus those lost to a much more often maligned and talked about cause - gun-related homicide.

0," The health benefits of kale have been getting more and more attention as of late, especially due to the interest in kale chips as being a healthy snack. However, beyond just improving your general health, it can also improve your sex life, and it does so in a few different ways. Kale is a superfood that helps maintain healthy blood sugar levels, contributes energy and stimulates the brain by giving you a positive mood boost. It also keeps you feeling fuller longer due to the nutrient-dense nourishment it provides to your body and increases your sex drive by balancing hormone levels, which in turn gives you a great deal of energy. In just one cup of chopped, raw kale, you receive over 100% of the daily requirement for vitamins A, C and K. The key vitamins that make kale sexy The high vitamin A content in kale is essential for normal reproduction, and without it your body would decrease the production of sex hormones and cause your skin to get very dry and irritated. In addition, lack of vitamin A can cause both the testicles and ovaries to atrophy, which can cause sterilization. Therefore, having the vitamin A that kale offers can help keep you sexually healthy. The high vitamin C levels in kale help the body to absorb iron, form blood cells and assist the metabolism of the adrenal gland, all of which contributes to better sexual performance. In addition, the iron in kale provides oxygen-rich blood to carry the nutrients and hormones that you need to your sex organs for pleasure and endurance. Additional nutrients that make kale great for sex Kale is also high in chlorophyll, which is an alkaline-forming food, and that means that it helps increase flexibility, endurance and range of motion in addition to reducing inflammation (which can make you feel slow and bloated). Another vitamin in kale that helps with having good sex is vitamin B6, as it controls prolactin, which is a libido enhancer that increases sex-hormone production. As an added bonus, vitamin B6 in particular has also been shown to help decrease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) but has been shown to only be effective when consumed from natural foods rather than a supplement; thus, kale is a great nutritional resource for women who suffer from it. Kale also contains magnesium, which is important for the production of neurotransmitters and sex hormones that control the sex organs, and the potassium that kale contains also increases sex drive, making this vegetable a sexual powerhouse. Additional food for great sexual health There are a variety of nutritious foods that contribute to a great sex life.

Economic and nutritional degradation now sounds like most cities in America, even without a hurricane. The severe and epic disaster that happened in Hurricane Katrina is a dire warning and wake-up call. Filmmaker Robert Lee Grant who was living in New Orleans during Katrina had a simple thought in the aftermath: What can I do to help kids survive? 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina' is the story of organic gardening and permaculture applied directly to the place where kids are found even in the direst of times: the schoolyard. Every city faces the economic and nutrition crisis; 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina' should be as inspiring to every city as it has been to New Orleans. View the trailer here: http://premium.selfnews.tv/Nourishing_the_Kids.htm New Orleans was the canary in the mine, warning us about food self-sufficiency 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina' follows the story of how chef Alice Waters' 'edible schoolyard' program is contributing to the rebirth of the New Orleans uptown, poor, black Green Charter School after its devastation from Hurricane Katrina floodwaters. The film is powerful not because many of the kids in New Orleans are poor or black, and many of the people from Berkeley, sharing the way of the edible schoolyard, are rich and white. This film is powerful because our food and currency system can collapse, and there will be mass suffering and death if we cannot grow our own food locally. In 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina,' we learn how we can nourish all our kids. The film both reveals how the edible schoolyards are started and cultivated, and how much the edible schoolyard changes the lives of kids. You will see both sides in the preview at: http://premium.selfnews.tv/Nourishing_the_Kids.htm Why schools? You don't have to spend much time on selfnews to know that we find serious fault with the kind of education that turns kids into zombies that unconsciously go about their lives in the herd mentality. Many home-schools and alternative schools that keep kids connected to their originality, uniqueness, spark of divinity, and freedom of thought and expression cultivate gardens as a major part of their education. 'If they grow it, they will eat it' 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina' features Alice Waters (from Chez Panisse Restaurant), health professionals, educators, students. Alice Waters, who appears prominently in the film, advocates the connection between lifelong health and connection to the soils of the Earth from a young age. Waters finds support for her position in the eyes of the inspired filmmaker, Robert Lee Grant, who learned of her work when the communities of New Orleans were truly in need. Says Grant: 'All schools can do something along the lines of the edible schoolyard to get kids to put their hands in dirt, learning lifelong lessons about good nutrition, science, and citizenship.' Who's driving? 'Nourishing the Kids of Katrina' poses the question, 'Who will be the driving force for an edible schoolyard in your community?' It may be easier to establish organic, edible schoolyards in charter schools and alternative schools, but this film shows it is always possible with human drive. The film even lets you draw your own conclusions from comments by the President and First Lady of the United States about the development of the White House organic garden, issues of childhood obesity and health, and the importance of good nutrition. Ask yourself if you want to spearhead an edible schoolyard in your community, and consider Alice Waters' remark, 'The edible schoolyard is more than an upgrade of food in the cafeteria, much more than a garden program in a school.' Learn how and why edible schoolyards are here to heal, and here to stay: http://premium.selfnews.tv/Nourishing_the_Kids.htm "
0," Enzymes are extremely vital to human well-being. They play a critical role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, in immune response, cognitive acceleration and cellular detoxification, among other things. Get a wide variety of digestive enzymes to improve your digestive system. Enzymes are long-chain proteins that take on specific shapes and act like a key to unique locks throughout the body. Their job is to carry out very specific functions throughout the body. Most of the digestive enzymes are produced by the pancreas and are therefore called pancreatic enzymes. Enzymes and the digestive process: Enzymes are extremely important for breaking down carbohydrates, protein and fatty acids and preparing them for proper digestion and assimilation in the body. Individuals with digestive challenges are often unable to produce sufficient quantities of digestive enzymes and are unable to effectively digest the food that they are eating. Improper digestion causes significantly more stress and inflammation in the gut lining that ultimately leads to the degradation of the mucosal membranes and the complications of leaky gut syndrome. When the mucosal membrane is damaged, it is then unable to secrete the appropriate enzymes, and we end up with a vicious cycle that causes more gut inflammation. Symptoms of low pancreatic enzymes: "
0," Turmeric is one of nature's greatest gifts. Belonging to the ginger family, the ancient spice responsible for giving curry its yellow color is one of the most thoroughly researched plants in history. Experts suggest that turmeric may even have over 600 potential preventive and therapeutic applications and 175 distinct beneficial physiological effects. Native to India, where culture incorporates this spice into nearly every dish, turmeric is used for both food and medicine. Containing several powerful compounds, one of them being curcumin, turmeric has been used to treat diabetes, inflammation, depression and many other ailments. Studies have found that curcumin may help ward off heart attacks through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In animal research studies, scientists have also observed curcumin cells killing cancer cells, shrinking tumors and enhancing the effects of chemotherapy. Research has identified turmeric as being successful in treating some pretty serious medical conditions, many of which can be life-threatening. Below are four more reasons why you should use turmeric. Protects your brain Aromatic turmerone, another important compound found in the ancient spice, has been linked to good brain health. A study recently published in the journal Stem Cell Research and Therapy suggests that turmeric may help the brain repair itself following an injury and can be useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases, as reported by selfnews . That's some pretty powerful stuff. This means that stroke victims who frequently suffer long-term neurological damage could improve their brain health by using turmeric. Delays diabetes The results of a study conducted in 2012 showed that prediabetes patients prescribed curcumin supplements successfully delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes compared with prediabetic patients who took a placebo pill, according to Counsel & Heal. Alleviates joint pain Turmeric has been proven to replace a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, one of them being ibuprofen. Curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties work well against joint pain and are effective for treating arthritis. In 2012, a study using curcumin to treat joint pain and swelling found that it was more effective than diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Earlier studies suggest that turmeric may be useful for improving long-term pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Treats indigestion, ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome Research suggests that curcumin stimulates production of bile in the gall bladder, offering digestive aid and eliminating stomach discomfort, according to the University of Maryland. Turmeric may even be effective for treating heartburn, ulcers, Chrohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends turmeric for treating headaches, bronchitis, colds, lung infections, fibromyalgia, fever, menstrual problems, water retention and kidney problems. There are also reports of people applying the spice to their skin to eliminate pain, bruising, leech bites, eye infections, soreness in the mouth and infected wounds. One great aspect of using turmeric is that it can be easily incorporated into your diet. If your goal is to maintain good health, you can simply sprinkle it on many dishes like salads, soups, rice, eggs, veggies and tea. However, if you're trying to treat a more serious ailment and need high amounts of curcumin, taking a supplement is your best bet. Consuming curcumin supplements with black pepper containing piperine is helpful, as it aids in your body's absorption. Turmeric extract can replace dozens of Big Pharma-made drugs As reported earlier by selfnews , researchers with GreenMedInfo believe that turmeric could replace at least 14 pharmaceutical medications, including cholesterol drugs, steroids, antidepressants, blood thinners, anti-inflammatory meds and chemotherapy and diabetes drugs. Scientists observed curcumin to be 500 to 100,000 times more potent than metformin, a commonly prescribed diabetes drug.

0," Big Pharma has been doggedly searching for drugs that target a group of nuclear receptor proteins in the human body known by the long title of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, for short). The reason? PPARs regulate the expression of genes that are involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, among other functions -- so the theory is that if drugs could control PPARs, the medications would treat diabetes, high cholesterol and even maybe obesity. But it turns out there's already a substance that could do all this. And it's not a side effect-laden chemical. It's a compound in grapefruit. Bottom line: there's extremely sweet breaking news about a compound hidden in the tangy flavor of grapefruits that may treat diabetes naturally and also bring some of the benefits of low carb dieting to the body, too -- without dieting. Scientists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), have discovered that naringenin , an antioxidant derived from the bitter flavor of grapefruits and other citrus fruits, triggers the liver to break down fat. While the function of the pancreas is important to diabetics, the liver is the main organ responsible for the regulation of carbohydrates and blood levels of fat. After a meal, the blood is flushed with sugars, which activate LXR-alpha, a PPAR associated with inflammation. This triggers the liver to create fatty acids for long-term storage. But during periods of fasting (and low carb dieting) the process is reversed, fat cells release fatty acids and break them down to ketones. There's an increased sensitivity to insulin, too. The new research, just published in the online journal PLoS ONE , shows that naringenin activates two kinds of PPARs (dubbed PPAR-alpha and PPARy) and blocks LXR-alpha -- resulting in fasting-type benefits to the body. 'It is a process which is similar to the Atkins diet, without many of the side effects,' Martin L. Yarmush, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Center for Engineering in Medicine and one of the paper's authors, said in a media statement. 'The liver behaves as if fasting, breaking down fatty acids instead of carbohydrates.' 'It is a fascinating find,' Yaakov Nahmias, PhD, the paper's senior author said in the press statement. He pointed out that the results of the research were what the pharmaceutical industry has long been seeking through drug research. 'But their (drug) development was plagued by safety concerns. Remarkably, naringenin is a dietary supplement with a clear safety record. Evidence suggests it might actually protect the liver from damage,' Dr. Nahmias added. If the results of the new study hold up in human patients, the research team believes the grapefruit compound could become a treatment for high cholesterol, type-2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

0," Researchers from ATM Metabolics say they have isolated a chemical, naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables, that protects the body from the diabetes-producing effects of sugars. ATM Metabolics is a research company specializing in treatment of metabolic and neurological disorders. The researchers isolated and tested a chemical, which they call simulin, and found that it accelerated the removal of excess sugar from the bloodstream, increased the sensitivity of insulin receptors, reduced the amount of carbohydrates absorbed, and reduced the amount of glucose manufactured by the liver. It also helped '[mobilize] carbohydrates from the fat cells.' Calling simulin a 'sugar defense mechanism,' the researchers said their findings suggested the chemical helps the body deal with sugar's potentially harmful effects. If added to foods and beverages, they said, it might help protect against diabetes and even allow diabetics to eat sugary foods again. Simulin is not a sweetener, but rather a compound that could be added to already sweetened products. The researchers have speculated that the chemical evolved as a way to encourage animals to eat more fruit by protecting them against diabetes. 'Fruit plants depend on their fruits being eaten to spread, so it makes sense that they would do everything they could to keep their fruit on the menu,' said researcher Daryl Thompson. 'This could be why humans didn't become diabetic despite eating so much sugar in fruit and vegetables.' Thompson said that further studies of simulin's effects are underway to clear the way for its use as a commercial food additive. He said that because the product is natural, it should not need to receive special FDA approval, and could probably achieve Generally Recognized As Safe status. For the same reason, he expects companies and consumers to line up once the product is ready. 'We've had a good response from the food industry,' he said, 'and we think consumers will accept it because it is natural.' "
0," Soviet-style government food distribution is quickly becoming standard practice in the rapidly decaying United States of America, with more than 20 percent of Americans now participating in the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. And if the fast food industry gets its way, food stamps may soon cover buckets of fried chicken at KFC and Meximelts at Taco Bell. Food stamp benefits have more than doubled within the past six years, skyrocketing from $28.5 billion in 2005 to $64.7 billion in 2010. With this rise came the addition of 53,000 newly eligible businesses as well, which included convenience stores, dollar discount stores, and even gas stations. And now the fast food industry wants a piece of the pie, too. According to a recent report in USA Today , Louisville, Ky. based Yum! Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC, Long John Silver restaurant, and Pizza Hut, is lobbying the federal government to permit SNAP enrollees to use food stamps at their restaurants. And they claim doing so will help prevent hunger. But many in opposition are decrying the proposition as ridiculous, and a blatant misuse of public funds in support of junk foods rather than health foods. 'It's preposterous that a company like Yum! Brands would even be considered for inclusion in a program meant for supplemental nutrition,' said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. If the federal government ends up granting the fast food industry inclusion in the food stamps program, it will essentially be funneling taxpayer money into a system that promotes both abuse of the system and ill health. After all, fast food is laden with toxic chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and contains little to no nutritional value. And if participation in the food stamp program continues to rise -- which is expected, based on a continually plummeting economy -- the end result will essentially be a government-run system of food distribution in which most Americans have no choice but to eat the garbage peddled by their local fast food joints.

0," Political correctness. Allowable thought. Approved perspectives. Permitted speech. The political Left has a number of ways in which it seeks to control what Americans think and what they say, as well as how they perceive certain issues. Such techniques are anathema to our constitutional principles, especially the First Amendment's right of free speech and freedom of association. The agreement was supposed to be something like, 'We all don't have to agree on everything, but we all have the right to say what we think.' Not anymore. Increasingly, when Americans venture outside the lines of what the Left considers 'approved' behavior, they are punished with attempts to marginalize them, assassinate their character, impugn and smear their reputations, and -- a favorite of liberal media -- grossly misrepresent what they say, think and believe. All of these measures were employed recently against former U.S. Rep. Dr. Ron Paul, a Texas Republican long known to promote and support an originalist view of the Constitution -- this time by a writer from The Washington Post . Topic of secession considered too taboo to broach As noted by Thomas E. Woods recently on his talk radio program, The Tom Woods Show , Episode 326, the writer did a hit piece on Paul following a public event in Houston, in which Paul appeared and where some politically incorrect topics such as secession were discussed. The event, the 'Mises Circle Event on Secession,' was hosted by the Mises Institute , an organization and think tank promoting the economic liberty principles of Austrian scholar Ludwig von Mises. The event was focused on revisiting the principle of states breaking away from others in the face of rising tyranny and loss of liberty: The growing number of secession movements around the world gives rise to our topic: breaking away from current government structures that do so much harm to liberty, peace, and prosperity. We will examine the philosophical and historical underpinnings of secession, the benefits of radical decentralization, and how disengagement from tyrannical states may be the last, best hope for the endangered classical liberal tradition. The Post reporter, Woods said on his program, 'we all knew was there to do a story smearing Ron, and smearing all of us because, as you know, the idea of secession is not on the 3 x 5 card of allowable opinion.' Woods went on to play a clip of his speech at the event, stating that he fashioned his remarks 'fully aware' that the Post reporter (David A. Fahrenthold) was in the audience listening to every word. 'My entire talk was a response to the mentality of the mainstream media,' he told his radio audience. ' Not on the 3 x 5 card' Woods said when the Post piece was published, others who spoke at the event were mentioned by name in the report -- but not him . A selfnews review of the Post article posted online found no reference to Woods, as he stated. Here is a short compilation of what Woods said during his Houston speech: -- One of my themes over the years has been that the American media and political classes behave as if there is a 3 x 5 card of allowable opinion, and if you stray from that 3 x 5 card, you will be smeared, condemned, written out of polite society... [ but ] you won't be refuted. -- You can make all the reasonable arguments you want, but if you're taking a position that is held by neither Mitt Romney nor Hillary Clinton, you are wrong by definition. So there is no need to refute you. -- Secession is nowhere to be found on that 3 x 5 card. ... You can favor 38 percent top income tax rate, or 37 percent, that's on the card. You can favor the federal courts telling you to do this or do that. ... But secession is like, I don't know, it's in some other galaxy that hasn't been discovered.

0," Tweet The following is part three of an interview between Mike Adams and Dr. Hank Liers, the chief formulator of products sold by Health Products Distributors, Inc. (HPDI) ( www.IntegratedHealth.com ). To see all parts of this interview, search this site for 'Dr. Hank Liers.' Mike: When you say 'chemically sensitive,' what reactions do people show to other more mainstream supplements that use low-quality ingredients or excipients? Dr. Liers: They may just get sick from them. They may lose the ability to think clearly. They may have pain all over their body. There may be gastrointestinal effects. Many chemically sensitive people cannot take any supplements. For my wife, I actually designed a formula called Myo-Mag, which is mainly magnesium malate, but it has the coenzyme B vitamins, and if you look at the Kreb's cycle, she had a functional magnesium deficiency. She was not using magnesium -- even though she had plenty in her blood. Well, magnesium malate has this beautiful property; the malic acid actually kicks the Kreb's cycle into gear. Once you have the Kreb's cycle kicked into gear, then you need the magnesium to make the ATP or to use the ATP. Magnesium malate is wonderful. If you do not have B vitamins, you cannot even kick the Kreb's cycle into gear. I put coenzyme B vitamins in Myo-Mag and I buffered it. A lot of people who are chemically sensitive, if their body gets acidic they cannot function. They will use baking soda to neutralize themselves. My wife was highly chemically sensitive for 10 years. When I designed Myo-Mag for her, she could not take any vitamin, or just maybe a couple of things that were very simple. Afterwards, she could take any vitamin. She had ATP! The world is not going to get any better by sitting back or waiting for improvement. We are pushing the envelope, and if you can get enough of it out there, it starts filtering down, especially after you see what it does for you. How to use Rejuvenate superfood Mike: For those reading who may be interested in trying Rejuvenate! But you are not sure how you will deal with the green color, I just wanted to mention it really is all in your head. At least what I have found useful when I first started getting into these drinks is just use a tiny bit at first. Make it a very slight green, almost like a mint ice cream green, and then you can work your way into it over time. Over time you will associate green with health. Dr. Liers: We have people who just start by adding a little Rejuvenate! To fruit or berry smoothies, because they like the smell and the color. But once they start feeling good, we feel in the long run they will transition to more of the green stuff. That's what we are seeing. Even with me -- I wanted more fruit in the beginning -- and now it's greens, greens, greens. Getting rid of synthetic chemicals in your body Mike: More and more consumers are now acutely aware of the chemical burden that is being placed on our bodies. Even mainstream journalists are aware. I think it was National Geographic that had a journalist who went and had all the testing done and found out that he had hundreds of synthetic chemicals in his organs. Dr. Gabriel Cousins down in southern Arizona is doing a lot of testing on this right now, and is finding hundreds of chemicals in the heart, the liver, the brain and the kidneys. They are embedded in all the tissues. Chlorella is really, at least in my opinion, one of the most potent detoxification nutrients available in the world. Can you talk about your knowledge of chlorella in that context? Dr. Liers: I agree with you, and I think detox can come about in a number of ways. Chlorophyll could be a detoxifier that will pull things out that might kill viruses that sequester the heavy metals, for example. I think the cell wall of chlorella is generally considered the thing that just grabs on to almost any toxin in the body , whether it is heavy metals, pesticides, organic chemicals, and they have done tremendous experiments with that in Japan. I think there are more research papers on chlorella than any substance known. They are mostly in other languages. I have seen an explosion just since we have come up with this. They were selling chlorella in these little tablets, and for years and years in little granules. Then the capsules came out. These products were good, but people were not getting the amounts they needed. To get that detoxification effect you need to have enough of it. I decided I was going to get some powder. Then everyone was worried about dealing with powder, and it is kind of messy. It is green and I love it. If I have a green mustache it's all right with me. Mike: Better that than a milk mustache. Dr. Liers: That is right, much better. We started taking huge amounts, and I think we all experienced detoxification. My wife got very itchy in her skin, and she had worked in pathology labs and pipetted radioactive materials, and maybe that is a reason she was chemically sensitive. Chlorella makes her feel wonderful, but you can see the skin breaks out for some period and a lot of people say, 'Oh I am breaking out.' Well, in Japan they tell people to expect this, and it is not going to be when you first take it, probably because it has a building effect. As you build maybe two or three months into it, suddenly you will break out in a rash. Then you just work your way through that, and on the other end it is like whatever it was that was causing it is now out of your body. Mike: Well, so often a body is using its own innate processes to move toxins out to cleanse itself and the skin, of course, is the largest organ, and the skin is where many toxins escape. Yet, again, in Western Society there is so much attention paid to blocking all of these expressions. I mean people put on antiperspirants to block perspiration, which is a very important cleansing function. I think there is a mindset shift that is important for people to understand: just because you have a rash on your skin does not mean that something is wrong. It could be that something is trying to express itself and move out. Dr. Liers: This is so true. Back to this chemical sensitivity issue, we have had to learn to live in a very clean environment. We have all-tile floors. We clean the house with baking soda and vinegar. We keep plastics minimized in the house. We keep molds down. You do everything you possibly can externally, but even you do not use shampoos. You do not use soaps. Then you find out you do not need them. Actually the more you eat good, organic whole food and stay away from these chemicals, the better you smell, to the point that now, walking up to someone with a bunch of perfume on is a bad experience. Mike: I have to speak to that, too. You know that aisle in every grocery store that has all the detergent in it? I cannot even go near it. I have actually written about body odor a lot, and when people who eat the milk, the yogurt and the butter and the animal fat, they really begin to take on the smell of those substances throughout. Chlorella is something that can really help cleanse that smell. Dr. Liers: Interestingly enough, you cannot only do chlorella internally, chlorella externally is phenomenal. Because of all the growth factors in it, you can put it on a wound and it will just heal so fast you cannot believe it. I am a big one for using herbal poultices for spider bites and anything that gets into your skin. You have to get it out. We use charcoal and bentonite clay and slippery elm bark, and recently we have added chlorella into that poultice basic formula. Of course the chlorella with the cell wall is going to pull heavy metals and toxins out. With those growth factors that are in there, you are going to stimulate the regeneration and healing in the local area. It is a little bit expensive now. We use the poultices on bruises, injuries, bites, and with the chlorella added it makes a huge difference. Dr. Bernard Jensen was doing this in the early 1990s. He found that it was a wonderful thing to do. It is food therapy in more ways than you thought. Multi-generational chemical toxicities Mike: Let me ask you a deeper question with the detoxification of chemicals and the role that micronutrients and micro-algae nutrients, like chlorella and CGF, can play in that; there is an increasing awareness now that the chemical burden on our population is multi-generational. The epigenetic factors are starting to be recognized, and we are realizing that the toxic load of someone today is passed on through multiple generations. Their children really do not start with a clean slate -- they start with the burden that was inherited through factors other than straight genetics. Do you want to speak to this? What can chlorella do for it? Dr. Liers: The first thing that hits my mind is that chlorella is a 2-billion-year-old organism or older. That means it has survived every catastrophe on earth through all the generations. It is a tremendous survivor. How do you become a tremendous survivor? Obviously, you have to be able to repair your genetics. The growth factors come into play there. There are organisms out there -- little bacteria that you can hit with radiation that would kill anybody else -- and they will so quickly repair their genes. You have to have the nutrients in your body -- those growth factors -- to do that regeneration. As you know, chlorella can quadruple itself in 20 hours. I do not know anything else that can do that. That is indicative of the growth factors. In Japan, when they gave them to children and young animals, they grew like crazy. Not abnormally, but they just grew rapidly. In Dr. Jensen's book about chlorella you can see rabbits, chickens, and birds, and when they gave them those growth factors, those animals at the same age as the placebos were twice as big. That is quite an amazing story. The growth factor is a major factor. People are coming to understand this now. When you talked a little bit about homeopathic factors, there may be things we do not quite understand yet about all of this. We use the term 'growth factor' but we are not sure exactly how that is working and what it means. One of the most interesting findings in research with autistic children is the role of mercury. Many experts clearly feel that mercury is a major problem in autism. You cannot get the mercury out with anything that is known. You try to and do DMSA and whatever, and they cannot get it out. They have found that viruses sequestered the heavy metals, and that the viruses were hard to get out of the body. Well, it turns out that RNA is a tremendous anti-viral substance. Dr. Gary Gordon was giving these RNA factors to autistic children and knocking out the viruses and then getting the mercury detox. It is a more complex story. It is not like just going in and grabbing something, because somebody is on the other side saying, 'No, I want it, and I am staying here.' How do you get them out? It is a bigger picture. You have to be in the position not only to chelate mercury, if you could, but to knock out the viruses that are grabbing onto it even stronger than the chelation therapy. Mike: That is interesting. How does a virus sequester heavy metals? Dr. Liers: You will see this in the research literature more now. The therapies are aimed at knocking out the viruses, and maybe using these growth factors to make the cellular functioning better, maybe changing the cell potential, because cell potentials -- when they start coming down -- make the cell not able to function at the level it is supposed to. You are not getting things in and out right. You are not getting the Kreb's cycle right. Who knows, maybe the receptors are not even taking in T3 (thyroid hormone) and stimulating the growth of the cell? Glutathione is a phenomenal material, but when you are so toxic and have so many free radicals you can easily deplete glutathione. They are using injectables, for example, and getting extremely good results through replenishing glutathione.

0," For at least the past 15 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been actively trying to develop new ways to decrease fraud in the federal food stamp program, which currently covers nearly 50 million Americans and adds more than 10,000 new enrollees to its ranks every single day, according to reports. But one disconcerting method the agency appears to be considering involves the potential use of radio frequency identification (RFID) chips to track and identify food stamp recipients at the national level. Two separate reports quietly issued by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service program back in 1999 reveal that the agency's ultimate goal is to develop new tracking protocols that will supposedly improve the integrity of the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP). In both of these reports, the USDA explains how novel biometric identification technologies can help better verify the identities of food stamp recipients, and thus decrease fraud and 'double-dipping.' 'Biometric identification technology provides automated methods to identify a person based on physical characteristics -- such as fingerprints, hand shape, and characteristics of the eyes and face -- as well as behavioral characteristics -- including signatures and voice patterns,' reads the executive summary of one of the reports, entitled Introduction to Biometric Identification Technology: Capabilities and Applications to the Food Stamp Program . Select states including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey already employ biometric technologies like fingerprint identification, facial recognition, and even retina scans on the local and regional level, apart from a federal government mandate. But as pointed out by Brandon Turbeville over at Activist Post , this emerging roll-out of new biometric ID programs across the nation has been intentionally gradual so as not to raise too much negative attention about this encroaching violation of individual liberty and personal privacy. Government pushing RFID as solution to fraud, waste How does this all tie in with potential RFID chips? Part of this biometric paradigm that the USDA has embraced includes the use of RFID chips, which are already being embedded into credit cards and various other payment devices. Such technology is claimed to help reduce credit card fraud, which means it may be the logical next step for EBT, WIC, and other social welfare problems that are said to be heavily abused by criminals. This type of system is already in place throughout India, after all, where biometric ID cards were recently issued to all of the country's 1.2 billion residents -- and America appears to be next. 'Like the Indian UID program, the roll-out of the American system will require fingerprinting of individuals receiving food stamps under the guise of reducing fraud,' writes Turbeville. '[L]ike the early status of the Japanese version of the UID, the Juki-Net, the emerging American system is currently being implemented on a state-wide or local basis (county or city), with no administration by the [federal government].'

0," A small deciduous tree or large shrub that bears fruit, the Punica granatum , commonly known as the pomegranate, is a superfood with a long and rich history. Native to the East, it can be traced through historical documents as far back as 4000 B.C. The red fruit grows from pretty red flowers and is between a lemon and a grapefruit in size. The white flesh inside the thick skin is full of several hundred seeds. Pomegranates are grown as both a fruit crop and as ornamental trees or shrubs for parks and gardens. They are tolerant of drought and moderate frost, growing in climates similar to the Mediterranean region, California, or Northern India. There are many genotypes, with the differences ranging from exocarp and aril color, hardness of seed, fruit size, juice content and astringency, and so on. The pomegranate has become increasingly popular in the countries of North America over the last few decades. The pomegranate is one of the world's most ancient foods The name pomegranate comes from Medieval Latin meaning 'seeded apple.' It has been named in many ancient texts from the Book of Exodus in the Torah, the Quran, the Homeric Hymns, and Mesopotamian records, to name a few. The pomegranate originally came from Persia, or modern day Iran, and the western Himalayas. It has been cultivated for millennia in places such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Russia, and the Mediterranean region ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ). It migrated as far east as China and Southeast Asia and was found along the Silk Road as a symbol of abundance and posterity. It is also grown extensively in Korea, Japan, and Latin America, having been introduced there by settlers or traders. Archaeologists have found carbonized pomegranate exocarps in places such as Jericho from the Early Bronze Age (3000 BC), Cyprus, from the Late Bronze Age, and in Egyptian tombs, including King Tut's. Pomegranates were highly valued in Ancient Egypt, and were part of the supply of fruits required in a pharaoh's residence (1600 BC). It was revered enough to have been painted on walls and tombs to symbolize life after death. The pomegranate had many uses, including the fruit as food, the juice as a tonic to kill parasites, the blossom was crushed to make a red dye, and the peel was used to dye leather. ( http://www.pomwonderful.com ) Other ancient sightings of the pomegranate include on the pillars of the Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, on the robes of Jewish priests, and in mosaics from ancient Rome (including Pompeii) where it was called the 'Phoenician apple.' Its twigs were worn on Roman women's headdresses to signify marital status. In Zoroastrian temples, pomegranates were used to symbolize eternal life and were associated with fertility. A symbol of strength in ancient Persia, the army of Xerxes carried spears with pomegranates on the tip (instead of spikes) when they invaded Greece in 480 BC. ( http://www.foodreference.com/html/a-pomegranate-history.html ). Pomegranates were also depicted on the walls of the royal palace and fortress Alhambra of the Islamic Nasrid Dynasty by the Moors in Spain. They even renamed one of their cities after the fruit. It also has a place of significance in Armenian culture. More than just a nutritious food source, the pomegranate was an integral part of many cultures. In many cases, the pomegranate surpassed its status as a highly celebrated source of food, and became part of the lore and legends of a culture. It was celebrated by the Buddha, and was considered one of the three blessed fruits, often being represented in Buddhist art. It was also depicted on the Temple of the Founder of Zen, to honor Bodhidharma. Another example is how prominently the pomegranate was featured in Greek myths (approximately 500 BC). Most of us remember how Hades tempted Persephone with a pomegranate, and when she partook, it bound her to him as pomegranates symbolize the indissolubility of marriage. This is how Greek legend explains the seasons: when Persephone is in the Underworld with her husband, it is winter; when she rejoins her mother every year, we have spring. Pomegranates have been a central part of many religions. Over the centuries, pomegranates were featured on Jewish money, furnishings, and religious objects. Around 600 AD Islam's Muhammad had high regard for the pomegranate, considering it to be nutritious for both physical and emotional health. Legend has it that each pomegranate contains one aril descended directly from paradise ( http://www.foodreference.com/html/a-pomegranate-history.html ). By 1500 AD, the pomegranate had also become an important symbol in Christianity, representing Jesus' resurrection. It was also used to symbolize The Virgin Mary because 'both are filled with sweetness,' and like a pomegranate she is said 'to have within her many benefits for humankind, all revealed in Christ.' (EDITOR'S NOTE: NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS PART ABOUT JESUS AND MARY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?) In India, the pomegranate has been a Hindu symbol of prosperity and fertility for centuries and is thought to bring good health. The pomegranate is featured prominently in Hindu art, being found on several avatars of Ganesha. ( http://www.pomwonderful.com/about/pomegranate-history-legend/asia/ ) As the pomegranate made its way to Europe, it had become more of a symbol than a food, and was portrayed regularly in art, literature, religion, and mythology. Eventually the western cultures come to value the pomegranate for its medicinal properties, and it was featured in heraldry, being found on the heraldic crests of many medical institutions including the British Medical Association ( http://www.pomwonderful.com/about/pomegranate-history-legend/europe/ ). As it spread throughout Europe, the pomegranate came to appear on several coats of arms and symbolize noble birth. The pomegranate made it to the new world via Spanish missionaries. When Cortez conquered the Aztecs in the 1500s, pomegranate trees were planted in Mexico, then made their way north to missions in California and Texas. It spread across the south but did not do well in the northern climates. In 1771, Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello, his plantation in Virginia. Around the year 2000, pomegranate popularity began to grow again as this sweet, juicy, succulent fruit was rediscovered. It's availability around the United States increased as a result.

Pomegranates are one of the most popular superfoods readily available today The pomegranate became popular in the Middle Eastern civilizations 6000 years ago largely because its dense nutrition and juice provided sustenance for long journeys. The superfood status of the pomegranate has only grown in modern times as nutritional research has come to decipher and understand the true power of the pomegranate's phytonutrients. India's Ayurvedic medicine has used pomegranates as a source for traditional remedies for thousands of years. For example, the bark of the tree and the fruit rind is used to stem diarrhea, dysentery, bladder problems, mouth ulcers, and intestinal parasites while the seeds and juice are considered a tonic for the heart. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ) The seeds in their casings, or arils, are the most desired part of the pomegranate, and they are consumed raw. Pomegranate juice can be sweet or sour depending on the variety, but most are moderate with some astringent notes due to the acidic tannins. Pomegranates are rich in vitamin C, pantothenic acid, potassium, flavonoids, and other natural phenols such as ellagitannins, a powerful antioxidant. The pomegranate also has unsaturated oils, fiber, and many additional micronutrients, if you eat the seeds. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ) Some miscellaneous uses of pomegranates many may not know include that it is often used as a bonsai tree and that pomegranate juice is sweetened and thickened to make grenadine syrup for cocktails. Throughout most of recorded history, our ancestors have had high regard for the pomegranate. Its immune boosting phytonutrients have shown to be an effective tool in preventing degenerative and inflammatory ailments such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis ( http://www.selfnews.com/031068_pomegranate_superfood.html ). Current research underway includes studies on how pomegranate components affect diseases such as diabetes, cancer, rhinovirus, the common cold, coronary artery disease, kidney disease, and brain injury.

0," The mainstream, legacy media is continuing to struggle for attention as more and more Americans abandon their propaganda for the truth and salvation of independent and alternative media information sites. Agence France-Presse reports that the value of Old Media has dropped significantly in recent years, especially the traditional newspaper industry, as it has struggled to cope with the rising New Media landscape. This was epitomized recently by the sale of the San Diego Union-Tribune in early May for $85 million, AFP said, which 'underscored the horrific slump in the value of 'old media' companies' in the past several years. AFP further reported: Although the sum paid by Tribune Publishing was only marginally below the $110 million in a 2011 sale of the San Diego group and excluded some valuable real estate, the newspaper was believed to be worth as much as $1 billion as late as 2004. Revenues decline as investment dollars in digital platforms remain scarce This story is being repeated at major metro dailies all over the country. In fact, the Pew Research Center says that valuations of the Boston Globe , Philadelphia Inquirer , Minneapolis Star-Tribune , and Chicago Sun-Times are all down by more than 90 percent of their peaks. While these and other legacy papers are attempting to retain readership by offering digital subscriptions and mobile apps, such efforts appear to be too little, too late for many. For U.S. dailies over the past 10 years, weekday circulation has dropped off 17 percent. In addition, ad revenue has fallen by more than 50 percent as advertisers turn to online dailies and other media, Pew noted. The financial hemorrhaging got so bad last year for three large media companies that they opted to spin off newspapers so they could concentrate more on profitable enterprises like broadcast or digital properties. 'Every newspaper chain talks about getting digital faster. The plain truth is that despite almost two decades of effort, most aren't close to where they need to be,' Ken Doctor, an industry analyst who is the author of the Newsonomics blog and consultant for the research firm Outsell, told AFP. In short order, Doctor predicts, newspapers won't be left with many options except to cut the frequency of their print editions, as several dailies have already done. Alternatively, they might opt to go completely digital, as some have chosen to do. That latter option is easier said than done, however. Developing a user-friendly digital platform that retains some of the print version's identity is expensive, and since ad revenues for the industry have not increased since 2008, it is more difficult to invest in digital because the funds are simply not there. During the first quarter of this year, seven of the biggest newspaper groups only generated a combined profit of $21 million. In 2005, the massive Gannett group alone earned $1.8 billion. 'These companies have little to invest,' Doctor said. 'They're still paying off debt, issuing dividends, keeping up with pension obligations, and anticipating print ad results that can't find a bottom.' The red ink will continue to flow Even the legacy starship paper The New York Times , which as been one of the most aggressive in shifting to digital news, acknowledged recently that 70 percent of its income is derived from the print editions. What is the solution? Alan Mutter, a former Chicago newspaper editor who now consults on digital news, told AFP that newspaper groups should rethink their strategy and act more like startups. 'People in the media business have to recognize they're not in the print or broadcasting business, they are in the business of attracting audiences' to sell advertising, he said. Other papers are beginning to partner with huge digital brands such as Facebook, Google and other media companies that have a global reach. In the meantime, the legacy papers will continue to be printed in black ink, but it's the red ink that will ultimately spell the demise of many of them.

0," In America, where freedom of speech is supposed to reign supreme, there is still censorship, even at our country's mature age. And what's more, the problem is getting worse. In recent months, for example, YouTube and Google put an age restriction to access to a satirical video about the Transportation Security Administration , produced by our founder and editor, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger. The video, entitled, TSA: Help Wanted , highlighted the agency's crass and absurd policies and procedures, as well a growing number of officers hired by the agency as screeners (many have criminal records and many more have been arrested for a host of crimes, ranging from theft to child pornography). But apparently it's okay with YouTube to allow hackers to promote their services, uninhibited and without restriction, even though the very act of hacking is malicious in nature and often involves theft of private information. No worries about being pulled or restricted In one video, a seller who goes by the name Gwapo is especially open about his/her business . The video, which is narrated by an American male, promotes a website called DDoS Service (DDoS is short for 'Distributed Denial of Service'), is also apparently accessible by everyone - no limitations, no restrictions. In the one minute, 48 second video , the man hawks the hacker's wares: So you're here for one reason...If that reason is because you need your business competitors, rivals, haters...or whatever the reason is, or who, they are to go down! Well you, my friend, you came to the right place. If you want your business competitors to go down, well, they can. If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will. Not only that, we're providing a short-term to long-term DDoS service or scheduled attack. Starting at five dollars per hour for small personal websites, to 10 to 50 per hour for huge, DDoS-protected websites. Prices may depend on how huge the website is, or how protected it is. The announcer goes onto say the hacker service has four years of 'DDoS-ing experience,' as well as 'several years of studying on DDoS protection,' and that it is 'capable of handling the sites for days, weeks, months...' He then provides several email addresses in which interested parties can contact the service, and adds that the service only accepts 'secure' forms of payment, for mutual security. 'It is a remarkably brazen piece of marketing. Perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that YouTube allows such videos to be published. Since being thrown on the site in mid-June, it has already acquired over 32,000 views,' says TechWeekEurope , a British-based technology website. Unabashed, uninhibited - and unrestricted - marketing It's not the first video produced and posted on YouTube to create business for the hacker firm. In the second video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCacibJa0Ps&feature;=youtu.be Hello, hackers. I'm promoting Gwapo's Professional DDoS Service. We are here to provide you a cheap, professional DDoS service. We have been running this service on hack forums for months. And, serving a few huge companies outside hack forums. The remainder of the one-minute, 10-second video essentially provides the same information as the first video, but it's the presentation - and the fact that such services can be posted and promoted without restriction, while other content, such as a satirical TSA video, is not worthy of the same free speech protections. 'DDoSers are unafraid of outlandish promotion. They know there is money to be earned here, and they know there is plenty of competition,' said the British tech website. Why would they be? They don't have to worry about YouTube's restrictions.

0," Brazil's Zika outbreak may be far worse than had previously been believed, the country's top health official claimed on February 1, because the vast majority of infected people do not show any symptoms. Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that has recently begun spreading through Latin America for the first time. Some researchers claim that it may be linked to thousands of new cases of a congenital condition called microcephaly in Brazil, although very few microcephaly cases have actually shown any trace of the virus. Concern over the possibility that Zika infection of pregnant women may be causing microcephaly has caused the World Health Organization to declare the Latin American Zika outbreak a global emergency. Microcephaly is characterized by an abnormally small head and, often, underdeveloped brains. In 90 percent of cases, microcephaly results in hampered physical and mental development. Scale of outbreak unknown The Zika virus was first identified in Africa in 1947, but was utterly unknown in the Americas until it struck Brazil in May 2015. The Brazilian government believes that it probably reached the continent when an infected visitor came to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. That person was bitten by a mosquito, which then contracted and began spreading the virus. Once enough people were infected, the larger mosquito population also became infected, which is probably enough to allow the virus to become endemic. According to the Pan-American Health Organization, Zika has already spread from Brazil to 24 other countries and territories in the Western Hemisphere, including Colombia, where there have been over 3,100 cases of pregnant women with Zika virus without a single confirmed case of microcephaly. Evidence now suggests that the spread of the virus may have been accelerated by the irresponsible release of genetically modified mosquitoes, which ended up boosting rather than depleting the population of the animals that carry the virus. Since the outbreak started, Brazil has seen a total of 3,700 suspected and has confirmed new microcephaly cases in a trend that actually predates the virus 'epidemic.' According to Health Minister Marcelo Castro, Brazilian medical experts are claiming that microcephaly is being caused by the Zika virus infecting pregnant mothers; Castro has also contradicted health experts' claims that the virus can be transmitted from person to person, through bodily fluids such as semen. 'The microcephaly cases are increasing by the week and we do not have an estimate of how many there will be,' Castro said. 'The situation is serious and worrying.' The fact that so many cases are asymptomatic makes it harder to get a grasp on just how bad the outbreak is, he warned. 'Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,' Castro said. 'A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious [than] we can imagine.' Brazil mobilizes military, vaccine makers Brazil is resorting to extreme measures in an effort to get a handle on the virus. Local governments are now required to report all Zika cases to the central government, and nearly all states now have labs equipped to test for the virus. By March, the government expects those labs to also be able to test for dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same mosquito. These tests will only be effective within five days of infection, however. In addition, President Dilma Rousseff has signed a temporary decree requiring all Brazilian residents to allow government officials to inspect their properties and homes to make sure they have no sources of standing water that could allow mosquitoes to breed. The government will be sending tens of thousands of soldiers door-to-door as part of this effort. Brazil has also announced plans to prohibit people who have ever had Zika from donating blood. Researchers from Brazil have also partnered with U.S. scientists in a fast-tracked effort to develop a Zika vaccine. The scientists are planning to genetically modify the virus used in a (still experimental) dengue vaccine. In spite of all its alarmist language about the outbreak, the Brazilian government insists that there is no reason to cancel or relocate the 2016 Olympic Games, planned for Rio de Janeiro in August. 'We have to explain to those coming to Brazil, the athletes, that there is zero risk if you are not a pregnant woman,' said Jaques Wagner, the president's chief of staff. While many in the media and biotech or pharmaceutical industries continue to link Zika virus to microcephaly without any evidence, other health experts have chosen to examine alternative causes behind rising number of birth defects in the region. One of the most likely culprits is pyriproxyfen, a growth-inhibiting larvacide produced by a Monsanto subsidiary which the Brazilian government has been adding to water supplies in impoverished areas for the last one and a half years.

0," Tweet Is cosmetic surgery important for saving your job? I'm seeing an increasing number of stories on cosmetic surgery for men, and in asking men why they want to get cosmetic surgery, the most common answer I've heard is: they want to save their jobs. This is the answer from men who are middle aged and want to appear younger in order to have better career opportunities. I find this fascinating. First, there is apparently a lot of age discrimination going on in the workplace. So, in addition to the racial discrimination and gender discrimination, we also have a fair amount of age discrimination going on. The older you are, the more likely you are to be let go, it seems. So a lot of men think if they simply appear younger, with black hair, younger-looking skin, a facelift and a nose job, they can stay in their current job or have better job prospects. Sadly, they may, in fact, be right, because many employers do tend to judge people on their appearance, even if it's not conscious. Sometimes the perception of a person's ability goes along with their hair color, apparent youth or apparent level of fitness, even if those don't correlate with their actual job performance. I would like to suggest there's a better way to appear younger than turning to cosmetic surgery, liposuction or some other radical procedure, and that is to make yourself mentally sharper. Because, if you really want to save your job, the best way to do it, I think, is to enhance your mental performance -- have a sharper memory, have an improved vocabulary, be more creative and have stronger analytical skills. The way to do that is through lifestyle changes: namely, nutrition and brain exercises. On the nutritional front, there are a great many things you can do to enhance brain function. First, there is a whole class of foods and food ingredients you have to avoid to protect your nervous system (ingredients that I call 'metabolic disruptors'), and then there is a whole other group of nutritional supplements and herbal supplements that can enhance brain function. Let's go through these quickly. On the things to avoid list, you certainly want to avoid hydrogenated oils. Those are described as brain poison, and they're terrible for the nervous system. You also want to avoid most prescription drugs, and I don't mean just stopping them cold turkey, but finding ways to get off of them in a healthy manner with the guidance of a qualified health professional. A lot of drugs, most notably statin drugs, greatly interfere with brain function. If you're on statin drugs, and you can't figure out why your memory is fading and why you seem to be unable to concentrate the way you used to be able to, the reason is probably because of the drugs you're on. So you want to get off of those drugs and return to normal, healthy brain function. Other food ingredients that affect brain function include artificial colors. These have been known to cause attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They can alter moods, greatly impair cognitive function and should be avoided by anyone wanting to have a good, healthy brain. Lastly, you should avoid refined carbohydrates and added sugars. These are also a form of brain poison, because they alter the availability of blood sugar in your bloodstream, and your brain operates on blood sugar. So, when you have wild swings in your blood sugar, your brain function rises and falls like the tide, and it can suffer greatly because of it. Relatively low blood sugar, for example, can cause forgetfulness, moodiness, aggression and a lot of other problems that will make it difficult for you to keep your job no matter what you look like. By the way, I cover more of these in a lot greater detail in the book Grocery Warning, which you will find at www.TruthPublishing.com. This goes into great detail about the ingredients you need to avoid to be healthy, not only in terms of brain health, but also cardiovascular health, immune system function and so on. Now, let's look at the things you can do to enhance your brain health. First, of course, there's physical exercise. With physical exercise there's a lot of oxygen that gets moved around your body, and your brain needs oxygen to function well. Without adequate oxygen, you're not going to have good brain function no matter what your nutrition. So, get some regular physical exercise, you will improve the oxygen-carrying ability of your red blood cells, and thereby improve your brain function at the same time. As far as supplements go, you need to get some healthy oils, because nervous system function depends heavily on the presence of these healthy oils in your body. These include the omega-3 fatty acids and various subcomponents of that, most notably GLA or gamma linolenic acid. GLA, which is present in human breast milk, is critical for not only the development of brain tissue but the ongoing support of it. You can get GLA in superfoods like spirulina. You can also find GLA in various fish oils, such as cod liver oil, which is another fantastic supplement to be taking on a regular basis. Also, you can get it from a variety of foods, most notably oily fish and many different nuts and seeds. So this, again, is another reason to be consuming raw nuts on a regular basis. In that category, my top choice is raw macadamia nuts. On the herbal front, there is of course ginkgo, and ginkgo does, in fact, improve brain function. However, it shouldn't be relied on as the only way to boost brain function. There are far greater benefits from physical exercise and breathing therapy and other nutritional supplements. Ginkgo's great, but don't use it alone, use it in conjunction with other nutritional elements to boost your brain function. Now, let's move on to perhaps the most important thing you can do to boost brain function and appear younger: engage in brain exercise and avoid those activities that dumb you down. So, right off the bat here we've got to mention television. If you spend a lot of time watching television, you are dumbing down your brain. There's no question about it. The more TV you watch, the older you get in terms of brain function. You can bet an employer won't like you hanging around if you can't remember what jobs you're supposed to do, even if you do have black hair and great-looking skin. To boost brain function, you've got to engage in brain exercises. There are lots of ways to get good brain exercise, but the bottom line is you have to use it or you're going to lose it. For brain exercise, you can work on crossword puzzles, play strategy games on the PC, or engage in social games (there are studies that actually show bingo helps enhance the brain function of senior citizens). If bingo has a healthy function, then imagine what great effects you would have from activities that actually engage more than 2 percent of your brain. Writing essays is an excellent way to practice your brain function, and of course reading is outstanding. Whether you're reading fiction or non-fiction, you're engaging your creativity, your memory, your vocabulary and using your brain in a way that will support its healthy function for a long time to come. Now, as you're doing all of this, you may be interested to know healthy brain function also boosts healthy body function. Because, there's a whole field known as psychoneuroimmunology that looks at the links between brain chemistry and immune system function, and it turns out when you have a healthy, active brain, you have a much more active immune system. That can extend your life, so working to boost your brain function can have side effects that directly enhance the health of your body and your ability to fight off chronic disease. Boosting brain function literally helps you live longer. Have you ever known someone who was really sharp until the day they retired from their job? Then they decided to sit back and take it easy. They went on a few vacations, started watching a lot of television and next thing you know, they died. What happened? They stopped engaging their brain, their immune system function suffered and they succumbed to some sort of chronic disease like cancer. This is all initiated by their loss of brain exercise. Brain exercise can have a huge impact on your longevity, and it's perhaps one of the best anti-aging strategies you can pursue. Now, you'll notice all these strategies I've mentioned here are based on transforming yourself from the inside, not changing your external appearance. There's a great tendency in our society today to focus on the external appearance. For example: You have these TV shows like 'The Swan,' where they show people who are seemingly incredibly happy from having their appearance altered through cosmetic surgery, liposuction, anti-wrinkle creams, hair dyes and things like that. I think it's quite ridiculous to see this going on, but it's very typical of American society just to focus on the outward appearance and not really spend time on the internal transformation. Why? Its because internal transformation takes effort. It takes time, and it's something that requires you to take responsibility. The things I'm talking about here in terms of strategies are those internal transformation strategies like altering your nutrition, engaging in brain function, changing your lifestyle and taking up regular physical exercise; doing these things will make you much younger in every measurable way. If you took a biological measurement of your age, you can actually reverse that biological age through outstanding nutrition, physical exercise, brain exercise, herbal supplements and so on. You can't do that with cosmetics. All you can do is cover up your age, and the older you get the more you have to cover up. In fact, popular cosmetics are made with such dangerous ingredients that they actually impair your health, can create liver toxicity, clog up skin pores and introduce a lot of toxic chemicals into your system causing you to age faster. Before long you need more cosmetics than ever, and then you're caught in this endless downward spiral of unhealthy addiction to cosmetics and cosmetic surgery. Unfortunately, that's where a lot of people are today. What I'm saying is, take a different path. Don't cover up your wrinkles, exercise your face instead; don't get liposuction, change your life and lose that body fat naturally, permanently, in a way that greatly enhances your energy, vitality and reverses your biological age at the same time. Don't lie to the world by dyeing your hair black when you have some gray in it. Let the hair be gray, and blow people away with your sharp cognitive function. Show people you're just as sharp, if not sharper, than anybody younger than you, plus you have wisdom and experience to go along with it. That's something youth simply cannot offer. If you still find yourself in a job where you're being punished for your biological age, even though you have the sharpest brain of anybody in your department, then I say you're in the wrong job. You need to go find a place that respects you as a human being, honors your mental capacity and hires people for their capabilities rather than their good looks. There are places like that out there. I know, because I run one of those companies, and the very first thing I look for when I'm hiring people is how genuine they are -- their level of authenticity. I want to see someone as they really are; I want to know their mental capabilities, their attitudes and their interests. I want to know what they're really like. If someone comes in for an interview and they're all covered up with makeup, to me, that's an instant red flag, because I can't tell who's underneath all that stuff. There are companies like that out there. I encourage you to find one, and then work to boost your mental capacity. Engage in those brain exercises. Give up the unhealthy foods that impair nervous system function and adopt a new, healthy lifestyle with nutritional supplements, naturopathic health care, and invest in yourself. If you think about it, when you purchase cosmetics, liposuction and these other services, you're not investing in yourself. You're investing in those surgeons or those companies that sell those cosmetics, because you have to keep using them over and over again. You might as well buy stock in Elizabeth Arden, because you're buying so much of their product. In contrast, when you take the natural route and transform yourself from the inside out, you are investing in yourself, and that's an investment you can take with you each and every day. Because, when you wake up after that health transformation, and you look in the mirror, you look beautiful even without touching any makeup whatsoever. You look young, energized and sharp. You've taken all that effort and invested it in yourself, and that will pay dividends for you each and every day for the rest of your life. Also, you won't be financially tied to some line of cosmetic products that really just cover up the signs of aging and put on a fake presentation for the world around you. If you're going to go for some cosmetics, definitely use the natural cosmetics. There are organic products. There are high-end natural cosmetic products made with really healthy ingredients. Stay away from the artificial petroleum stuff. Stay away from the brand-name cosmetics and go with the small, natural companies that have products that can really make a difference. Because, I agree that sometimes in the professional world, you're in situations where you need to have some lipstick on, or you need to have eye shadow. That's expected by your coworkers, and that's fine. I'm not saying you should walk into every situation without any makeup. However, if you're going to use makeup, use the natural stuff, and don't rely on makeup to change your personal appearance in the long run. Alter your lifestyle so you can be healthy and vibrant all the time, even if you're not wearing makeup. Then if you're in a situation where you have to use makeup for professional reasons, then that makeup only enhances the natural, vibrant look you already have. For men, if you're worried about your job, and you want to look younger, I say skip the cosmetic surgery, skip the toxic hair dyes, focus on your level of energy and your mental function. You can look younger and more vibrant by changing who you are inside much better than by changing your appearance on the outside. Sooner or later, people will look past your hair color and your cosmetic surgery, and they will look at who you are inside and what capabilities you bring to the table. That's where you want to compete. Otherwise, you're competing in a losing game, because there's always somebody out there who's younger and better-looking than you are. Unless you're in the modeling industry, it just doesn't make sense to undergo potentially dangerous operations and radical procedures just to alter your appearance for a new job. "
0," The great swine flu hoax of 2009 is now falling apart at the seams as one country after another unloads hundreds of millions of doses of unused swine flu vaccines. No informed person wants the injection anymore, and the entire fear-based campaign to promote the vaccines has now been exposed as outright quackery and propaganda. Even doctors are now calling the pandemic a complete hoax. As reported on FoxNews, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a leading health authority in Europe, says that drug companies 'organized a 'campaign of panic' to put pressure on the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic. He believes it is 'one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century,' and he has called for an inquiry.' ( http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582749,0... ) H1N1 swine flu was never dangerous , and it never should have been escalated to a level-six pandemic in the first place. It was all a big marketing scam whose purpose was to simply sell vaccines . (And the CDC and WHO were in on it...) And it worked! Big Pharma made out with billions of dollars in profits for a useless vaccine that's now being dumped by the truck load. These vaccines were, of course, paid for with taxpayer dollars, making the Great Swine Flu Hoax of 2009 nothing more than an elaborate financial scam whose goal was to transfer wealth from the People to the shareholders of Big Pharma. In just the fourth quarter of 2009, GlaxoSmithKline shipped $1.4 billion worth of vaccines. ( http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60E1SU... ) That's $1.4 billion worth of taxpayer dollars, by the way. Dollars that could have been spent on nutrition or real health education. $1.4 billion worth of free vitamin D supplements would have done far more to protect public health than vaccines could ever hope to accomplish. A bailout for Big Pharma Wall Street hucksters have nothing on Big Pharma, the CDC and the WHO, all of which conspired to mislead the public and generate irrational fear in order to make money selling people vaccine shots they never needed in the first place. The drug companies raked in billions of dollars in revenues while providing a product that offered absolutely no net reduction in mortality. In fact, as the long-term side effects of the vaccines remain unknown, it could turn out that the vaccines actually result in a net increase in mortality. Meanwhile, countless people were harmed by the swine flu vaccine frenzy (it's 'countless' because nobody's counting). In addition to those who were nearly paralyzed after receiving the vaccine shots, grade school staffers in Massachusetts who lined up to receive swine flu vaccine shots were instead injected with insulin . (Insulin injections can put you into a coma.) ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content... ) The school sent a letter home to staffers and parents blaming the mishap on the school nurse. But if they weren't injecting people with a useless vaccine for a non-pandemic, none of this would have happened in the first place. (Editor's note: The press originally reported this story as 'children' being injected with insulin, but they later changed their report to 'staffers.' This paragraph has been updated to reflect that change.) Total swine flu deaths for 2009 were far lower than the number of deaths from regular seasonal flu. And yet it turns out that thousands of Americans who died from the swine flu had been previously injected with the vaccines ( http://www.selfnews.com/027956_H1N1_vacci... ). In fact, according to calculations derived from official CDC estimates, thousands of vaccinated Americans died from swine flu anyway . The vaccines , it seems, don't really work after all. You're just as safe doing nothing. Actually, getting the vaccine may harm your health. Outspoken Dr. Wodarg even says that the full extent of the damage from the insufficiently-tested vaccines may not be known for years. 'The vaccine developed by Novartis was produced in a bioreactor from cancerous cells, a technique that had never been used until now,' he says. Just what we need, huh? Cancer cells being injected into the population as part of a vaccine campaign. Cancelling vaccine orders The Swine Flu hoax has fizzled out, and countries like Greece, France and the UK have cancelled orders for vaccines that they now realize won't be needed ( http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60I0RI... ) ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8448080.st... ). But even the fizzling of this hoax doesn't mean it was a failure from the point of view of Big Pharma. The swine flu hoax was a huge success not only for drug company profits, but also for certain influential individuals including Dr Julie Gerberding, former head of the CDC who has now accepted a high-paying job as the president of Merck's global vaccine operations. ( http://www.selfnews.com/027789_Dr_Julie_G... ) One minute you're running the CDC, warning the country about a pandemic while urging everybody to get vaccinated, and the next minute you're running the for-profit vaccine division of the world's largest drug company. Amazing how that works, huh? We called it right I called much of this months ago in my popular hip-hop song, 'Don't Inject Me' which you can listen to here: http://www.selfnews.com/Dont_Inject_Me_Th... Or watch on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiXmw5a9kiM As I stated in the song lyrics, which were written in early August, 2009: The truth is outrageous Don't you know the drug companies made this flu Don't you know the swine flu is made by man Pharmaceutical scam It's all part of the Big Brother population plan They don't want you to see the remedies you can stop influenza with vitamin D for free Herbal medicine is all that you need But they can't charge a fifty dollar fee Unless They inject you The big drug companies are makin' a killing Collectin' the billions and gettin' away like a James Bond villain Cuz' they're willin' to do almost anything Just to make money with the flu vaccine Many clueless critics thought this song was some sort of outrageous conspiracy rant at the time. Turns out it was a spot-on prediction of the truth behind The Great Swine Flu hoax of 2009 . Sources for this story include: Fox News http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582749,0...

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The breast cancer industry operates a racist medical racket that exploits black women for corporate profits, charges consumer health advocate Mike Adams in a newly-published online report: Breast Cancer Deception . The report, available now at www.NewsTarget.com reveals the obvious reason why black women suffer higher rates of breast cancer (with greater mortality) than whites. It also charges the breast cancer industry with intentionally denying black women access to the information they need to prevent nearly 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer using a simple nutrient available for free that's actually manufactured by the human body under the right conditions. The report is available online now at: www.NewsTarget.com/Report_Breast_Cancer_Dece... 'The breast cancer industry is dominated by wealthy white men who are, in my view, exploiting the bodies of low-income black women in order to generate obscene corporate profits,' Adams said. 'The industry refuses to educate black women about the real reasons why their cancers are more severe than white women, and it simultaneously refuses to teach black women the simple, natural solution to breast cancer prevention that can reduce national breast cancer rates by over 75 percent.' Adams backs up his assertions with charts from the National Cancer Institute as well as considerable research into the effects of vitamin D on the halting of cancer tumor growth. By combining three simple observations -- the sunlight blocking capacity of darkly pigmented skin, ultraviolet light intensity at geographic latitudes, and recent research showing vitamin D's ability to prevent cancer tumors from growing -- Adams has pieced together a powerful, yet obvious explanation for why black men and women experience far more serious cancers than whites. The cancer industry, meanwhile, remains baffled by the difference and claims to not understand why black women experience more severe cancers than white women. The real explanation for the difference? Chronic vitamin D deficiency caused by darker skin pigmentation, indoor work environments, and dark-skinned people living at Northern latitudes (such as the Northern half of the United States, Canada or the U.K.) where sunlight intensity is greatly reduced. These factors explain why virtually all black children being born in the United States today are vitamin D deficient ( see article ) and why black women suffer such severe cases of breast cancer. Vitamin D circulating in the blood has the ability halt breast cancer tumor growth, but chronic deficiency allows cancer tumors to grow unregulated. The breast cancer industry, Adams says, feeds upon the nutritional ignorance of black women and even seeks to keep them ignorant where they can be exploited through a system of 'medical slavery' that transforms the bodies of black women into cash-generating machines for pharmaceutical companies and cancer non-profit groups. Pink ribbon products are a 'sham' says Adams, and many of the products promoted with pink ribbons actually cause cancer, he says. Furthermore, no consumers seem to know where the pink ribbon donation money is actually going or whether it's doing any good. 'One thing for sure is that nobody is bothering to fund educational campaigns that would teach black women how to actually prevent breast cancer and avoid the disease altogether.' The cancer industry, Adams says, is banking on the continuation of the disease and simply cannot afford to have 80 percent of black women avoid breast cancer entirely. 'The loss in revenues and jobs to the cancer industry would be devastating,' he explains. 'Keeping cancer alive and well is a matter of survival for the cancer industry which is now focused entirely on generating profits, not preventing cancer,' Adams charges. Additional details are revealed in Adams' special report, Breast Cancer Deception , which is available now at: www.NewsTarget.com/Report_Breast_Cancer_Dece... The report is available free of charge, and Adams earns no money from any of the numerous anti-cancer product recommendations made in the report.

0," A mother of three has met the brutal hand of the insanely powerful biotechnology industry, which recently sent a duo of thugs to literally beat her relentlessly after earlier threatening to murder her. GM Watch reports that Sofia Gatica, who has successfully spearheaded campaigns to block plantings of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in her home country of Argentina, was targeted by two men on motorbikes who very likely would have killed her if it were not for the intervention of her neighbors. Reports indicate that the men approached Gatica near her work, just 72 hours after she received a terrifying death threat. An outspoken activist on issues relating to GMOs, Gatica led the charge back in 2012 to require that chemical companies first prove the safety of their poisons before gaining official approval for their use in Argentina. She is also currently leading efforts to prevent the establishment of a new Monsanto facility in the Malvinas region of Argentina, where she helped set up blockades to impede construction. 'I was at the bus stop and two men appear on a motorcycle in the opposite direction,' recalls Sofia about her terrifying experience at the hands of pro-GMO thugs. 'One jumped on top of me and they kicked and beat me. I screamed loudly and the neighbors came out to help me,' she adds, noting in a separate interview with La Voz del Interior that the men hit her 'neck, arms, legs, everything.' The unidentified assailants did not steal anything from Gatica, nor did they target her property or her neighbors, which leads her to believe that the attack was prompted by the very industry players that she actively works to prevent from destroying her homeland. Argentina, after all, is a major biotech target and is currently the world's third largest exporter of Monsanto's Roundup Ready GM soybeans, which require heavy applications of deadly chemicals. Gatica filed a complaint with local police not long after the incident but was wary about having to enlist the help of guards for protection. But with three little ones at home and more work to be done on the food freedom front, Gatica has cooperated with local law enforcement and agreed to have an armed guard stand watch at her property. 'I didn't want to have guards watching over me,' she told Cordoba's Canal 10 news. 'I just want the people of Monsanto to leave me in peace.' Gatica's fourth child was reportedly killed by Monsanto's chemicals As you may recall from earlier reports, Gatica's fourth child died as a result of being exposed to Monsanto's agricultural chemicals. Her other three children have also since tested positive for agro-chemicals in their blood, a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly problematic in Argentina, as major industry players continue to set up GM crop fields in close proximity to residential areas. As far as the current efforts by Monsanto to establish a new facility in Malvinas, the world's most evil corporation is attempting to bypass the law by gaining access to new land for planting without first submitting a proper environmental impact study. Gatica and many other local residents are obviously opposed to this takeover and have made their voices heard in recent days by setting up the blockades and gathering signatures for a petition. 'We call the whole of organized society to accompany this measure of strength to show solidarity in the struggle against the multinational [corporation] and for food sovereignty and life,' reads an Avaaz.org petition created for people all over the world to sign, translated from Spanish. 'It is necessary to join forces with all environmental and territorial conflicts of Argentina ... [and say] no to transgenic food.' You can sign the petition here: https://secure.avaaz.org . "
0," Due to extensive poaching in which the perceived value of their horns seems to matter more than their lives, the northern white rhino population has dwindled severely through the years. While many people may consider numbers in the hundreds or even thousands small, in the instance of the northern white rhino, the numbers are much more shocking; they can literally be counted on one hand. Sadly, with the recent natural death of Angalifu, a 44-year-old rhino at San Diego's National Safari Park, there are now only five left on the planet. While it's good news that they're under the protection of zoos and wildlife reserves, the bad news is that it's unlikely that the remaining rhinos will produce offspring, as it's very rare for rhinos to breed in captivity. In fact, the female rhino at the San Diego Park, Nola (who is still living), was unable to produce offspring with Angalifu. (1,2) Furthermore, there is only one male of this species left. Named Sudan, he lives in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Two females, Najin and Fatu, live with him. Elsewhere, there's an elderly female rhino living in the Czech Republic at the Dvur Kralove Zoo. (3) 'Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us,' said the safari park curator, Randy Rieches. '[N]ot only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction.' (3) Dire need to protect wildlife from extinction The need for such animals to be put in captivity is essential to help save the species. Despite no supporting scientific evidence, many in Asian cultures -- where the horns are in high demand -- believe that the horns harness medicinal powers and that they're a sign of wealth. Their horns, which contain keratin, are considered very valuable on the black market, where an ounce of it can earn someone a quick $5,550, give or take. That figure is estimated to be of more worth than the price of gold or platinum. (4) Unfortunately, though, the poaching has continued, killing them or forcing animals out of their natural habitat. Then situations such as old age takes its toll as it did for Angalifu. Couple natural deaths with the odds of producing offspring, and many feel that complete extinction of this particular rhino is only a matter of time. That is, unless science steps in. Can science and technology step in to help save the rhino and other animals? Efforts have been looked into to help these northern white rhinos reproduce via in vitro fertilization. However, most people are familiar with this taking place among cows, where the process is fairly easy and relatively inexpensive. The story is vastly different with rhinos, where the process is only in the experimental stages. 'You're dealing with a semi-wild, what, 2-ton animal?' said the CEO of Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Richard Vigne. 'Which is very different than dealing with completely domesticated cattle.' Vigne was involved with an effort that airlifted northern white rhinos from a Czech Republic zoo to Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy with the hopes of providing the animals with a more natural habitat that was more conducive to mating. Unfortunately, while a pair was found mating in 2009, no offspring were produced. (2) Instead, there are talks of exploring another avenue which involves extraction of a northern white rhino egg, fertilizing it with frozen northern white rhino sperm, then implanting it in a surrogate womb of the southern white rhino which is a genetically different subspecies. While the northern and southern white rhinos look very similar, the southern has a larger front horn and a difference in terrain preferences from the northern. (2) But what makes this approach more viable, perhaps, is that the southern white rhino has made a comeback; once numbering a mere 20, protection and successful breeding efforts have put their current numbers around 14,000. (2) In the meantime, to help stave off poachers who continue to kill other animals such as black rhino and elephants, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are being eyed as a beneficial wildlife-saving mechanism. The craft, or drones as they're often called, use high-spec night and thermal imaging technologies and can be programmed to hover over wildlife areas to spot would-be poachers in a manner that isn't disruptive to the animals. It's just one of many ways to bring technology into the equation; radio towers that monitor animal tracking tags are also being examined as a means to save wildlife from extinction.

0," The president of the United States has his priorities mixed up. And what's more, he ought to be ashamed of himself. That isn't a Democrat or Republican criticism. It is a statement of fact regarding any American president who would allow illegal aliens the 'right' to protest on a taxpayer-bought-and-paid-for National Mall he ordered closed to American citizens - who also happen to be veterans of World War II - at the risk of being arrested by uniformed Secret Service officers in riot gear. As reported by Breitbart News over the weekend: Secret Service and police in riot gear arrived to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sunday to monitor veterans demanding that memorials barricaded due to the government shutdown be re-opened. Though the Obama administration barricaded open-air memorials and even previously threatened to arrest World War II veterans on 'Honor Flights' to see their memorial, they allowed pro-amnesty demonstrators, including many illegal immigrants, to use the National Mall, which was supposed to be closed due to the shutdown, for a rally in support of comprehensive immigration reform. Democrats in Congress - like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - were allowed to ride to the event in golf carts. For this president, illegal aliens take precedence over World War II veterans Yes, that's right. Democrats like Pelosi - who thanked Obama for allowing the Mall to be opened for the rally - and Vice President Biden have nothing but praise for illegal aliens, but they aren't lifting a finger to ensure access to a memorial for fragile World War II vets who likely won't live long enough to see it again. Not all U.S. political figures and leaders are as misguided and heartless, as reported by Breitbart News : Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who addressed the veterans along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) at the 'Million Vet March,' said that during what she said should be referred to as the 'government slim-down,' President Obama was showing not only his real priorities but a 'shameful' 'lack of valor' and 'lack of respect.' On her Facebook page , rally attendee LaDonna Hale Curzon from Virginia wrote that, prior to Palin's arrival, there was more shameful behavior on the part of federal officers and local police, who she said moved in and 'attempted to shut down the event.' She also wrote that 'two police cruisers blocked entrance into the WWII memorial, in an effort to stop truckers from arriving from the highway' and 'four marked Secret Service vehicles arrived on the scene, joining dozens of law enforcements, who had already arrived, including a SWAT team dressed in full riot gear.' All across the Internet Monday, pictures of police in riot gear, squad cars and even armored 'riot' vehicles were seen at the event. What the president did is disgraceful, period 'Police blocked the road leading up to the WWII memorial from both directions,' wrote Curzon. 'What a nice way to spend my Sunday morning and to see how our veterans are treated at their own memorial. Last week, the Obama administration opened the mall for immigration activist protest yet blocked WWII vets in wheelchairs to see the WWII memorial. What is happening to our country?!' Later, scores of demonstrators disassembled the metal barricades around the memorial and took them to the White House nearby, where they tossed them in heaps. Regardless of your politics, it says much about the mindset of a president who would seek to punish veterans of the greatest war of the Greatest Generation, over nothing more than petty party politics and ideology. That Obama never served is not the point; that he would ever seek to punish those who have is a disgrace. Sources: http://www.breitbart.com http://weaselzippers.us http://thehill.com "
0," Another influential group has joined the pushback to stop forced vaccinations in California: the black community. Speaking on behalf of Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan, Minister Tony Muhammad, the group's Western Regional Representative, gave a rousing speech in front of the capitol building in Sacramento earlier this week urging unification in the fight to stop corrupt lawmakers from eliminating vaccine exemptions. Invoking the power of God in what he says is a 'universal fight,' Muhammad warned rally attendees that the government is basically waging war against the people by trying to mandate vaccinations. As long as we let them, compromised elected officials like Senate Bill 277's Dr. Richard Pan will gradually chip away at our collective rights, in this case the right to refuse dangerous medical treatment, until these tyrants assume complete control over every decision we make, including for our own children. Comparing SB 277 to another Tuskegee-type experiment on humans, Muhammad expressed deep convictions about the heinous bill, which would disallow California parents the freedom to reject vaccinations for personal or philosophical reasons. Only medical doctors, it turns out, would be granted permission to decide whether or not other people's children should be exempted from vaccination, removing proper guardianship of parents over their own children and handing it over to the state. 'When Pharaoh saw that he could not control the people, Pharaoh called his enchanters or his magicians and he made a decree to destroy all boy babies two and under,' thundered Muhammad to a boisterous crowd on the capitol steps, referencing a biblical story of similar government tyranny that resulted in mass death. 'Could this be a bill to destroy all boy babies?' Watch Muhammad's six-minute speech at the rally : Politicians who support mandatory vaccination to be charged with treason Such a comparison is strikingly chilling in light of the fact that vaccines have been proven to cause horrific damage in children, including young boys who in some cases suffer permanent hormonal changes as a result of early exposure to vaccines. The presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in many vaccines was highlighted in a 2009 report by The Huffington Post that links them to the autism epidemic. '[M]ost vaccines contain aluminum adjuvants used to increase immune response, and aluminum is an endocrine-disrupting chemical,' reported The Huffington Post 's Deirdre Imus, referencing the work of Dr. Harvey Karp. 'Like it or not, vaccines are likely the largest source of one-time exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in early infant development.' The implications of this from a societal perspective are sobering, and seem to explain, at least in part, why so many children today now suffer from severe developmental disorders and chronic disease. Muhammad maintains that legislators who support SB 277 and other such medical tyranny are guilty of treason, promising at the rally that they will eventually be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. 'You will not vaccinate our children in the name of the pharma companies,' he bellowed before a crowd of supporters. 'And I'm here to warn [the politicians] that this building doesn't belong to them; it belongs to us. ... In the name of God, we're going to win.... We will put these people in check. They belong to us. They cannot do this to our future.' 'We will never allow the vaccine makers to take advantage of our children who can't speak for themselves. So I say to you: let us stay united, and let us say no to SB 277.' You can view the roughly six-minute video clip of Muhammad's speech above or visit: YouTube.com .

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Creativity is defined as the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc. Creativity is easy to define, but researchers often question how it can be measured and how people have different aptitudes for creativity. Hypnosis aides in the research of creativity, and it also allows psychologists to study the relationship between creativity and hypnotizability. It is thought that hypnosis aides in the research of creativity. The state of hypnosis creates an altered state of consciousness; this makes hypnosis a good tool to use in the research of creative states and fantasy proneness. It is thought that hypnosis may lead to a breakthrough in understanding the origin of creative inspiration. Bowers and van der Meulen (1970) performed a study involving 30 highly suggestible people and 30 participants who were not as suggestible. The study involved many tests of creative functioning including creative tasks, inkblots, and association tests. The results of the study showed that those who were more highly hypnotizable performed better in the creative tests. The study also concluded that women were more creative than men. Another study was conducted to study the relationship between hypnosis and creativity. Hypnosis was used to measure the degree of effortless response to tasks involving creativity. The study consisted of students and writers who were asked to write while in a hypnotic state. The researcher also looked at the various creative styles of the participants. The results showed that more creativity was at its highest when there was no interference between associations and problem solving (Bowers, 1979). Lynn and Rhue (1988) screened 6,000 students to find 780 participants in their study. They were divided into three groups based on their fantasy proneness. They were then compared based on measures of hypnotizability, imagination , waking suggestibility, hallucinatory ability, creativity, psychopathology, and childhood experiences. The researchers found that there was less of a link between fantasy proneness and hypnotizability than originally thought. This means that even those who are not creative are likely to respond positively to hypnosis . It was also found that those who were more prone to fantasy and creativity were not necessarily highly suggestible under hypnosis. Although these studies differ in making a connection between suggestibility and creativity, all of the studies have made interesting conclusions involving creativity and hypnosis. The state of hypnosis allows researchers to study creativity in a non-invasive and natural way. More research should be conducted to learn more about creativity and imagination.

0," With a sad twist of irony, corporate and government elite dine on safe, organic food while the masses, those very people who are supposedly represented and protected by their governments, are poisoned by hidden genetically modified organisms, pesticides and dangerous contaminants. The presidential family demands organic food in their kitchen, yet behind closed doors, shake hands with the biotech industry. China's top brass is fed by an exclusive, gated organic garden while the rest of the population consumes GM food, steroid contaminated meat and dairy laced with melamine. Even Monsanto's own employee's command non-genetically modified food in their canteen. Access to clean, organic and healthy food is not a given right anymore -- it has become a political battleground with the average citizen suffering the loss. White House double-take While First Lady Michelle Obama digs up the White House lawn to plant an organic garden, her husband promotes a GMO agenda within his administration. 'You know, in my household, over the last year we have just shifted to organic,' she said in a New Yorker interview during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Organic produce from the garden feeds the Obama family and visiting dignitaries alike. Seems okay so far. But then take a look at Obama's laundry-list of presidential appointed positions with biotech ties: USDA head Roger Beachy, a former director at Monsanto, FDA food safety czar Michael Taylor, one-time vice president for public policy at Monsanto , Commissioner of the USDA Tom Vilsack who created the Governors' Biotechnology Partnership. Under President Obama, 10 new GM crops have been approved for 'safe consumption.' Spiked fences protect organic gardens from the people The political elite in China enjoy the safest of food -- organic produce, grass-fed beef from Inner Mongolia, rice free of pesticides, chemicals or genetically modified organisms. Compare this with the food supply of ordinary citizens that is laden with pesticides, industrial chemicals and GMOs. Children have become sick and died from tainted baby formula and milk products. Blindness and death have resulted from adults consuming fake liquor. Yet Chinese leaders have their own protected food sources of the highest quality. In Beijing, an organic farm is surrounded by a six-foot spiked fence while security personnel guard the entrance. The garden produces food for top-notch officials only. Beidaihe Sanitorium, a seaside haven for retired party cadres, exclusively uses a specialty rice that is organic and free of GMOs. As for the public, they can purchase the small remaining surplus of the grain at 15 times the cost of regular rice. All the while, the government continues to approve GMOs and harmful chemicals for general consumption. GMO-free meals at Monsanto Remember the notice at a Monsanto staff canteen stating the decision 'to remove, as far as practicable, GM soya and maize from all food products served in our restaurant. We have taken the above steps to ensure that you, the customer, can feel confident in the food we serve.' According to Tony Coombes, the company's spokesperson, 'Yes, this is the case, and it is because we believe in choice.' Evidently the average citizen is not allowed the same courtesy of choice considering GMOs have infiltrated the food supply and are not labeled in North America. Only those who can afford the price tag of organic food are able to protect themselves from harmful contaminants. As for the rest of the population, they are the ones who will suffer the devastating health consequences of a corrupt system. "
0," For someone who founded the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, has deep admiration for the late cosmologist Carl Sagan, and touts the impressive wonders of space, Neil deGrasse Tyson sure doesn't seem all that interested in turning to planetary discoveries to help save Earth. In fact, he seems outright determined to destroy the very planet he lives on. When addressing a question during a recent appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher , Tyson was asked his thoughts regarding the possibility of droughts striking that are more disastrous than the ones in California. Tyson's response had nothing to do with space exploration or improving conditions on Earth as one might logically assume based on his background. His response? 'You know what I want to happen? I think it's not about finding another planet. I think it's about being masters of geo-engineering.' You can view his interview, which is in a video in the related story, here . It's interesting that Mr. Let's-Explore-Space apparently doesn't see any need to do so, at least according to the first part of his response. Whatever happened to an article he authored for Natural History magazine that appeared on HaydenPlanetarium.org entitled 'The Search for Planets'? The dangers of geoengineering He also mentions something else that is highly disturbing: becoming 'masters' of geoengineering. A Congressional Research Service report explains geoengineering as an 'array of technologies that aim, through large-scale and deliberate modifications of the Earth's energy balance, to reduce temperatures and counteract anthropogenic climate change.' Yes, this is what Tyson advocates. Such technologies primarily focus on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) methods that involve ocean fertilization, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and increasing the earth's reflectivity. We're talking about carbon dioxide extraction, aerosol injections, and space-based reflectors to get the planet back on track. That same report warns that the technologies have yet to be proven, which means that their risks and costs are largely unknown. 'If geoengineering technologies were to be deployed, they are expected to have the potential to cause significant transboundary effects,' it states. Ironically, Tyson's response to Maher about droughts is something that by it's very nature can actually create more of them! In fact, a study published in Nature's Scientific Reports about the impact of artificially fertilizing the ocean led lead author Chien Wang to say that 'the rainfall response may adversely affect water resources, potentially impacting human livelihoods.' He concludes, 'Even if it were possible to artificially increase DMS emissions, we would not necessarily recommend such a course of action. In addition to potentially impacting the hydrological cycle and human livelihoods, ocean fertilisation may present many other dangers that we have not explored here, such as the impact on marine ecosystems.' Is carbon dioxide really so awful? Then there are thoughts that all this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might be a good thing that is actually helping people rather than harming them. Of course, this begs the question of tampering with climate change in the first place; could it actually have its benefits? Indeed, people living in the southern strip of the Sahara Desert would say yes. After droughts there in the 70s and 80s killed more than 100,000 people, the area is now experiencing increased rainfall and a 're-greening' that is linked to those bad words, 'climate change.' It's thought that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has led to this change, creating more plant growth and community-led farming efforts in the region. Neil, are you listening? Geoengineering is not anything we need to be masters of! When someone advocates GMOs, don't take their other suggestions seriously Nevertheless, Tyson outlines his geoengineering thoughts as follows: 'Think about it: We run away from volcanos, we know how to tap a keg let's tap the volcano, take the pressure out so it doesn't explode, use the thermal energy to drive the power needs of a city. We run away from hurricanes, we're not there yet. Imagine if we controlled the energy of the earth oh, my gosh. Then we can control where it rains (and) how much it rains. We're just these scurrying, scared things.' This comes from a man who also applauds GMOs, saying they are the same as selective breeding. "
0," Thanks to the train wreck of the government's Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, large regional sick care providers and hospitals are sniffing the air for solutions that cut out insurance providers completely. The complexity of Obamacare appears to be more of an insurance company bailout than an effort toward a single-payer universal healthcare system. The ACA system keeps most of those private corporate insurance companies in the loop with a system that is enforced by IRS tax penalties for not enrolling. Because the ACA's halfhearted boondoggle to help those who can't afford private insurance winds up creating more costs for those who can afford insurance plans while creating federal deficits and higher health costs, there are hospital and healthcare organizations floating ideas around with how to cut out insurance providers completely. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, University of Pennsylvania professor claims that we're beginning to see what he called the 'Kaiserification' of our healthcare system. This is a reference to the Kaiser Permenente system that includes its own hospitals and clinics within their own consumer-paid coverage. Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, CEO and president of the Mount Sinai Health System in New York State, said Mt. Sinai will begin offering its own Medicare Advantage plan. It will look for other opportunities to bring premium payments directly into the hospital system, rather than filtering them through insurance companies. Davis expects organizations similar to his to move in the same direction. 'Inevitably the large systems are going to move to take part of the premium dollar,' he confirmed. Is this what we really want? All this is for a medical system that ranks 46th out of 48 nations rated. Yet, according to the WHO (World Health Organization), America's healthcare per capita costs rank second only to Switzerland, which is in the top ten for overall healthcare rankings. That means we are spending almost the very most for one of the lowest-ranking medical systems in the world. Only Serbia and Brazil are worse, while China and Cuba are better. Those socialized or single-payer medical systems generally spend less, as medical costs are usually reviewed with the intention of cutting expenses. The accusations of socialism and communism toward Obamacare are misplaced in my opinion. According to Adolf Hitler's primary inspiration for fascism, Benito Mussolini, fascism is 'the marriage of corporation and state.' He also asserted, 'Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.' Here's just one obvious example in the land of the free: Big Pharma is a group of corporations protected by the FDA, a government agency. Obamacare is designed to keep several corporate insurers in business by forcing more into chosen carriers' plans. Many countries with socialized medicine are generally more open to other forms of medical treatments than here in the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand. Our medical monopoly system excludes coverage for most other forms of healthcare that are more effective, less expensive and much safer. So the insurance racket is actually part of the medical mafia . Meanwhile, US iatrogenic (caused by medicine) disease and death rates exceed all other causes of death , including the top disease killers, accidents and murder. (Source below) Obamacare makes alternative healthcare choices even more difficult. Using IRS penalties for non-enrollment forces individual insurance premium payments, which many think will continue to rise. Thus, money budgeted for out-of-pocket alternative health solutions is taken out of the equation, forcing financial support for a system that harms more than helps. Call it whatever '-ism' you want, Obamacare makes health freedom more elusive than ever for most of us. And the latest strategies by mainstream medical monopolists to cut out insurance companies will only continue to promote Big Pharma's drugs and exclude safe, effective and inexpensive treatments. "
0," With the threat of the Ebola virus spreading, there is a need to understand what natural options are readily available to you in case you don't want to be subjected to conventional medical treatments and infected patients in hospitals. The only proven system to help eradicate the Ebola virus is your body's immune system, and it is of primary importance to start strengthening its response now to give yourself the best chance of successfully fighting off an infection. Work with your body's natural defenses The only way to work with your body's natural defenses is to give it what it requires in order to function at optimal performance. Conventional medical wisdom claims that man-made remedies such as vaccines are superior to those provided by nature, but it doesn't take a scientist to understand that the toxic chemicals and preservatives injected into the body along with antigens is not a legitimate way to improve immunity. To improve your immunity, you must improve your relationship with nature and the medicine it provides, which has been proven to keep people healthy for thousands of years. In this case, a focus on healing foods and herbs that have strong antibacterial and antiviral properties is of primary importance, along with improving immune system function and eliminating foods that suppress it. Antibacterial foods, herbs, and solutions to begin consuming regularly Even though Ebola is a virus, it only makes sense to start clearing out any harmful bacteria in your digestive system in order for your immune system to function properly. This will allow it to do its job more efficiently, which is a must have when dealing with more deadly infections such as Ebola. Antibacterial foods and herbs to consider, include: "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The concept of universal health care that would cover every American citizen is again being proposed in the U.S. Senate, after a similar request was voted away over a decade ago. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., brought his vision for health care coverage that would leave no man, woman or child in America without health coverage, as several business and labor leaders on Wednesday hailed his proposal to provide health care coverage to all Americans through a pool of private insurance plans. Over 12 years ago, the U.S. Congress rejected a Clinton administration plan for universal health care. However, Sen. Wyden says his plan is different in that it would provide affordable, private health care coverage for all Americans -- except those covered through Medicare or the military -- using no more money that the country spends on health care today under the current system that leaves millions uninsured. Sen. Wyden said, 'Employer-based coverage is melting away like a Popsicle on the sidewalk in August,' and proposed a plan that would 'guarantee health coverage for every American that is at least as good as members of Congress receive, and can never be taken away.' Sen. Wyden's plan -- called the 'Healthy Americans Act' -- would provide universal coverage for no more money than the country spends on health insurance today, according to the Senator. He also drew support for his plan from groups that have frequently opposed each other -- including Andy Stern, international president of the Service Employees International Union, and Safeway Inc. CEO, Steve Burd. Mr. Stern called employer-based health coverage a relic of an industrial economy that is long gone. He added that U.S. companies 'cannot compete in a global economy when we put the price of health care on the cost of our products, and our competitor nations do not.' In addition, Sen. Wyden said his new plan would give American workers the ability to carry their health insurance from job to job without penalty. He added that more efficient administration and more promotion of competition for health care plans would allow greater coverage while costing no more than the government is paying today for health insurance coverage. Sen. Wyden's universal health care plan would also require that employers 'cash out' their existing health plans by terminating coverage and paying the amount saved directly to workers as increased wages, and then workers then could buy health insurance from a large pool of private plans with that same money. ### "
0," There is a very real public health crisis looming on the horizon, and its origins stem from the common food industry practice of force-feeding antibiotic drugs to cattle in order to bulk them up and rush their meat to market as quickly as possible. And a major consumer advocacy group is calling on the popular grocery chain Trader Joe's to step up and stop selling meat and poultry derived from animals raised in this manner, which is causing widespread health problems and antibiotic resistance. Consumers Union , the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports , recently ran a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times (LAT) petitioning Trader Joe's to be an industry leader on this important issue. Since Trader Joe's has already forged the way in taking a stand on other important health and food safety issues in the past, Consumers Union hopes Trader Joe's will once again do the right thing and nix conventional meat from its product lineup. You can view Consumer Union 's full-page ad here: http://notinmyfood.org 'Eighty percent of the antibiotics sold in the U.S. are used by the meat and poultry industries so factory farm animals can grow faster and tolerate crowded and unsanitary conditions,' reads the Consumers Union announcement. 'As a progressive retailer that has already demonstrated care for their customers' health by saying no to GMOs, artificial colors, and trans fats, Trader Joe's should take the obvious next step by helping move the livestock industry in the right direction - towards healthy animals raised without drugs.' Sign the petition urging Trader Joe's to stop selling drugged meats Though Trader Joe's admittedly sells a variety of organic, grass-fed, and antibiotic-free meat and poultry products, some of its food offerings still contain conventional varieties of these same meats from animals raised in typical CAFO conditions - CAFO stands for concentrated animal feeding operation, and represents the typical format in place at most factory farms. With an increasing number of informed Americans interested in safe, antibiotic-free meat and poultry, it only makes sense for Trader Joe's to take action now and lead the way towards improved meat production standards. 'It's critical that we do everything possible to curb the growing public health crisis of antibiotic resistance,' says Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiatives for Consumers Union . 'Virtually every respected medical and public health organization agrees that we must reduce the use of antibiotics in healthy livestock in order to preserve the effectiveness of these drugs to treat disease.' According to a recent press release, Consumers Union launched a campaign last year called Meat Without Drugs that aims to convince all grocery stores to scrap antibiotic-raised meats, starting with Trader Joe's. You can learn more about this vital campaign, and sign the petition urging Trader Joe's to be the first to take this important action, by visiting: http://www.meatwithoutdrugs.org 'Continuing to sell meat from animals that are routinely fed antibiotics contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance,' adds Halloran. 'As a company that has taken socially responsible stands on other issues, Trader Joe's could make an important contribution to improving public health by carrying only meat and poultry raised without antibiotics.'

0," Embattled Ukraine, which is currently under siege (practically) by a belligerent Russia, once upon a time used to be called the 'Breadbasket of the Soviet Union,' because most of the U.S.S.R.'s food came from there. Even after the U.S.S.R. dissolved, Ukraine continued to be productive agriculturally, though its production of other goods and services, by 1999, had fallen to 40 percent of what the country was producing in 1991, when the breakup took place, according to the CIA World Factbook . But now, while the Ukrainian government faces off against a powerful Russian army, the country's agricultural production is about to be ambushed as well, according to CounterPunch : On July 28, the California-based Oakland Institute released a report revealing that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), under terms of their $17 billion loan to Ukraine, would open that country to genetically-modified (GM) crops and genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture. The report is entitled 'Walking on the West Side: the World Bank and the IMF in the Ukraine Conflict.' GMOs are banned in Ukraine, but... CounterPunch reports further that, in late 2013, Viktor Yanukovych, who was then president of Ukraine, turned down an agreement with the European Union that was tied to a $17 billion International Monetary Fund loan; the terms of that agreement are just now becoming known. Instead, the Ukrainian leader chose an aid package from Russia which amounted to about $15 billion, in addition to a discount on Russian natural gas ( Ukraine gets nearly all of its natural gas from Russia, the CIA notes). Frederic Mousseau, Policy Directory of the Oakland Institute and co-author of 'Walking on the West Side,' reported that the discount was 33 percent. In any event, that decision was a major element of the ensuing deadly protests that eventually led to his ouster from office in February of this year, and the current crisis with Moscow. In a column for Inter Press Service, Mousseau wrote: Whereas Ukraine does not allow the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, Article 404 of the EU agreement, which relates to agriculture, includes a clause that has generally gone unnoticed: both parties will cooperate to extend the use of biotechnologies. In a report for Al Jazeera , Mousseau and Marin Kirk wrote: There is no doubt that this provision meets the expectations of the agribusiness industry. As observed by Michael Cox, research director at the investment bank Piper Jaffray, 'Ukraine and, to a wider extent, Eastern Europe, are among the most promising growth markets for farm-equipment giant Deere, as well as seed producers Monsanto and DuPont.' Under Ukrainian law, farmers are banned from growing GM crops in the country's rich black soil, which is more than favorable for growing grains; in 2012, Ukrainian farmers harvested more than 20 million tonnes of corn, CounterPunch reported. The not-so-hidden hands of Monsanto and Dupont Mousseau added that in the past 10 years Ukraine's agricultural sector has been defined by growth that has been concentrated increasingly within very large corporations that use large-scale, intensive farming systems. Most of them are foreign entities, and not surprisingly then, the percentage of land held foreign corporations is growing very rapidly; more than 1.6 million hectares have been signed away to foreign-owned corporations in recent years. Now, there is work afoot to ensure policies in Ukraine that ultimately benefit these (mostly) Western corporations. Though GMO crops are banned in Ukraine, Article 404 of the EU founding agreement, which pertains to agricultural production, contains a clause that has, until lately, gone virtually unnoticed: Both parties must cooperate on the use of biotechnologies. 'Given the struggle for resources in Ukraine and the influx of foreign investors in the agriculture sector, an important question is whether the results of the programme will benefit Ukraine and its farmers by securing their property rights or pave the way for corporations to more easily access property and land,' Mousseau reported. Therefore, there is an effort underway by mega-biotechs like DuPont and Monsanto to force open Ukraine's vast agricultural sector to foreign corporations and the influence that they seek to peddle.

0," Tweet Following widespread criticism by the public over proposed CAM Guidelines that the agency tried to slip under the radar (see below), the Food and Drug Administration has now extended the deadline for public comment to May 29. (It was previously April 30). The CAM Guidelines ( click here to read them yourself ) represent a new era of thinking at the FDA and describe the agency's intentions to regulate herbs, functional foods, therapeutic oils, nutritional supplements and even physical devices such as massage rocks as either 'drugs' or 'medical devices.' Click here to read our previous story describing the CAM Guidlines. These guidelines have been widely described as a brazen FDA attempt to destroy naturopathy and alternative medicine. The FDA was petitioned on April 22 by health freedom attorney Ralph Fucetola, a trustee of the non-profit Natural Solutions Foundation ( www.HealthFreedomUSA.com ), to extend its deadline for public comment. The petition also specifically requested that the FDA hold public hearings on the issue, but no decision has apparently been made on that issue. It now seems that the FDA attempted to sneak the new CAM Guidelines under the radar, hoping the public would never notice the guidelines until they had already been adopted and approved. The original CAM Guidelines document was quietly posted by the FDA on the day after Christmas, 2006, yet did not appear in the Federal Register until several months later. By the time the document was able to be found and commented on by the natural health community, only about thirty days remained in the public comment period. Thanks to public pressure and the Natural Solutions Foundation petition, the public comment period has now been extended by an additional thirty days to May 29th. To date, more than 108,000 comments have been received by the FDA on their CAM Guidelines . The issue has received widespread coverage in the natural health community, including articles on NewsTarget.com. The Natural Solutions Foundation says that an additional 267,000 people attempted to post comments but were unable to do so. NewsTarget previously suggested that comments posted to the FDA might be intentionally ignored or deleted, and according to the NSF, letters that are written to the FDA about this docket are routinely ignored. Your comments are still needed to protect health freedom The most effective way to make your voice heard on this topic is to either post your comments electronically, or write your representative in Washington to apply pressure on the FDA from the legislative side. Click here to post your comments directly to the FDA on the FDA Docket Management Comment Form . Keep in mind that all comments become part of the official FDA record, so write your comments carefully. The Natural Solutions Foundation also has a web comment form posted here , which uses the 'Democracy In Action' engine to send comments to the FDA and adds your name to a petition asserting our collective right to health freedom. This petition needs approximately another 90,000 electronic signatures to be taken seriously by the FDA, so please consider signing this petition as well. 'My middle name is not Darth Vader' claims FDA official Late last week, John Weeks from The Integrator Blog ( click here for the full interview ) published an interview with Philip Chao, the only FDA official referenced in the CAM Guidelines document. That interview asks the important question: Why was the CAM Guidelines document posted in the Federal Register on February 27, with a comment deadline of April 30, when the document itself says there will be a 90 day comment period? The Integrator asks, 'Can't you see how, with a suspicious public out there and all this hoopla that just extending to 90 days from February 27 makes some sense.' Later in that interview, Philip Chao is asked if his middle name is Darth Vader. His response? 'No it is not.' This is the first time, to my knowledge, that an FDA employee has officially denied his name is Darth Vader. The campaign to keep you uninformed Interestingly, opinions are split in the health freedom communities over the interpretation of the CAM Guidelines and the involvement of those trying to stop it. NewsTarget has been strongly pressured by certain health freedom individuals to censor its reporting on this topic and remove any mention of the Natural Solutions Foundation or its website. We have also been told by some health freedom activists that the CAM Guidelines can be safely ignored and pose no threat whatsoever to health freedom. Common sense, however, dictates otherwise. Any document in which the FDA openly states its intention to regulate vegetable juice as a drug is clearly and unquestionably a threat to health freedom, regardless of the noise level in the current health freedom debate. It is my belief that those individuals and organizations attempting to silence the reporting on these CAM Guidelines are, in fact, working in opposition to health freedom, regardless of their self-proclaimed stance on the issue. Actions speak louder than words. Anyone can claim they're in favor of health freedom, but unless they're actually fighting for it where the rubber meets the road, so to speak, they're only standing in the way of those of us who actually are making a difference. Stopping these CAM Guidelines from becoming official FDA policy is, in my view, one very important action item that deserves our effort right now. There are many more, but this is one that we cannot ignore. If you believe in your right to purchase herbs, supplements, homeopathic remedies or other naturopathic or 'alternative' health items, please consider posting your comments using one (or both) of the links listed above. The petition to extend the deadline The April 22nd petition letter to extend the FDA deadline is reprinted, in part, below: April 22, 2007 Re: FDA Docket No. 2006D-0480 Request to Extend Time Period for Comments Reference is made to the Federal Register, February 27, 2007 (Volume 72, Number 38, Page 8756-8757), http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/E7-325... entitled: Draft Guidance for Industry on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and Their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. In the filed comments NSF submitted to the FDA, the organization emphasized what we see as the important distinction between 'treatment of disease' and its non-medical alternative, under AMA Ethics Code Opinion 3.04, 'therapies that may benefit.' The comments raised three demands: 1. That FDA hold public hearings before finalization of the draft guidance. 2. That FDA change the title of the guidance to use the phrase 'Complementary and Alternative Modalities' and not the prejudicial 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine' as in the draft. 3. That FDA recognize 'therapies that may benefit' as not the same as 'treatment of disease' and therefore not to be regulated as 'medicine.' The organization also alerted its supporters, in keeping with its educational purposes. Many of theses individuals filed their own or supporting comments. As of the date of this request, over 108,822 have done so, by one count. This does not include about 267,063 people who tried to post comments but did not succeed, yet. Many of these remaining people may still want to submit comments, but may not be able to do so by April 30, 2007, a stated deadline for comments. While the Federal Register Notice states such a time limit for the filing of comments, there is other indication of a 90 day comment period, after the date of publication in the Register. This would extend to period until May 28, 2007. Therefore, we are unsure of the effective end of comment period date, and as many more people want to comment, we must now request a clarification of the final date for the filing of comments and, if that date is April 30, 2007, Natural Solutions Foundation and the undersigned hereby request a 180 day extension of the period to comment, or such other extension as the Agency may consider reasonable. This issue is of such evident concern and importance to so many Americans that a substantial extension is required. Kindly inform me by return email or facsimile of the Agencys decision in this regard. The Foundation reserves all rights. Thank you, Ralph Fucetola JD, Trustee Assert your right to health freedom, or you'll lose it Understand that we, the members of the natural health community, are at war with the FDA. Even though we are peaceful people who would not initiate such a war, that war has been declared upon us. We must fight this effort to regulate our natural medicines out of existence, and we must do so through every peaceful means at our disposal: Signing petitions, writing letters, even perhaps marching in the streets with protest signs if it comes to that. Do not stand by idly and let the Food and Drug Administration turn America into a medical police state, funded by Big Pharma and enforced by armed FDA agents. (See the true history of armed FDA raids here .) Preserving your access to alternative medicine products is something worth fighting for. We must meet the FDA's attempts at medical tyranny head on, with overwhelming public outrage, and we must keep at it until we restore the freedoms we have been promised by the founding father of our nation. Today, America is neither a free democracy, nor a totalitarian police state. But it could go either way. And the direction it heads from this day forward is up to people like you. Will you demand your freedom? Or will you let it be slowly, secretly slipped away, one federal document at a time, until you wake up one day and find yourself standing alone in a world or medical tyranny where all the healers have been imprisoned, the herbs have all been banned and the public is chemically controlled under a system of lifetime medical treatment that keeps the drug corporations wealthy? Think about where this is all headed. The CAM Guidelines spell out the path the FDA wants to take us down. It's up to people like you to stop that effort and help restore genuine health freedom in our world. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Cancer rates are still higher among black Americans compared to their white counterparts, according to recent statistics released by the American Cancer Society. Rates among black men are higher by more than one-third over whites, and the rates for black women are higher by 18 percent. Blacks will represent almost 63,000 of the estimated 560,000 deaths of cancer in 2007, the ACS reports. They also will represent 153,000 of 1.7 million new cancer cases in 2007. 'African Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival rate of any other racial or ethnic group for most cancers,' according to the ACS web site. Mike Adams, a natural health advocate and published author, accused the medical profession of misinforming the black population about the benefits of sunlight, relating this to the higher prevalence of cancer among blacks. 'Blacks die from skin cancer at rates that far exceed whites because conventional medicine strives to keep black Americans in a state of ignorance concerning the need for sunlight and Vitamin D,' Adams said. 'Since dark skin pigmentation blocks Vitamin D synthesis in the skin, as many as 75 percent of blacks are chronically deficient in the anticancer vitamin. The way to save the lives of millions of black Americans over the next ten years is to tell the truth about sunlight and Vitamin D.' Most forms of cancer are more prevalent in blacks versus whites on an adjusted scale of rate per 100,000 people, however the few exceptions are cancers of the breast, skin, bladder and also leukemia, the report shows. Overall, cancer rates among blacks have decreased overall for the past century. However, lung cancer rates have increased among black women and will be again the number one killer among the combined black population. The report states that this can be associated with the higher prevalence of smoking menthol cigarettes among the black population, which offer a less harsh feel of inhalation to the throat but are possibly more dangerous to the human body than a normal cigarette. In 2003, 27 percent of all cigarette sales were menthols, but around 70 percent of menthol cigarette sales go to blacks. ### "
0," Hemp seed oil, pressed from the seeds of the Cannabis sativa plant, has been named nature's perfect food due to its balanced concentrations of omega fatty acids. Hemp used to be consumed worldwide, as it was one of the first cultivated and consumed crops. There is a misconception that hemp contains THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant. Needless to say, this is false. Although relativity new to the Western Hemisphere, hemp seed oil is now widely available in health-food stores. Balance is key The seed of the hemp plant contains some of the most balanced and richest sources of oils on the planet. The ideal 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 is recommended by the World Health Organization for optimal utilization. The essential fatty acids in these oils are fundamental in restoring health and immune function. Hemp seed oil contains 80 percent essential fatty acids, the highest of any plant. Be sure to get your daily EFAs Hemp seed oil's exceptional concentrations of EFAs (essential fatty acids) are what make it so special. In concept, this oil could provide all of our EFA necessities for life. Essential fatty acids are the omega fats that cannot be produced by the body and must be ingested. They are known for their role in preventing heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis and much more. The seven-time Nobel Prize nominee, Dr. Johana Budwig, a pioneer of EFA research, reported success in treating heart infraction, arthritis, cancer, and other common diseases with massive doses of EFAs . Essential fatty acids are indispensable for the function and development of the brain and nervous system and the production of healthy cell membranes. They also supply hair and skin with necessary nutrients and aid in various other functions in the body. An alternative to fish oil Fish oil supplements are a great source of EFAs, particularly Omega 3s, which is why they have become so popular. However, for those who are vegetarian, they are not an option. There are also concerns that some sources of fish oil are contaminated with mercury and other toxins. Hemp seed oil, which contains Omega 3, 6, and 9, is a great alternative that will provide the same benefits as fish oil without the danger of ingesting toxins. Hemp seed oil for hair, skin, and nails Hair, skin, and nails are all formed from the same line of dermal cells, so it is no surprise that people who use hemp oil report thicker and shinier hair, softer skin, and stronger nails. Since hemp seed oil is nearly identical to our own lipids, it is capable of penetrating our cells and lubricating the surfaces between them. It is used to nourish not only dry skin but blotches and lesions as well. It can detoxify the skin and even out skin tone. You can safely use hemp oil as a skin moisturizer without worry of it clogging the pores. Eczema Of the many possible uses of hemp oil as a direct treatment, its efficacy at treating eczema is one of the most promising. Researchers, led by Dr. J. Callaway at the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Kuopio, Finland, studied the benefits of hemp seed oil on patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema) and reported the following results: 'We saw a remarkable reduction in dryness, itching and an overall improvement in symptoms.' Special properties of hemp oil: -Only plant containing vitamin D, which is necessary for calcium absorption -Contains vitamin E in advantageous amounts -Relives premenstrual stress -Has unequaled anti-inflammatory properties not found in other oils -Is a natural sunblock Second to none Hemp seed oil products are true superfoods that are brimming with greatness. When speaking of hemp seed oil Dr. Callaway also remarked, 'I'd have to conclude that this is probably the healthiest oil on the market.' "
0," Eating a diet high in walnuts may decrease cholesterol and fight inflammation, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, according to a study conducted by researchers from Harvard University and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . 'Consumption of nuts has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death,' the researchers wrote. 'Walnuts in particular have a unique profile: they are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may improve blood lipids and other cardiovascular disease risk factors.' Walnuts are also considered good dietary sources of fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin E and other antioxidants. Researchers analyzed the results of 13 different studies conducted on a total of 365 participants who had obtained between 10 and 24 percent of their calories from walnuts for four to 24 weeks. They found that participants on a high-walnut diet underwent significant decreases in total and LDL ('bad') cholesterol. 'When compared with control diets, diets supplemented with walnuts resulted in a significantly greater decrease in total cholesterol and in LDL-cholesterol concentrations,' the researchers wrote. The researchers also found other indicators that even though a high-walnut diet is high in fat, it seems to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease rather than raising it. 'Other results reported in the trials indicated that walnuts provided significant benefits for certain antioxidant capacity and inflammatory markers and had no adverse effects on body weight,' the researchers wrote. The researchers called for 'larger and longer-term trials' to further understand the heart benefits of nut-rich diets. Prior studies have linked diets high in nuts and berries to a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms related to cardiovascular disease. Other nuts previously linked to improved cardiovascular health include macadamia nuts and almonds. Diets high in walnuts may also reduce the risk of breast cancer, studies show.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Police in the British city of Plymouth have announced that affixing small digital cameras to the side of officers' helmets has drastically increased officers' ability to arrest and prosecute perpetrators of violent crime. During the first 10 weeks of the pilot project, arrests for violent crime in the test area increased by 85 percent. This includes a 40 percent increase in the detection of such crimes and a 20 percent increase in the arrest and prosecution of suspects. Police also noted an 8 percent drop in the incidence of violent crime in the test area. According to detective superintendent Richard Wood, head of a similar pilot program in London, the cameras' primary value is in making it easier for officers to prosecute those they observe committing crimes. 'Should anyone commit any offenses,' he said, 'the officers will instantly have the evidence to ... pursue criminal charges.' The small color cameras, similar in size to an AA battery are attached to the side of officers' helmets and record both audio and video footage of what is going on around them. The cameras being used in the London program, including a special utility belt to store the data, cost about 1,800 ($3,500) per officer. The Plymouth trial involves approximately 250 officers wearing the cameras for six months and is scheduled to finish in March. Some of the video footage gathered in the first 10 weeks has been released to the public and is available online. Both the Plymouth and London police departments hope to determine if the cameras would prove useful in other parts of the country. These new surveillance programs are part of a wider effort in the United Kingdom to monitor citizens more effectively. London police are also experimenting with automated license plate recognition software, increased patrol visibility and airport-style weapons searches. ### "
0," The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are so poorly written, vague and subjective that we all qualify for a variety of mental diagnoses, depending on the spin we use to describe our situation - or the spin in the mind of the one doing the diagnosis. In fact, many doctors absolutely qualify. Let's take a look at the official DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. There are five. You must have at least two of the five to qualify. At least one of the two must be among the first three. Symptoms must be experienced for at least a month before an official diagnosis can be secured. That's they way this game show works. This isn't a problem, as many doctors qualify on any given day. Here are the five stars of schizophrenia: 1. Delusions According to the DSM-5, a delusion is a false belief based on an incorrect inference about external reality that is held firmly in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. .. For example: The delusion that medication with disastrous side effects improves your health. The delusion that patients can be well served in 10 minutes or less. The delusion the doctor is under when he says. 'It's all in your head.' Or the one that doctors are God. 2. Hallucinations According to the DSM-5, a hallucination is a perception-like experience with the clarity and impact of a true perception... A doctor's primary hallucination is the patient. He thinks he is perceiving a patient with a set of symptoms. Then, he sees those symptoms in his mind and wants to attack them. What is actually in front of him is a person - a whole person with a life of his or her own, complete with a personal history, wants and dreams, emotions and relationships. The doc misses this reality in favor of his hallucinated patient and set of symptoms. 3. Disorganized speech or incoherence Ever heard a doc try to explain what is going on inside your body? You might blame your lack of understanding on a lack education in medical matters.The truth is, you are intelligent enough to understand your body.

0," He has billed himself as an unbiased arbiter of news and political events as he has hosted the Good Morning, America program for ABC News since leaving his post as the White House Communications Director and campaign advisor for President Bill Clinton. That alone would have once disqualified George Stephanopoulos from being seriously considered a 'journalist' in the normal sense of the word. Times have changed, however, and the legacy news media in America has long since become little more than a revolving door for political hacks on the left and right as they await their next position in a politically friendly administration. For his part, Stephanopoulos hasn't reentered the Democratic political world officially. Nevertheless, it has become more than obvious that he's been working as a Democratic political operative while masquerading as a journalist for ABC News with recent revelations that he has been donating large sums of money to the foundation of his former boss. In a mea culpa to viewers, Stephanopoulos 'admitted' his 'mistake' but tried to couch it as innocently as possible. Little of the money went to charity work 'I made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they're doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,' he said. 'I thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize.' As reported by Politico , Stephanopoulos -- who made donations of $25,000 to the Clinton Family Foundation in 2012, 2013 and 2014 -- 'never disclosed this information to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer last month about his book 'Clinton Cash,' which alleges that donations to the foundation may have influenced some of Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state.' As selfnews has reported and Schweizer has intimated, the foundation is really little more than a slush fund of nearly 200 corporate and foreign donors who were likely less interested in its charitable efforts than in access to a woman who could be the country's next president. If that sounds conspiratorial, consider the fact that of the hundreds of millions donated, just a small percentage of those funds are distributed to its charitable causes. According to the Foundation's own tax filings, just 10 percent of funding went to charities in 2013. Political slush fund As reported by The New York Post , the foundation's finances are so shady that it has been placed on a 'watch list' by a non-partisan organization, Charity Navigator, that monitors such groups after it was revealed that during 2013, the foundation took in $140 million but only spent $9 million on charitable activities. 'The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends,' the Post reported. As for Stephanopoulos' claims that his donations were specifically for 'global AIDS prevention and deforestation,' those don't hold water. There are plenty of organizations out there that he could have donated to directly that specifically deal with those issues. How could he possibly have known that the Clinton Foundation would have used his money directly for 'global AIDS prevention and deforestation?' 'It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,' Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group where progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout was once an organizing director, told the Post . The function of the Clinton Family Foundation and the nature of its operations and sources of donations -- especially the foreign sources -- became an issue recently as Hillary Clinton prepared to launch her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton had failed to disclose information regarding the donations and their sources while she served as secretary of state in the Obama administration, despite pledging to do so when she took the position .

0," New findings by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health reveal that X-rays can significantly increase children's risk of developing leukemia. Having even one X-ray, they say, can moderately increase the risk of developing certain kinds of leukemia, calling into question the overall safety of X-rays. Discovered as part of the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS), a population-based case-control study taking place in 35 counties in California, the findings shed new light on how continual exposure to even low-dose radiation can spur the development of harmful cancers. Previously, most experts just assumed that X-rays were fairly safe. 'The general clinical impression has been that the level of radiation a child would be exposed to today from a conventional X-rays would not confer an additional risk for cancer,' said Patricia Buffler, professor of epidemiology at UC Berkeley and principal investigator of the NCCLS. 'The results of our study were not what we expected.' According to scientific studies, humans are exposed to ionizing radiation -- the kind responsible for DNA mutations and cell damage -- all the time, including from natural sources like ground soil and the air itself. But the daily rate of environmental exposure to such ionizing radiation is roughly one-tenth of the amount emitted by a single X-ray, so it is much less threatening. Even worse, modern computed tomography (CT) scans emit hundreds of times more ionizing radiation than X-rays do, and many people receive CT scans all the time without any awareness of their dangers. 'If even plain film X-rays are associated with an increased risk of leukemia, then one has to wonder about CT scans, some of which can generate 500 times the dose of radiation of an X-ray,' commented Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UC San Francisco radiologist not associated with the study. According to Dr. Smith-Bindman, X-rays account for two-thirds of the imaging procedures children undergo. Twenty percent of their overall exposure to radiation comes from X-rays, while another ten percent comes from CT scans. Sources for this story include: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-...

0," It is already a known fact that individuals with darker skin pigmentation, including people of Middle Eastern and African descents, have a much more difficult time absorbing vitamin D-producing ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun than do individuals with lighter skin pigmentation. And a new study now confirms that a disproportionately high amount of primarily African-Americans die from cancer every year as a result of vitamin D deficiency. Published in the journal Dermato-Endocrinology , the study sheds a little more light on the vital role vitamin D plays in disease prevention. After taking into account socioeconomic status, stage of diagnosis, treatment options, and various other factors that might affect survival rates, researchers determined that the mortality rate for cancer among African-Americans is as much as 30 percent higher than it is for others, specifically because of vitamin D deficiency. Individuals with fair skin tones can produce an adequate amount of vitamin D from natural sunlight exposure in about 15 minutes a day during the summer. But blacks and other darker-skinned individuals require as much as six-times longer in the sun to produce the same amount, which means many darker-skinned people, especially in North America, are more prone to vitamin D deficiency than light-skinned people. As a result, individuals of African and Middle-Eastern descent may be more prone to chronic illness, including 13 specific types of cancer identified in the study -- bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, testicular, vaginal, Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma. This is why it is important for darker-skinned people to either spend more time in the sun, whenever possible, or supplement with natural vitamin D3 every day. 'Raising vitamin D concentrations to 40 ng (nanograms) per ml (milliliter) by taking 1000-4000 IU (international units) per day of vitamin D3 supplements is the easiest thing African-Americans can do to reduce the heavy burden of cancer they experience,' says William B. Grant, co-author of the new study and Director of the Sunlight, Nutrition and Health Research Center ( http://www.sunarc.org ). 'In addition to reducing the risk of cancer, vitamin D would also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory infections and many other chronic and infectious diseases.' Vitamin D deficiency widespread It is not just blacks that need more vitamin D, however. A 2011 study found that nearly half of the overall population is vitamin D deficient, regardless of race. The most severely affected groups, though, are blacks , more than 82 percent of which are said to be deficient, and Hispanics, more than 69 percent of which are vitamin D deficient. Opinions vary as to how much vitamin D an individual needs every day, but the growing consensus is that optimal blood serum levels of vitamin D are between 50-80 nanograms per milliliter ng/mL, or 125-200 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). Depending on what your current serum levels are, you may need to supplement daily with anywhere from 4,000-10,000 IU or more of vitamin D3. If you think you might be vitamin D deficient, you may want to get tested. The Vitamin D Council has created a helpful page that explains how to get tested, what to look for, and how to begin restoring optimal vitamin D levels in your body: http://www.vitamindcouncil.org "
0," New research looking at what appears to be a major contributor to male infertility, aluminum, has powerful implications for the safety of childhood vaccinations and flu shots, which are loaded with the toxic metal. Researchers from both the UK and France found that the higher the level of aluminum inside a male's body, the lower his overall sperm count and quality of semen. Published in the Elsevier journal Reproductive Toxicology , the groundbreaking study looked at semen samples collected from 62 male patients. In accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, semen analyses were conducted using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry method designed to assess aluminum concentration, and this was followed up with a cytological analysis using an aluminum-specific fluor, lumogallion. Going into the study, the researchers involved hypothesized that environmental pollutants like aluminum may be responsible for the steady decline in male fertility that has occurred primarily throughout the last 60 years in many industrialized nations. Focusing specifically on aluminum as a primary culprit, the team aimed to either confirm or dismiss a possible link between this common metal and sperm quality. Sure enough, their suspicions were confirmed. Aluminum, which can actually accumulate inside individual sperm cells, was found to be directly associated with damaged male fertility. Participants with oligospermia, a condition categorized by low concentrations of sperm, were found to have higher levels of detectable aluminum in their bodies, while those with low aluminum content had higher concentrations of healthy sperm. Among all the 62 donors, mean aluminum content was found to be generally high, averaging 339 parts per billion (ppb). However, some of the donors had exceptionally high aluminum levels in excess of 500 ppb, and these donors also had the worst quality and quantity of sperm overall, illustrating an exceptional inverse relationship between the two. 'There has been a significant decline in male fertility, including sperm count, throughout the developed world over the past several decades and previous research has linked this to environmental factors such as endocrine disruptors,' said Professor Christopher Exley, a leading authority on human exposure to aluminum at Keele University in the UK and leader of the study. 'Human exposure to [aluminum] has increased significantly over the same time period and our observation of significant contamination of male semen by [aluminum] must implicate [aluminum] as a potential contributor to these changes in reproductive fertility.' Watch out, parents: Childhood vaccines, flu shots all contain aluminum adjuvants These findings are an obvious cause for concern among parents, as many childhood vaccines are loaded with aluminum . According to the National Network for Immunization Information, the following vaccines are currently licensed to contain aluminum adjuvants, which include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and potassium aluminum sulfate, also called 'alum': "
0," I've got something in common with Donald Trump. As the editor of selfnews, people tell me all the time, 'Why don't you do a story about (fill in the blank) and expose it?' My answer is usually, 'Why don't you start your own website and write about it yourself, and we'll publicize your story?' The answer is almost always the same. 'Oh, I couldn't do that, I'd get fired from my job' (or audited by the IRS, or shut down by the FDA, etc). They always have a reason why they can't say the things they really believe... while simultaneously wanting me to say those things for them. Americans right now see Donald Trump in exactly the same way. He's the village hero they're arming with a sword while shoving him forward to face the oncoming dragon. Trump, you see, has guts. He's a warrior. He's willing to march into all the battles that everyone else desperately wants to avoid. Most people, you see, live with an astonishing lack of personal fortitude . They're easily intimidated and often find it easier to go along and get along rather than rock the boat by challenging the status quo. They're afraid to go against the grain, speak the truth in a crowded room or express an obvious fact that isn't politically correct. (Like the simple fact that vaccines damage children or that chemotherapy kills cancer patients.) But individuals like Donald Trump and the Health Ranger (that's me) have a reputation for kicking ass, speaking out and fighting for truth, even in the face of organized, systemic suppression of that truth. Because of that, people often call on us to speak up for them and say the things they are too afraid to say themselves . That's why I deeply understand why Donald Trump is so popular: He's the warrior who's willing to take on the establishment that everybody knows is crooked and corrupt . Trump is willing to say the words of truth that everybody else already believes but is too afraid to utter. 'Build a wall! Kick out the illegals!' Everybody's thinking it -- especially African-Americans who are losing their jobs due to illegals -- but few are willing to say it for fear of being publicly condemned. Donald Trump is America's surrogate mouthpiece When Donald Trump announces that politicians are stupid, the media is lying and the government is incompetent, he's speaking for all Americans who have noticed precisely the same thing. Secretly, the American people know Trump is telling the truth , even if they wouldn't dare acknowledge that in their social group or in a media interview. To maintain social conformity, people have to publicly say ridiculous things like, 'The government cares about people.' But privately, they know that's complete nonsense. And here's why this matters: Voting is anonymous. It's private. Nobody knows how you voted in an election unless you tell them . This means people can say one thing publicly while voting in precisely the opposite way at the voting booths. That's why I predict that if the 2016 election comes down to Clinton vs. Trump, Donald Trump will win in a landslide . It may never come to that, of course. I'm not sure Hillary Clinton can survive her runaway criminality and the fact that nearly all informed Americans simply don't trust her. I'm also not entirely sure that Donald Trump will become the Republican nominee, either. The idiotic GOP establishment, predictably, is trying to destroy Trump to make sure their own favorite nominee -- Jeb Bush -- gets crowned King. But if it come down to Clinton vs. Trump, I have no doubt Trump would win in a landslide for the simple reason that most people privately agree with him .

0," While there has been a lot of research both in favor and against one of America's favorite drinks, this latest bit of research leaves you feeling a little less guilty after having that second, or third, or even fourth cup of coffee. The results of a new study suggest that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day may reduce your risk of developing cancer of the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, according to researchers. Published in the February issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention , scientists found that drinking roughly 26 to 37 ounces of coffee per day reduced endometrial cancer by up to 18 percent. 'We were not surprised by the results that a high versus low intake of coffee was associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer, because they were consistent with what has been observed in previous studies,' said study author Melissa Merritt, who is also a research fellow in cancer epidemiology at Imperial College London in England. Study: Women who drank about four cups of coffee per day were less likely to develop cancer of the endometrium, compared with those who consumed less than one cup a day Researchers reached their results using data on nearly half a million women from two large ongoing studies and studying the dietary habits of more than 2,800 women with cancer of the endometrium. 'We used similar methods to investigate the association between coffee intake and endometrial cancer as previous studies,' said Merritt. 'This is important so we can compare results across different studies.' During the study, researches found that one trial, which included drinking 37 ounces of coffee a day, reduced endometrial cancer risk by 18 percent. Another trial involving consumption of 26 ounces per day identified a similar reduction, reports CBS News . After evaluating 84 foods and nutrients, Merritt's team found that, 'For most other dietary factors, there was no consistent association with endometrial cancer risk.' It's important to note that, while researchers did identify a link, they did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of endometrial cancer. Scientists also did not differentiate between drinking decaf or regular coffee; therefore, Merritt said she couldn't comment on which one is better. Dr. Robert Morgan, a professor of medical oncology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the new study is 'validating other studies showing coffee has a beneficial effect in decreasing endometrial cancer .' Antioxidants found in coffee may prevent or slow cell damage While researchers aren't entirely sure why coffee may help lower the risk of endometrial cancer, Merritt suggests that one reason might be because coffee reduces estrogen levels in the body, changing the balance of hormones. The risk of endometrial cancer increases when the balance between estrogen and progesterone shifts and leans more towards estrogen, according to the American Cancer Society. Being overweight, beginning menstruation earlier than normal and late menopause may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Other risk factors include having an inherited form of colorectal cancer, never being pregnant or being infertile, and using tamoxifen to prevent or treat breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a hormone therapy drug that blocks the actions of estrogen. Endometrial cancer claims more than 10,000 lives each year in the United States In the U.S., cancer of the endometrium is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs, according to Cancer.org . Roughly 54,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed this year, with more than 10,000 of them likely to be fatal. This type of cancer is more common among women over 45 years old, with about three out of four cases being diagnosed in women ages 55 and older.

0," Memorizing board certification test questions and relaying them to other doctors soon to take the test themselves has become common practice among radiology doctors seeking to become board certified. But the American Board of Radiology (ABR), as well as a number of educational institutions, are cracking down on this practice, known as 'recalls,' after escalating concerns about how this form of cheating could ruin the integrity of the board certification process. CNN reports that Dr. Matthew Webb, an Army captain who was trained at the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium (SAUSHEC), recently filed a complaint with ABR about the widespread use of recalls. Dr. Webb told the group that cheating had become so commonplace that even the program director of the radiology department where Dr. Webb studied had basically ordered him to use recalls in order to pass the test. 'We're outraged by this, and we took this case to our professionalism committee,' said Dr. Gary Becker, executive director of ABR and overseer of the exam certification process, to CNN in response to Dr. Webb's complaint. While ABR's response has included cracking down on the use of recalls and reformatting the exam process beginning next year, Dr. Becker claims the use of recalls is not a health threat to patients since radiologists still must go through extensive training, and pass the rigorous test itself, in order to become certified. Dr. Webb, on the other hand, says using recalls is the 'ultimate betrayal of trust to patients,' and the 'most egregious and flagrant violation in academia.' He told reporters that students in any other phase of schooling -- elementary school, high school, undergraduate studies, and graduate studies -- would not be allowed to get away with cheating , so why should radiologists? Many other practicing radiologists, on the other hand, liken recalls to simple study guides that aid in the learning process. Since 50 percent of board certification exam questions change from year to year, and the fact that doctors must still successfully pass an unrehearsed oral exam, using recalls is just a practical way to study intense material, they say. 'If they had a test where you could study relevant radiology knowledge and they tested on it, that would be fine,' said Dr. Joseph Deiber, a radiologist, to CNN. Dr. Dieber believes recalls are a 'gray area,' and says many of the questions on the board certification exam are 'irrelevant to the modern practice of radiology,' which is why recalls are widely used as study guides.

0," As the European Union considers whether to lift restrictions on three pesticides in the neonicotinoid family, it would do well to consider the phenomenon, known to Canadian beekeepers, in which bees start dying in droves shortly after corn planting season. 'Once the corn started to get planted our bees died by the millions,' said beekeeper Dave Schuit in summer 2013, as reported by Eat Local Grown . That spring, Schuit lost 600 hives containing 37 million bees. The same year, Canadian farmer Gary Kenny said that eight of the 10 beehives that he kept on his property died shortly after his neighbors planted corn in their fields. Genetically modified (GM) corn is widely planted in Canada , but because the bee deaths occurred just after planting, the corn plants are not likely to blame for this particular die-off. Instead, beekeepers believe the cause is that the corn seeds were pre-treated with neonicotinoids. Air seeding causes neonicotinoid dust to fly off the seeds and into the air, drifting across the landscape. Numerous studies point finger at neonics In one study, researchers from American Purdue University examined the bees that died or were dying as part of the spring 2013 die-off. 'Bees exhibited neurotoxic symptoms, analysis of dead bees revealed traces of [the neonicotinoids] thiamethoxam/clothianidin in each case,' they wrote. 'Seed treatments of field crops (primarily corn) are the only major source of these compounds.' A local Pest Management Regulatory Agency investigation also pointed to the same cause, concluding that corn seeds treated with those neonicotinoids 'contributed to the majority of bee mortalities.' 'The air seeders are the problem,' said Paul Wettlaufer, a local farmer and director of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. Neonicotinoids are 'systemic pesticides.' They are applied to the seeds prior to planting, and then taken up into every tissue of the plant, including leaves, seeds, pollen, flowers and nectar. This makes them highly lethal not just to agricultural pests, but to all insects, and even birds that visit the plants for any reason. 'Large scale prophylaxic use [of neonicotinoids] in agriculture, their high persistence in soil and water, and their uptake by plants and translocation to flowers ... put pollinator services at risk,' concluded one international research study. Not only pollinators are threatened. Two major studies in 2015 found that the pesticides have widespread, dangerous effects on entire ecosystems. One, published in the journal Nature , found that neonicotinoid use was causing bird populations to crash. This is likely caused by both direct poisoning and by devastation of their invertebrate food sources. Meanwhile, an analysis by the the Task Force on Systemic Pesticides, of 800 separate studies, concluded that even when used according to manufacturer guidelines, neonicotinoids wreak havoc on 'non-target' species such as earthworms, insects, aquatic invertebrates and even lizards and fish. The pesticides are 'likely to have a wide range of negative biological and ecological impacts,' the task force wrote. The growing case for a ban In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) placed a two-year ban on the use of three neonicotinoids, citing a likely risk to bees. The EFSA has now launched a new study to review that policy, with results expected in January 2017. Yet the evidence for a ban on neonicotinoids is even stronger now than it was two years ago. Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been forced to admit that the chemicals devastate pollinators. The agency recently announced the findings of field trials, finding that even very low level use of neonicotinoids (25 parts per billion in plant pollen and nectar), caused measurable drops in populations of honeybee hives. Researchers believe that neonicotinoids damage bee brains, specifically the ability to process information related to orientation and direction. "
0," Russia has now officially banned all imports of genetically modified corn, citing concerns from a recent study by French researchers showing rats grew massive cancer tumors when fed a lifetime of Monsanto's genetically modified corn. Russia's consumer protection group, Rospotrebnadzor , said it was halting all imports of GM corn while the country's Institute of Nutrition will be evaluating the results of the study. The Russian ban is the latest blow to Monsanto, a company desperately clinging to the myth that its genetically modified crops are 'no different' than traditional crops and therefore long-term safety testing is completely unnecessary. Monsanto has assaulted the French study, claiming it did not use enough rats and that the duration of the study was too short -- an absurd claim, given that Monsanto's own studies on animals are only 90 days in duration, while the French study looked at the effects of rats eating GM corn (and drinking trace levels of Roundup herbicide) for two years. Notably, the large cancer tumors did not begin to appear until after the rats reached adulthood. Monsanto's GM corn has been in the U.S. food supply for more than a decade, and its corn is found in many popular breakfast cereals . A European ban, too? In addition to the Russian ban, Monsanto may also soon be facing a European ban . France is reported asking for a European-wide ban on GM corn if its national health agency confirms the findings of French scientists. On top of that, if Proposition 37 passes in California, food producers will be required to label GMO on foods sold in that state. This is widely expected to cause U.S. food producers to abandon to use of GMO in foods, since virtually all consumers who know anything about GMO would refuse to buy items labeled as containing genetically engineered ingredients. Toxicity of GMO now scientifically established CRIIGEN.org has issued a statement summarizing its findings of the recent rat study, saying: The implications are extremely serious. They demonstrate the toxicity, both of a GMO with the most widely spread transgenic character and of the most widely used herbicide, even when ingested at extremely low levels, (corresponding to those found in surface or tap water). In addition, these results call into question the adequacy of the current regulatory process, used throughout the world by agencies involved in the assessment of health, food and chemicals, and industries seeking commercialization of products. Here's one of the photos released by researchers in the recent study, demonstrating the massive cancer tumors found in rats who were fed GM corn : Government regulators have been infiltrated by Monsanto; scientists bought off In truth, Monsanto has managed to influence food regulators all around the world. It has paid money to numerous scientists in the USA, and it has essentially 'placed' GMO-pushing individuals such as Michael Taylor into influential positions in government. The European Union's Food Safety Agency (FSA) is also staffed by decision makers with financial ties to genetic engineering seed companies. Rep. Dennis Kucinich has called for a national GMO labeling law . He says: 'The FDA has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labeling of GMOs. Ninety percent of Americans agree. So, why no labeling? I'll give you one reason: The influence and the corruption of the political process by Monsanto . Monsanto has been a prime mover in GMO technology, a multi-million dollar GMO lobby here and a major political contributor.'

0," Tremendous success this past spring of the Internet-streamed docu-series The Quest for the Cure has led organizers of that event to create and host a brand-new docu-series that will feature more experts discussing a range of natural cures for cancer. The pre-launch of the new series begins September 29 and runs through October 12. The actual docu-series will stream on the Internet from Oct. 13 through Oct. 24. One of the featured experts will be Dr. Ben Johnson, who is the only medical doctor to appear in the hit movie The Secret and is a very accomplished physician with three medical degrees (M.D., N.M.D., and D.O.). Dr. Johnson became intensely interested in alternative medicines after he managed to reverse the effects of Lou Gehrig's disease using unconventional medical techniques, according to his website. During a medical career that has now spanned more than 30 years, Dr. Johnson began with graduate work in immunopathology in 1976. Since then, he has come to focus primarily on writing and speaking about staying healthy, especially for women in terms of breast health. Sign up now for the 'The Quest for the Cure...Continues' by clicking here. In 1997, Dr. Johnson started formally combining conventional and 'complementary medicine' when treating patients. He moved back to his home state of Georgia where he then founded a complimentary/alternative cancer treatment center in Atlanta called the Immune Recovery Foundation. In 2004, he turned to breast cancer research and began focusing on breast health education, then established the International Cancer Foundation in Rossville, Georgia. 'Dr. Ben,' as he is more affectionately known, has successfully treated thousands of women. Indeed, healthcare pros from around the world have sought his medical advice. In 2003, Dr. Johnson was himself diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. After losing hope in both conventional and alternative medical treatments, he met Alex Loyd, creator of the patented and trademarked 'Healing Codes.' Dr. Johnson's subsequent work with Loyd's procedures -- which address the core emotional/energy issues that control every aspect of our lives -- through which he found relief from the 'incurable' symptoms of ALS, led to his appearance in the best-selling 2006 documentary The Secret , as well as the co-authoring of the bestselling books The Healing Code , and The Secret of Health: Breast Wisdom . Dr. Johnson is the proprietor of Dr. Ben Johnson Services LLC, a business that promotes natural healthcare products, in addition to breast cancer screening for women. 'Always looking for more ways to spread his message of health and wholeness,' his website states, Dr. Johnson wrote and published Healing Waters in June 2011, and followed that up in 2012 with a report on thermography and the health problems associated with mammography.

0," Left-wing activists demanding 'social justice' have managed to convince policymakers up and down the West Coast to adopt regulations forcing local shops and businesses to pay their low-skilled workers an inordinately high minimum wage -- one that is nearly double the federal minimum wage. And now, predictably, many of those shops are becoming casualties of this economic terrorism. One of them is a beloved bookstore that had been in business nearly two decades. But there will be others. As reported by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) on its website, residents of San Francisco voted to increase the minimum wage in the city to $15 an hour by 2018, requiring shops and businesses to pay low-skilled and younger workers without experience an outsized wage that is usually reserved for more-experienced, better-trained employees. As such, Borderlands Books has become one of the first San Francisco businesses to close as a result of the policy, because its owners simply cannot afford the higher mandated wage. Artificially higher wages costs jobs 'Borderlands is closing,' the bookstore announced in recent days . 'In 18 years of business, Borderlands has faced a number of challenges. The first and clearest was in 2000, when our landlord increased our rent by 100% and we had to move to our current location on Valencia Street. All of the subsequent ones have been less clear-cut but more difficult. The steady movement towards online shopping, mostly with Amazon, has taken a steady toll on bookstores throughout the world and Borderlands was no exception. After that and related to it, has been the shift towards ebooks and electronic reading devices. And finally the Great Recession of 2009 hit us very hard, especially since we had just opened a new aspect to the business in the form of our cafe. 'But, through all those challenges, we've managed to find a way forward and 2014 was the best year we've ever had.' Until, in November, voters passed the ordinance requiring the higher minimum wage . And while Borderlands Books said it 'support[s] the concept of a living wage,' the store simply cannot operate if it must pay employees that much because it cannot make a profit. As Charles Platt at AEI noted: Bottom Line: Over several decades, Borderlands Books was able to survive a 100% rent increase, the effects of the Great Recession, and competition from Amazon, ebooks and electronic reading devices. But they won't be able to survive the voter-endorsed minimum wage law government-mandated wage floor that guarantees bookstores in the city will be forced to close down. And Borderlands Books is probably not an isolated case -- many of the other book stores in San Francisco will likely face the same fate. In other words, the economic lesson here is 'minimum wage, maximum sorrow' for San Francisco book stores. Businesses face stark choices - and labor loses The predictions for fewer overall jobs -- employment lost specifically because of a higher government-mandated wage -- is not a partisan endeavor. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office published a report a year ago stating that a federal minimum wage hike to just $10.10 an hour would result in a loss of a half-million jobs. The same report estimated that a wage at that level could lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty. Technically, that's true; at 40 hours per week and before taxes, insurance and other deductions, $10.10 an hour is just over $21,000 per year; according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal poverty level for 2015, for a family of two, is $15,930, and for a family of four, it is $24,250. But when you add in the employer mandate from Obamacare, which is having a negative effect on employment, as tracked by by Investors Business Daily , many low-wage employees are having their hours cut and aren't working that many per week. As noted by The Washington Free Beacon , businesses forced to pay more for labor than the labor is worth face three choices: reduce the workforce (through layoffs and automation), increase the price of goods to compensate for the additional labor costs, or both.

0," Although the cosmetic industry would have us believe otherwise, beautiful skin doesn't come from a jar full of perfumed chemicals. Beyond being born with great genes, the best thing you can do for your skin is to eat a healthy diet. Learn how to enhance your skin from the inside out by eating foods that will make your epidermis glow with health. Try adding these foods to your diet to both feel and look better. Chia Seeds: Chia offers a multitude of health benefits. The word chia derives from the Aztec word for oily. Chia seeds offer high levels of omega-3 acids which the human body needs but cannot produce and which only come from a few dietary sources. Without omega-3's, people can suffer from poor circulation and dry skin, as well as heart problems, fatigue, depression and a feeling of mental fogginess. Chia seeds help keep skin (and the rest of the body) hydrated because they are hydrophilic, absorbing more than 10 times their weight in water. You can sprinkle chia seeds in your hot cereal, add a teaspoon of the tiny seeds to a glass of juice, or add a few to add extra texture to a salad or vegetable hot dish. Almonds: These nuts are an excellent source of vitamin E which helps minimize the negative effects of sun exposure on the skin, as well as aiding against certain types of skin cancer. They also provide a quick source of strength and energy, providing fuel for exercise which also benefits the skin. Additionally, almond skins benefit human skin through their high levels of antioxidants. Dandelions: If you look at dandelions as annoying weeds, you are missing out on a tremendous healthy food. Dandelions cleanse the liver of toxins. If you have a congested liver which cannot effectively cleanse the bloodstream, your skin is more likely to show wear and tear whether through breakouts or the effects of aging and pollution. Dandelion greens contain high levels of several of the vitamins and minerals known to contribute to healthy skin including Vitamin A, B, and C as well as copper and zinc. Think of dandelions as the dietary equivalent of a refreshing face mask. Dandelions can easily be grown or foraged, so you can add them to your diet without adding to your grocery budget. Spring and early summer are the best times to harvest the greens. You can use them in salads or juice them. In early fall, gather dandelion roots which you can chop and dry-roast in the oven, then use to make a rich, chicory-like beverage. You can add honey plus coconut or rice milk for a dandelion latte. Just be sure not to use dandelions which have been sprayed with chemicals. Cucumbers: These vegetables provide abundant vitamin C and silica. The trace mineral silica is essential for strong connective tissue and supports the ability of skin to heal. Without silica, skin loses its elasticity and becomes more prone to wrinkles and age spots. Turmeric: The spice which gives curries an orangey hue derives much of its nutritional value from polyphenol anti-oxidant phytochemicals called curcuminoids. Curcuminoids provide as much as 8 times the antioxidant power as that found in most other antioxidant foods . Turmeric aids in the treatment of psoarisis, rosacea, acne and other inflammatory skin conditions. Plus, turmeric contributes to skin elasticity. It also helps to support the natural flora which can provide form a barrier on the skin skin protecting it from dangerous microbes.

0," The makings of a mass-level extinction event in the world's oceans appear disturbingly imminent, as marine species after marine species washes ashore on the Pacific West Coast. Ailing seals, dead fish, missing pelicans and much more are being reported in the media as scientists struggle to figure out what, exactly, is causing entire marine ecosystems to suffer and die, seemingly inexplicably. Much of the carnage is being reported in California, where baby sea lions in distress have been washing ashore in record numbers. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports that, for the second year in a row, more baby sea lions than ever are having trouble surviving after being abandoned by their mothers, the direct result of a lack of food. According to reports, a record 367 California sea lions were admitted to the Marine Mammal Center near San Francisco between January and May, which is nearly five times the normal average. In Southern California, more than 600 sea lions, or twice the normal average, have been taken in so far this year. This is on top of the 1,600 that were treated last year. 'Sea lions are living and feeding on the same resource[s] as humans are,' stated Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary science at the Marine Mammal Center, to WSJ. 'If they are starting to have problems, that shows there could be a problem with the ocean.' A little further north, orcas and beluga whales are suffering similar fates. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says widespread pollution from oil and gas drilling has caused populations of both species to dwindle significantly throughout the past several decades. Also suffering along the Alaskan coast are Alaskan ice seals, more than 250 of which have developed a mystery disease that often results in death. Experts have postulated that toxic algal growth along coastal waters may be to blame, and this a result of excess sun exposure due to continued ozone depletion. 'In all, the federal government has declared 38 'unusual mortality events' involving marine mammal species since 2003,' wrote Jim Carlton for WSJ. 'That is nearly twice the number of events recorded from 1991--when the animals were put under greater federal protection--to 2002.' Over on the other side of the country, hundreds of manatees and about 80 bottlenose dolphins were discovered stranded in Florida's Indian River Lagoon between 2012 and 2013. And in South Carolina in 2013, as many as 40,000 menhaden fish , which measure between six and eight inches in length, washed up dead between DeBordieu Beach and Pawleys Island, just one week after thousands of the same type of fish washed up along North Carolina's Masonboro Island. One year prior, thousands of dead starfish washed up along the same beaches. Back in California, changing weather patterns that some scientists are attributing to the weather phenomenon known as El Nino are causing fish and whales to appear in unusual places. The first ever yellowfin tuna fish was recently caught in San Diego, as well as the first dorado Mahi Mahi fish. These fish types typically do not appear in San Diego. 'We've already started to see very unusual fish catches here,' stated Tim Barnett, a marine research emeritus with the San Diego-based Scripps Institute of Oceanography, to KPBS. 'The first yellowfin tuna was caught in May--that has never happened before to anybody's recollection. 'And the other thing too is the first dorado (mahi-mahi)--first of June. That has never happened before. They really like the warm water and you normally don't see them here until September.' Ocean mortality events mark beginning of possible global extinction Since these types of fish don't normally live in the colder waters off the coast of California, their fate is basically already sealed like the rest of the dead animals that have previously been discovered. Add to this the millions upon millions of dead sea stars being identified up and down the Pacific West Coast and the world has a real problem on its hands. 'It's the largest mortality event for marine diseases we've seen,' added Drew Harvell, a marine epidemiologist at Cornell University, to KUOW News about the phenomenon. 'It affects over twenty species on our coast and it's been causing catastrophic mortality. ... My expectation is that within the next month all of the stars will die.' Whether it's radiation from Fukushima, residual oil and chemical pollution from the BP oil spill in the Gulf, changing weather patterns, or some combination of all three, one thing is for sure -- the world's oceans are sick. And based on the way things are going, a global extinction event of epic proportions seems like less a matter of if , and more a matter of when . "
0," As the rapid devaluation of the American dollar rapidly approaches, more and more people are looking for a safe place to store their savings. In previous articles, I've talked about the importance of putting some percentage of your savings in gold and silver coins (that amount varies from 10% to 50%, depending on who you ask). These discussions got the attention of Peter Ragnar from Roaring Lion Publishing ( www.RoaringLionPublishing.com ). Peter is a remarkable author, speaker and anti-aging guru. His age is unknown, and he operates at a level of self mastery that few people ever achieve, and if you ever get the chance to talk with him in person or over the phone, you'll agree that there's something extraordinary about this individual that transcends the typical experience or a human being (or any being, for that matter). I've followed Peter's work for several years and have come to greatly admire his expertise on wild foods, anti-aging, physical strength and many other topics, all of which he teaches through his books on his website ( www.RoaringLionPublishing.com ) When I learned that Peter had founded a gold minting company, I was at first very surprised. But then it made sense: Peter's into longevity, and if you're going to be around for a long time, you want to make sure you can live with a sense of abundance, surrounded by valuable metals from Mother Earth, always attracting new wealth for as long as you live. That's the philosophy of Golden Lion Mint: Abundance, not fear. The company has founded is called Golden Lion Mint ( www.GoldenLionMint.com ), and it's based on a solid financial philosophy of safety that you can find here: http://www.goldenlionmint.com/GLM/pyramid.ht... Through Golden Lion Mint, you can buy gold and silver bullion bars that are minted with the special symbols of abundance and protection selected by Peter. It costs roughly 14% - 15% over the 'spot' price for gold, but here's why it makes a whole lot of sense to get gold and silver bars and rounds through Golden Lion Mint: The gold and silver you buy is yours to keep. You're not buying a 'certificate' of gold, you're buying real, physical gold that's as pure as you can get on the commodities market. (Four nines for the gold, three nines for the silver.) Your purchase is private! Golden Lion Mint never asks for your social security number, and they don't keep your credit card number or other information you want to keep private. Whatever you purchase from Golden Lion Mint is YOUR secret, and nobody else (not even any government) knows that you own and possess these precious metals. They've just begun offering gold and silver rounds, which are like coins, but since they're not official U.S. coins, they aren't considered to be in 'circulation,' meaning they are not subject to confiscation! That makes these gold and silver rounds in many ways safer than buying official U.S. gold and silver coins. Plus, the price on these rounds is far better than the high prices currently demanded for Treasury-minted gold and silver coins. You pay no sales tax to buy this gold or silver (unless you live in North Carolina, in which case you pay state sales tax). This can save you a lot of money compared to buying precious metals locally. Buying gold and silver from Golden Lion Mint is a much better deal than buying official gold and silver coins right now. The price of the coins has been substantially inflated due to rising demand, making these privately-minded bars and coins a much better value in terms of how much metal you get for your dollar. Golden Lion Mint is focused on abundance and prosperity, not fear and panic. The gold you get from these folks is patterned with the vibration of attracting new wealth and prospering during all times (tough times, good times, etc.). You'll get this sense the minute you talk with Tony, who loves to talk to all prospective customers. In fact, just call 828-350-1454 if you want to speak with him now. Peter Ragnar, Tony and myself are all dedicated to helping you protect your savings and prosper during tough economic times. We want you to be healthy, wealthy, happy and abundant, even if strange things happen to paper currencies. We are all serving the greater good, and you'll instantly feel a great sense of comfort with the intentions and vibrations of the people at Golden Lion Mint. Just so you know, I have no financial affiliation with Golden Lion Mint at all. I earn nothing from any business you may conduct with the company, and I offer this article solely as a service to my readers. If you contact them, however, I would appreciate you mentioning the Health Ranger or selfnews just as a matter of courtesy, so they know where you heard about them. You're likely to get really good service by mentioning you're a selfnews reader, since Peter's team greatly admires the selfnews community, too! So how much should you invest in previous metals? That's something that only you and your financial advisor can decide. Two months ago I was recommending that people convert about 15% of their savings to precious metals. In my personal opinion, that should now be raised to around 25%, but opinions vary widely. Gold could still go down in the short term (as many investments have), but I can tell you one thing: You certainly don't want to be left holding worthless paper dollars on the day the U.S. Treasury announces it will default on its debt by abandoning the dollar. That's not guaranteed to happen, of course: We may just see a wild hyperinflation of the dollar as the effect of the $8+ trillion in new money created by the Federal Reserve kicks in. In any case, gold is the safe haven of savings. It always has been. Many financial observers believe gold is headed to $2,000 or $3,000 an ounce. You'll have to decide what you believe is right, but in my view, I see investment in precious metals as a crucial strategy for protecting your savings from the erosion of currencies all around the world while also establishing a pattern of wealth and abundance attraction for yourself. Remember: Gold is a powerful magnet for wealth. It's made by Mother Nature, mined out of the Earth, and it has properties that were considered magical by ancient civilizations (and many people living today). There's a lot more to gold than just saving money... Learn more at www.GoldenLionMint.com or call 828-350-1454. I give Golden Lion Mint my personal endorsement and recommendation. These are honest, high-integrity, high-vibration folks you'll be dealing with, and I trust them completely. I recommend you give Tony a call and see how you can start accumulating real, physical gold and silver through Golden Lion Mint. DISCLAIMER: ALL INVESTMENTS INVOLVE SOME RISK.

0," A video compilation of the recently held mock mass shooting event near the University of Texas-Austin campus, aimed at highlighting how 'gun-free zones' lead to more mass murder and make people less safe, has been posted online . The video, which is edited and set to music, begins with a Fox News interview of one of the event's organizers, Matthew Short of Come and Take It Texas , a gun-rights group , explaining the purpose of the protest. 'The point is to show that 95 percent of mass shootings actually happen in gun free zones, and we would like to end gun-free zones in America,' he said. 'There is an inalienable right to bear arms, which is in the defense of our persons and our property and our families.' The video compilation, which was produced by TalkNetwork.com the new online talk radio network documents the event from start to finish, and includes footage of some of the antics of anti-Second Amendment counter-protestors, some of whom were carrying dildos and fart noisemakers. One of the things the video documents is the fact that coverage of the actual mock shooting event was scooped by TalkNetwork, as the mainstream media was unable to locate the mock shooting before it took place. That alone demonstrated that widespread gun-free zones mean shootings can and do take place where they are often least expected or anticipated. Easily distracted media missed much of the actual event As selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and co-founder of TalkNetwork.com , reported : Mirroring the strategy of terrorists and psychotic shooters who strike at random times and places, the Don't Comply gun rights activists unleashed the mock mass shooting several blocks away from the clueless mainstream media, whose easily-distracted reporters spent their time filming 'fart protesters' and leftist lunatics waving dildos while claiming the Don't Comply group's freedom of expression was 'insensitive.' 'Here's the thing people,' Short said of the mainstream media, 'the first 'murder' happened while the press was distracted talking to people about their feelings, while they were talking about their opinions and how they didn't want guns in their zone. The media was completely duped and distracted while the people who were perpetrating the crime got away, and went to another place and committed mass murder. 'This can only be stopped by being able to arm yourself with your Second Amendment rights,' Short continued. 'The police didn't get here until it had already been done, although there were people watching it happen.' Much to see and learn Here are some other highlights from the video and the event: -- Many anti-gun protestors showed up and waived dildos; others used fart noises and chanted, 'We FART in your direction!' -- One man approached Adams as he filmed and reported and claimed that he was frightened of him because he is white. 'In other words, this guy is an admitted racist,' Adams wrote. 'Can you imagine the outrage if I had walked up to a black person and said the same thing to them?' -- Many anti-gun demonstrators showed up wearing communist symbols. -- One anti-gun protestor, a woman, waived a dildo and said if ISIS operatives showed up to do carnage on the UT campus, she would disarm them with a call for peace (good luck with that , lady, and be sure to have your will finalized first). -- Many gun rights advocates carried American flags and spoke respectfully to some in the mainstream media. -- Others showed up to the event with open carry of loaded weapons, to demonstrate what it is actually like to take responsibility for your own protection and self-defense. -- As Adams noted, 'Austin PD cops were awesome. I spent many minutes chatting with them and they were all relaxed, professional and observing without interfering.' Check out the entire video montage here . Sources: selfnews.com YouTube.com "
0," Honey, often referred to as ' liquid gold ,' houses a wide range of vitamins and minerals. It is a natural and healthier alternative to sugar to sweeten things up. It kills bacteria, viruses and fungi. It also lowers cholesterol and inflammation. However, to reap all of honey's benefits, you should always buy local and organic , which comes from bees rather than from a factory. According to Food Safety News , more than 75 percent of honey sold in U.S. grocery stores isn't actually the same thing honey bees produce. They sent over 60 different jars bought in 10 states and the District of Columbia to premier melissopalynologist and professor at Texas A&M; University, Vaughn Bryant. They found the market to be flooded with fake Indian or Chinese honey which is banned in Europe for safety reasons. It is often contaminated with antibiotics or heavy metals , and doesn't contain any trace of pollen. 'Any product that's been ultra-filtered and no longer contains pollen isn't honey,' states the FDA. However, nothing seems to be done about it, and fake, processed honey is still sold in grocery stores all over the U.S. Ultra-filtered honey In the normal honey-making process, honey is filtered to remove contaminants, such as bee parts, waxes and other impurities. Nothing wrong there; nobody wants to chew on bee parts or wax, right? Ultra-filtration, a technique refined by the Chinese, is a high-tech procedure in which honey is heated and pushed through extremely fine filters at high pressure. This technique not only removes contaminants, but pushes out the pollen and many other beneficial vitamins, minerals and enzymes, too. Why would a company go through all these expensive filtration steps to end up with an inferior product, ripped of all its nutrients? 'Removal of all pollen from honey 'makes no sense' and is completely contrary to marketing the highest quality product possible,' Mark Jensen, president of the American Honey Producers Association, told Food Safety News . Honey laundering China is known to produce cheap honey diluted with inexpensive sweeteners such as high-fructose corn syrup . Many countries have banned Chinese honey, as it is all too often contaminated with antibiotics and heavy metals. After a few big scandals, the U.S. decided to pose higher taxes on Chinese honey to push U.S. companies to buy real, locally produced honey. But there is no stopping it. Chinese honey producers now launder their cheap, fake honey to another country, before shipping it to the U.S. In doing so, they avoid the higher import taxes, making it still cheaper than honey produced in the U.S. To cover up this dirty honey laundering secret, ultra-filtration is needed. Pollen serves as a fingerprint; it can tell you exactly where the honey came from, and would trace it all the way back to China. 'We are well aware of the tricks being used by some brokers to sell honey that originated in China and laundering it in a second country by filtering out the pollen and other adulterants,' said Eric Wenger, director of quality services for Golden Heritage Foods. How to differentiate between real honey and fake Ultra-filtration produces a crystal clear, easy-to-pour, yellowish liquid, while raw unprocessed honey is cloudier, and less pourable and spreadable. It can still contain small parts of the honeycomb, too. If you are a honey lover, you should stick to buying honey from a local, organic farm or co-op. According to the findings of Food Safety News , 76 percent of samples bought at grocery stores had all pollen removed. All samples coming from drugstores or single portion packages from fast food chains such as KFC and McDonalds had all pollen removed. On the contrary, samples that came from farmers' markets, co-ops and natural stores like PCC and Trader Joe's, all had a decent amount of pollen and could be called real honey. "
0," A new study published in the journal Lancet , the same journal that in 2010 corruptly pulled Dr. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study linking the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to bowel disease and autism ( http://www.selfnews.com ), suggests that drugging those with 'pre-diabetes' may be a viable way to prevent the onset of diabetes. Concocted by a research team from the so-called Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), the study makes the painfully obvious claim that individuals with normal blood sugar levels are far less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than individuals with elevated blood sugar levels. But rather than have pre-diabetic patients exclusively follow proper dietary and exercise protocols to keep their blood sugar levels in check, the researchers make the implication that 'preventative' drugs may be the preferred option. The study included 1,990 participants who were part of the larger Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, an ongoing observational study that compares the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in preventing diabetes. Among this group, 736 participants were randomly assigned to 'intensive lifestyle intervention' as their treatment, while 647 were given metformin, a blood glucose drug. The remaining 607 participants were given a placebo. In the end, those who successfully returned to normal glucose regulation from all groups were found to be 56 percent less likely to go on to develop diabetes than those whose blood sugar levels remained elevated. This makes sense, of course, as blood sugar levels that persistently remain high are oftentimes indicative of oncoming diabetes, as the body becomes increasingly unable to produce enough insulin to normalize blood sugar levels. But of particular concern in the study is its implication that 'intensive lifestyle intervention,' which is not specifically defined, is no better than placebo at preventing diabetes among those who do not attain normal glucose regulation. In other words, metformin and potentially other drug interventions are insinuated to be a more effective diabetes prevention method than lifestyle and dietary changes. Paving the way for universal diabetes 'pre-treatment' But since 'intensive lifestyle intervention' is not clearly defined in the study, there is no way to know what this term actually means. Did the participants in the lifestyle change group continue to consume high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), for instance, which has been shown not only to be vastly different in composition to glucose and other forms of sugar, but also a specific aggravator of diabetes? The study also fails to specify whether those in the so-called 'intensive lifestyle intervention' group consumed blood sugar-regulating foods such as non-irradiated cinnamon and cayenne pepper, and avoided eating diabetes-promoting foods like refined grains, processed foods and excess sugars. And if they did follow these dietary patterns, how strictly did participants follow them and in what quantities did they eat, or not eat, certain foods? These are details that make all the difference in determining the effectiveness of any 'intensive lifestyle intervention,' as conventional dietary and lifestyle approaches for diabetics often conflict with real-life approaches that actually work. This was seen recently in the case of Steve Cooksey, the North Carolina blogger who was targeted for his anti-diabetes protocols that directly contradict his state's official recommendations http://www.selfnews.com ). Just like with statin drugs ( http://www.selfnews.com/029467_statin_drugs_fast_food.html ), mainstream medicine is trying to turn glucose-regulating drugs into some type of pseudo-preventative supplement that people take before they even have diabetes. And if enough studies come out supporting the idea that taking such drugs can prevent disease, it may be considered prudent and economically viable to begin treating healthy people with such drugs as a type of pre-treatment. You can prevent diabetes by simply eating right and exercising The good news, however, is that controlling blood sugar levels does not require taking drugs. The first step is to simply eliminate poisons like HFCS; refined white flour (and for some people, all gluten-based products); soy-based foods and additives; omega-6-rich oils like canola and soybean; artificial flavorings and additives; and hormone- and antibiotic-laden conventional meat products from your diet. The second step is to replace these foods with stevia or very small quantities of low-glycemic sweeteners like natural agave and coconut sugar; gluten-free or even fully grain-free foods; omega-3-rich foods and oils like salmon, hemp, chia; organic, grass-fed meats; and organic, nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables. Exercising regularly, which may include bouncing on a rebounder in the morning ( http://www.selfnews.com/031739_rebounding_cell_health.html ), will also go a long way towards normalizing cell function throughout the body, which in turn will help regulate metabolism and blood sugar levels. Drinking plenty of fluoride- and chemical-free water; consuming trace mineral-rich sea and mineral salts; keeping your body alkaline ( http://www.selfnews.com/Report_acid_alkaline_pH_0.html ); and juicing regularly all play a vital role in overall bodily health as well.

0," It has been established that infant formula increases the risk of severe, debilitating and even fatal childhood diseases through a wide range of epidemiological studies. Is it really any wonder when we allow chemicals such as Cupric sulfate a known pesticide, herbicide and fungicide in baby and infant formulas? (1,4,5,6,7) What is cupric sulfate? Cupric sulfate is an inorganic salt which is widely used in industry, agriculture, and veterinary medicine. (2) Cupric sulfate is also used in copperplating, in dyeing (as a mordant), in wet-cell batteries, in pigments, and algicides. (1). So what in the world is this doing in baby formula? This chemical is listed plainly on the ingredient label of many prominent baby food formulas, including Enfamil (3, 4), Similac , (5), and Earth's Best Organic (6). You can even find it in Centrum and One-a-Day vitamins. Research has identified a link between cupric sulfate and many negative conditions such as arsenic poisoning, DNA damage, heavy metal toxicity and mercury poisoning. Much of this research dates as far back as 1991, so why are companies still allowing this chemical in consumer products, and notably in baby formulas? What's the risk? The following information is taken directly from the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for Cupric Sulfate: Section 3: Hazards Identification, of the Material Safety Data Sheet for cupric sulfate show Potential Acute Health Effects: Hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation. Potential Chronic Health Effects: CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. MUTAGENIC EFFECTS: Mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells. TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY: Not available. The substance may be toxic to kidneys, liver. Repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage. (7) Section 7: Handling and Storage, states the following precautions 'Do not ingest, do not breathe dust, wear protective clothing. If ingested, seek medical advice immediately. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.' (7) Additional factors to consider According to Drugs.com, cupric sulfate is for animal use only and should be kept out of reach for children. (8) Acute doses of cupric sulfate reduce the gastric mucosal barrier capacity, independently of the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. (9) Heavy metal accumulation and associated biochemical alterations are found in Autistic Spectrum Disorder. (10) Breastfeeding is still the best option Mother's colostrum is nutrient rich and provides antibodies to protect a nursing baby. Breastfeeding is shown to reduce the risk of allergic and respiratory diseases. (11) Breast milk is the first nutritional choice for all babies and infants. If a mother is unable to breastfeed, donor milk would be the next best option although some nutritional elements are inactivated by the pasteurization process; it still has documented advantages when compared to formula. (12) Breast milk changes as your baby grows and is easier to digest. The protection that breast milk offers is unique and can't be duplicated by formula. Increasing evidence suggests that exclusive breastfeeding may have a significant impact on the prevention of diabetes in adult life. (13) Formula fed babies have higher risks of asthma, type 2 diabetes, obesity. (14) "
0," Beta radiation levels are off the charts at monitoring sites all across North America, according to new reports. But experts are blaming these radiation spikes on practically everything except for Fukushima. Data gathered from tracking units in California, Arizona, Illinois and elsewhere reveal radiation levels up to 50,000 percent higher than what was observed at the same time last year, and in some cases compared to levels seen this past summer. EnviroReporter.com says the impacted sites are scattered throughout the country and aren't just confined to the West Coast. Readings taken near Los Angeles; Chicago; Montgomery, Alabama; and Madison, Wisconsin, reveal total beta counts per minute (CPM) greatly exceeding the 1,000 CPM threshold considered by the government to be problematic. In Tucson, Arizona, for instance, a 460 CPM reading was recently taken, which is more than 10 times higher than the reading taken last year on November 27. Similarly, Phoenix, Arizona's 735 CPM reading measured more than 21 times higher than last year's reading. San Diego appears to be one of the hardest-hit areas, with a CPM reading of 650, as of October 1. This figure is 60 times higher than it was last year on the same date, despite the fact that San Diego's normal background radiation rate typically hovers around 20 CPM. 'U.S. Environmental Protection Agency RadNet radiation monitors have detected renewed surges in atmospheric readings of dangerous beta radiation across the country,' explains EnviroReporter.com about the seemingly inexplicable phenomenon. 'Over a dozen metropolitan test sites have registered four-month highs in EnviroReporter.com's most recent comprehensive assessment.' Radiation testing site near Chicago records radiation levels thousands of times higher than maximum safety threshold Commenting on the situation, one EnviroReporter.com reader offered his own assessment that these readings are 'astronomically high.' He was quick to denounce Fukushima as a possible cause, though, adding that this would only be possible if 'something there has changed dramatically.' Either way, the radiation levels being detected are still a major cause for concern. Anything above 100 CPM is considered by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to be a potential hazardous materials situation requiring the deployment of hazmat protocols. At a testing site in St. Charles, Illinois, located just west of Chicago, a recent peak reading of 7,298 CPM caught the attention of some environmental activists, who chided the media for remaining silent on the issue. This reading represents a nearly 7,300 percent radiation increase beyond CHP's safety threshold. This site apparently experienced a series of massive radiation spikes beginning at approximately 1:00 am and lasting for as long as six hours. California official blames plastic eating utensils for radiation spike, insist it can't be Fukushima Back in California, county officials in San Mateo recorded radiation levels at a local beach measuring 100 micro-REM per hour, or 1 microsievert per hour, which is five times the normal amount. According to the Half Moon Bay Review , local environmental health director Dean Peterson was quick to denounce that this level poses any risk to human health. When asked where this radiation might be coming from, Peterson admitted that he is 'befuddled,' but also denied that Fukushima could possibly be a cause. Instead, he says, it may be due to an excess of disposable eating utensils polluting the area. 'I honestly think the end result of this is that it's just higher levels of background radiation,' stated Peterson to the HMB Review , adding that red-painted disposable eating utensils can also contribute to localized radiation spikes.

0," Tweet Continuing with the investigative report on hoodia gordonii, a natural appetite suppressant, let's now explore the issue of how appetite control impacts weight loss. (If you missed it, click here to view part 1 .) For most people, the real weight loss challenge has relatively to do with dieting, exercise, supplements, or how many calories you burn in the gym. The real challenge is controlling their hunger drive. People who are trying to lose weight seem to share the exact same problem. It's not that they're lazy, or that they're slobs, or that they eat junk food all day, it's that they have trouble getting their appetite under control. Hoodia gordonii, it seems, could make that much easier. Because overcoming your own hunger drive seems almost impossible unless you get some help. Think about it: the last time you tried to lose weight, what was it that finally caused you to cave in? I bet it was hunger. At some point, the hunger just took over, and you found yourself eating again. So let me share a secret with you: you can't fight mother nature. Your body was designed to survive. And to survive, your body needs to find and consume large quantities of calories. The more, the better. Remember: your body was designed for an age in which calories were hard to come by. Your body was self-motivated to go find some food. In a time when food was scarce, people who found and ate more calories survived better than those who didn't, and therefore passed on their genes to their offspring. That lineage, after hundreds of thousands of years of scarcity, leads directly to you and me. We live in bodies that were designed and built to scrounge for scarce calories in the natural environment. And the method for that motivation was simple: hunger. Your body uses hunger to whip you into action. 'Go find me some berries!' it screams. 'Get me some animal fat!' It's no coincidence that animal fat and sugar are the most sought-after comfort foods: they're rich in calories, and they convince your body that you have enough food. No wonder, then, that ice cream is the opiate of the hungry: it's made primarily of milk fat and sugar -- precisely the chemicals that stimulate a feeling of comfort. But today, we live in a society where an overabundance of food surrounds us. We have the all-you-can-eat buffet, the Costco-sized food paks, the supersized fast foods. We have restaurants that serve one person what an entire family might have eaten just two generations ago, and at every social event, there's even more food beckoning: weddings, parties, holidays, movies... you name it, there's food. And so spurred on by our innate hunger motivation, and surrounded by the modern environment of unhealthy food in mass quantities, we all eat. And eat. And we put on the pounds, just like I did, just like you did. It's only human. But what if you could turn off your hunger like a switch? When you eat hoodia, the saying goes, your hunger will simply be gone -- gone -- for around six hours. During those six hours, you won't crave anything. You really won't want to eat at all. The food still smells good, as usual, and they taste the same if you eat them, but you don't want to eat them! At least that's what the hoodia advocates claim will happen. To understand how all this works, you have to understand what 'hunger' really is in the first place. Hunger is just an illusion. It's a signal in your brain, a chemical message that causes you to feel certain feelings and, ultimately, act on them. Your body creates the illusion of hunger even when you're not really needing calories. And your body, like mine, doesn't know when to turn it off. I am your hungry hypothalamus The hunger signal is only turned off when your hypothalamus thinks you've eaten enough food. Your hypothalamus -- part of your body's endocrine system -- decides this by sensing the rise of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Eat enough carbohydrates, and your blood sugar rises, which convinces your hypothalamus to tell your brain that you're no longer hungry. This is why eating an apple is such an effective appetite suppressant. Normally, to get your hypothalamus to turn off the hunger switch, you'd have to eat a moderate amount of food. And your hypothalamus isn't very quick on the draw either: it takes around 20 minutes to figure out what you've eaten, and by that time, you've probably eaten another 800 calories. So by the time your hunger signal gets turned off, you've already overeaten yet again. This chemical fools your hypothalamus Hoodia, however, contains a chemical that gets picked up by your hypothalamus which thinks it's glucose. And as it turns out, this chemical is reportedly 10,000 times more potent than glucose in triggering the chemical receptors in your hypothalamus, and so it only takes a tiny bit of this chemical to trigger the cancellation of your hunger signals. Let me say this another way: eat this chemical, and your hypothalamus thinks you've just wolfed down three plates of food at the local buffet. Your hunger is abruptly cancelled. You just don't feel hungry anymore. Everything else is fine: there are no known side effects. But you simply don't feel like eating. At least that's what the hoodia companies explain you should experience. Consuming hoodia is surprisingly simple: slice off a piece of the succulent, peel off the thorns, and just start chewing on it. You don't even need to swallow it. The taste is rather bitter by most Americans' palettes, but after several minutes of chewing, you've already started absorbing the chemical. Guess what? Your hunger is vanishing with each passing moment. The San Tribesmen, the original discovers of the plant, also say it makes you feel stronger, more energetic, and more focused. Nobody complains of any side effects whatsoever, and the plant has been chewed for literally thousand of years by various generations of the San, with no ill effects known whatsoever. Now imagine what you could achieve in terms of weight loss by taking advantage of this natural appetite suppressant. That's exactly what we'll discuss in the next installment of this investigative report series on Hoodia Gordonii. Continue with part 3. "
0," The article which originally appeared here has been removed because it is no longer aligned with the science-based investigative mission of selfnews. In late 2013 / early 2014, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger), editor of selfnews, transitioned from outspoken activist to environmental scientist. He now runs the selfnews Forensic Food Lab, conducting world-class food science research and publishing scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through scientific investigation powered by university-level analytical instrumentation, Adams found that, much like the majority of the population, he had been suffering over the past several years from chronic exposure to cumulative toxic elements found in the food supply, including in many organics and 'superfoods.' His findings -- as well as breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, protective food nutrients and the cognitive influences of food contaminants -- are being published at selfnews.com. Notably, Adams found that exposure to toxic elements in foods altered his mindset, outlook on life and degree of happiness in the world. 'I now know that much of my outlook on the world was being negatively shaped by toxic elements found not just in everyday foods, but also in some superfoods and dietary supplements,' Adams now explains. Adams spent much of 2013 painstakingly testing his food intake for the presence of toxic elements, then taking therapeutic steps to eliminate those toxic elements from his body. 'After about six months of intense detoxification, I experienced a sudden, involuntary shift in my worldview. Fear transformed into a sense of calm. Uncertainty was replaced by inspiration. I felt a new sense of awakening and optimism combined with a strong desire to contribute meaningful knowledge to humanity,' Adams explains. As part of this transformation, Adams felt himself drawn into the realm of scientific investigations and analytical chemistry. He spent an intense six months studying university-level chemistry and learning methodologies of atomic spectroscopy , a technology used to quantitatively assess metals, minerals, toxic elements and radioactive isotopes found in all foods, beverages, soils and physical matter. By the end of 2013, Adams had completed extensive training in laboratory instrumentation and high-level chemistry, and he now operates ICP-MS atomic spectroscopy instrumentation which he uses to conduct world-class investigative research on foods, beverages and personal care products such as cosmetics. The ICP-MS instrument he uses is capable of detecting toxic elements at parts per trillion concentrations. His current research not only covers toxic elements but also radioactive isotopes and the global contamination of the food supply with fallout from nearly 70 years of atomic bomb testing. He has begun intensive research on the radioactive contamination of ocean foods from the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, and he has developed unique scientific methologies surrounding the detection and interpretation of data involving radioactive isotopes such as Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Uranium-235. Focused on food science solutions for humanity The Health Ranger's research is now focused on helping save humanity from toxic elements in foods and the environment, including food toxins, water toxins, GMO toxins, pesticides and herbicides, radioactive elements from nuclear accidents and nuclear testing, contaminated soils, adulterated foods and more. Through this research, Adams developed several breakthrough discoveries in food technology, toxicology and nutrition, and he has authored several scientific papers which are being published in 2014. 'Each of these discoveries has the potential to not just save millions of lives across the globe,' Adams explains, 'but to radically reshape the future of human civilization in a positive direction free from war, poisons and environmental destruction.' His new mission is to freely share his discoveries with the world so that humanity can heal from what he calls 'a century of industrial contamination that has driven the human race into a self-intoxicating spiral of clinical insanity.' Mike Adams (aka the 'Health Ranger') is also the executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center ( www.ConsumerWellness.org ), an organization which has already awarded tens of thousands of dollars worth of grants around the world for prenatal nutrition and children's nutrition programs. Click here to see some of the CWC's success stories . Once an outspoken critic and activist, Adams now sees far greater potential in scientific discovery and problem solving. 'One of the things that came out of my own personal healing from toxic element contamination was a rewened, almost hyper-magnified sense of compassion for fellow human beings. Coupled with that, I was blessed with the cognitive capacities needed to discover a new paradigm of scientific knowledge that can help end suffering and eradicate much of the degenerative disease, mental illness and behavioral violence that currently plagues humankind. My deepest desire is to share this knowledge with the world and show others how to use it to heal their minds and bodies, their families, their communities, their nations and ultimately our fragile civilization.' 'Everything is at stake. If we do not change course, human civilization will not survive its own poisoning,' Adams warns. 'But now, thanks to these extraordinary discoveries, we have a blueprint for a way out that can put humankind back on a path of abundance, sanity, health, happiness, cooperation rather than conflict, and accelerated awakening of human consciousness and scientific progress.'

0," Recent storms dropped torrential rains across much of California, causing flooding and mudslides across many areas, leaving some residents homeless and killing at least two people. There was even a tornado in Los Angeles. Despite record rainfall on December 10 of between 1.54 inches at Long Beach Airport and 2.36 inches in Oxnard, the amount of rain that fell was a mere drop in the bucket for this drought-stricken state. A milder storm December 12 added to the rainfall total. These early-winter storms left behind a combined 166 billion gallons of water, which seems like an enormous amount of water, but in reality is only enough water for 2.5 million people for one year. Given that California has been in a drought since 2011, and has a population of over 38 million, it is clear that California is far from done with its water woes. According to an article by the San Jose Mercury News , the California Department of Water Resources estimates that California will need six more major winter storms dropping similar amounts of rain to bring an end to the drought. 1922 Colorado River Compact still the base document for West's water management James Eklund, director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, isn't waiting to find out if those storms occur over the next few months and is working on policies to address the situation now and in the coming decades. About 4.6 trillion gallons of water run down off the Rocky Mountains as the snow melts in spring. Much of the water flows downstream to Arizona, Nevada, Mexico and California. Two-thirds of the snowmelt-generated water belongs to these downstream regions, also known as the Lower Basin states, while one-third of the water belongs to the Upper Basin states, which include Utah and Wyoming, as well as Colorado , per the 1922 Colorado River Compact. James Eklund does not want to deprive the Lower Basin states of their apportionment; he just wants to ensure that any excess generated in Colorado stays in Colorado. Looking to water consumption in the future A number of factors affect decisions such as this. Colorado's population is expected to grow from the current 5 .5 million to somewhere near 9 million by 2050. All other factors being the same, Colorado will experience a 60 percent increase in water usage over the next 35 years. Drought can hit anywhere, as happened in Colorado in 2002-2003, which led to development of a new water management plan. The plan doesn't currently address a long-contentious issue in the state that allows 163 billion gallons of water to be transported from west of the Continental Divide to the more heavily populated Front Range that includes cities like Denver and Colorado Springs in the east. The new plan does call for considering conservation and recycling alternatives before building any other pipelines. These are topics all states should be considering. In California , agriculture accounts for 80 percent of all water used in a given year while accounting for less than 2.5 percent of California's income. Water-intensive crops, such as alfalfa and rice, take up a significant amount of the agricultural use, with alfalfa farmers using fully 20 percent of the water to grow a crop used primarily to feed dairy cows in the state. Alfalfa crops account for only 4 percent of state farming revenue. California plan only addresses 20 percent of water consumption Based on these facts, you might think Governor Brown's 2014 California Water Action plan would place a premium on developing water conservation legislation and practices that would concentrate on agricultural water consumption and best practices. Sadly, it does not. Instead, it concentrates primarily on urban water consumption and extends Senate Bill X7-7, a law passed in 2009 which contains the goal of reducing per capita urban water use by 20 percent by December 31, 2020, and suggests holding water consumption at 2000 levels until 2030. Almost as an afterthought, the plan states that 'the administration will also work with local and regional entities to develop performance measures to evaluate agricultural water management.' No performance measures for agricultural water consumption are given. The California Water Action Plan leaves little doubt as to why James Eklund and the Colorado Water Conservation Board have adopted such an aggressive posture in the West's war for water. Poor planning on California's part isn't going to constitute an emergency for Coloradans.

0," Pills have become the solution to every problem. A new trend in psychiatry is the prescription of strong and toxic antipsychotic drugs to children with ADHD as well as other behavioral disorders. The 'off label' use of these drugs can come with a host of dangerous side effects-effects much worse than the behavioral problems they are supposedly treating. The type of antipsychotics being administered is considered 'atypical' or second-generation meaning that they have only been on the market since the 1990s. Usually they are prescribed to adults with serious mental disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. However, a study has shown that the amount of children being prescribed antipsychotics has increased seven-fold in an eight year period. Furthermore, adolescents are also showing increasing rates of antipsychotic prescriptions. Overall, while according to the study, every age bracket is being prescribed more antipsychotics today than in previous years, children and adolescents show higher rates of prescriptions than adults. Many of the prescriptions written to these children weren't even written by psychiatrists, but general practitioners who haven't been trained specifically in behavioral, cognitive, or mental disorders. There are reasons that the numbers of antipsychotics prescribed for children with behavioral disorders is skyrocketing. The drugs show drastic improvement in the hyperactivity, irritability, and defiance associated with ADHD. The reason for this seeming improvement is the fact that these atypical antipsychotics act on the frontal lobe of the brain-the area lobotomies effect. Dr. Peter Breggin, who publicly decries the use of antipsychotics in children, has this to say: 'We have a national catastrophe. This is a situation where we have ruined the brains of millions of children ...These are lobotomizing drugs. Of course, they will reduce all behavior, including irritability.' The use of these drugs is replacing other, perhaps more effective solutions such as therapy and family counseling as the children in the study were not shown to be receiving either. The medical industry is pushing the quicker, easier, yet more toxic solution to younger people. Turning children with disruptive behaviors into chemically lobotomized zombies are not the only dangers of these drugs . The atypical class of antipsychotics is known for its list of dangerous side effects, which children are much more vulnerable to, including rapid weight gain, increase in blood pressure, metabolic abnormalities as well as a slew of disturbing neurological side effects. Tardive Dyskinesia is a permanent, drug-induced neurological condition which manifests itself through involuntary tics and jerks, and has been attributed to atypical antipsychotics. Dystonia, which causes painful, involuntary muscle contractions, has also been noted with these drugs as well as a more serious disorder which can kill a person within 24 hours-neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The most serious risk of all; however, is the risk of death to which there have been 45 pediatric deaths between the years of 2000 and 2004, where atypical antipsychotics was the primary cause of death, the FDA reported. Have Americans become so lazy that they are willing to risk the lives of their children because they are a bit hyperactive? A healthful diet, plenty of exercise, or even therapy could all be utilized to improve the behavior of most of these 'disruptive' children without turning to antipsychotics. Instead, children are being chemically lobotomized with drugs that can damage them for life. "
0," Over 8 billion chickens are raised for meat annually in the United States. Some are raised inhumanely in factory farms, providing cheap meat. Other chicken producers pledge to raise chickens in free-range, humane conditions. At the supermarket, the labels on the bags of chicken may read 'natural' or 'cage-free,' but these labels aren't telling the whole story, in the case of one company. The third largest chicken producer in the country, Perdue, claims to be one of the most ethical chicken producers in the US, with the USDA verifying that their chickens are 'humanely raised.' Perdue states on their website, 'To give consumers the assurance they are looking for about how the chicken they are eating was raised, fed and processed, we worked directly with the USDA to create verification programs to address these areas.' 'The result? Perdue became the first poultry company to receive the USDA Process Verified Seal.' Whistleblower exposes Perdue's disguised inhumane chicken-raising operation According to one farmer and whistleblower, Mr. Craig Watts, all the fancy USDA verification and 'natural' labeling is just for show. Watts is a contractor for Perdue farms and works up close with the chickens Perdue sends to him. A 22-year-old veteran in the business, Watts knew how horrible the conditions were for the birds. He decided to blow the whistle on Perdue. He called in a notable farm animal welfare organization, Compassion in World Farming, to help shine a light on the conditions. What they documented in this video changed everything, pointing out the conditions. Perdue's 'humanely raised' birds are bred to get so big so fast that they can hardly stand on their own two feet in the last week of their lives. The birds are forced to reach market weight in just 42 days compared to the slow natural growth of traditional breeds, which takes 80 - 120 days. The video captures the birds being hardly able to breathe because of this. These supposedly free-range animals are also contained in overcrowded warehouses that deprive the birds of natural light and fresh air. These large sheds hold over 30,000 birds in one place. The tiny amount of space per bird makes their legs weak due to lack of exercise. Many can't even walk and suffer because of this. The birds are trapped in place their entire life on a bed of feces-ridden litter that is rarely even changed between flocks. At the end of the market cycle, the birds can be seen panting, immobilized in their own waste. Perdue blames the whistle blower and all their contractors for the inhumane conditions, loses business in the process Americans despise factory-farmed chickens, but what they really don't want is a government safety agency like the USDA putting their stamp of approval on the operation and calling it 'humane' and 'cage-free.' When whistleblower Watts turned his video footage over to the Center for Food Integrity for official review, he received backlash. CFI re-framed the video and blamed Watts for poor management. The mainstream media followed the narrative, taking the blame off Perdue farms and the USDA and instead blamed the whistleblower and the other farmers. What's interesting is that Watts has been in the business for 22 years and has even been awarded by Perdue as a top producer. It looked like Perdue was going to be let off the hook and no changes were going to be made to their chicken production process or deceptive labeling practices. That's when one consumer posted this on Perdue's Facebook page: 'Nice retaliation against a farmer who wants his unhealthy chickens to see the light of day. I will never buy Perdue again.' The comment stirred Perdue management. Within weeks, Watts was visited six times by Perdue management. Over 22,000 emails were sent from concerned consumers to supermarkets across the country asking for better treatment of chickens. As Perdue lost thousands of customers, they learned one thing: Trying to silence farmers who want to reform the industry will only backfire. Blaming and suppressing farmers who want to do better for America is no way to win American's trust. Perdue and Kroger settled lawsuits in October 2014, agreeing to remove the 'humanely raised' labels from their Harvestland and Simple Truth chicken brands.

0," Reishi mushrooms, also known as Ganoderma lucidum , have been praised for a very long time by Chinese and Japanese health practitioners. It was always regarded by Eastern royalty as the medicine of immortality. Although the Western world has barely started scratching the surface in regards to its true healing potential, researchers have still accumulated extensive data demonstrating that reishi definitely has life extending properties. Research conducted on laboratory mice showed that reishi was responsible for prolonging their life span by around 9% to 20%, the equivalent being about 7 to 16 human years. Reishi displays the ability to reinvigorate brain neurons and capture and remove cancer cells. Plus, it inhibits the expansion of new fat cells in individuals suffering from obesity. It possesses dozens of natural bio-active compounds that have the ability to naturally treat a wide array of other harmful conditions or diseases, such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, asthma, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and liver diseases, just to name a few. Reishi can help better manage age related mechanisms So what makes it so appealing for your overall health ? It seems that reishi doesn't only target specific areas of the body but rather makes its effects felt on a much broader spectrum. You must remember that there isn't one single cause of aging and disease. There are various factors contributing to poor physical states; so, in order to reverse the undesired physical results, the actions to enhance your health must be global; therefore, you need to focus on a multi-targeted approach. That's precisely why the reishi mushroom is so powerful and useful with its hundreds of biologically active molecules working together in a synergetic way. Researchers now know that three main components are essential to its anti-aging properties. Its polysaccharides help avoid cancer by boosting the immune system. Its triterpenes protect the liver, lower cholesterol levels and stabilize blood pressure. Its ganoderma lucidum peptide also plays a very important antioxidant role. These key components all provide the best possible protection on a cellular or DNA level. In a study undertaken with humans, 1100 mg doses of reishi mushrooms were given to the healthy participants. The scientists noted that the plasma antioxidant levels rose quite rapidly to finally peak after approximately 90 minutes, while the urine antioxidant capacity (the measure of what has been in the body to be expelled) increased by 29% after only 3 hours. Most importantly, no signs of toxicity or side effects were reported at the end of this study. Reishi or, better yet, ganoderma lucidum can be taken orally mainly through supplements, but it is now also being commercialized and sold as a coffee product. You'll definitely want to make sure about the quality and purity of the product before buying this wonderful gift from life. "
0," During his first campaign for president, then-Sen. Barack Obama said his would be 'the most transparent' in the history of the country. Indeed, after he was elected to his first term, President Obama issued a memorandum to the federal bureaucracy which said, in part: My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government. And: Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset. My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use. While the president's proclamation makes for a good talking point, the reality is that 'government transparency' is often forced , thanks to a combination of factors: whistleblowing government employees and contractors (like Edward Snowden) and an inquiring media. While the press has often given Obama a pass when it comes to key political fights, to be fair, there have been a number of occasions during his presidency when the Fourth Estate has actually done its duty and attempted to hold his government to account. For that, the Fourth Estate has paid a chilling price: Obama's administration has spied on the media, stolen phone records and has even attempted to prosecute members of the media. Transparency? Not so much In fact, the Obama regime has made a habit of prosecuting whistleblowers in general -- more so than any prior administration. In 2011, the list was already long and, in some cases, distinguished . As noted by a report last fall, the Obama Administration has prosecuted more national security 'leakers' than all other presidencies combined, eight to three. Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel for the ACLU's Washington office, went a step further. In a an October 2014 blog post , he noted: Partially because of press freedom concerns, sentencing in media leak cases has historically been relatively light. Not so under President Obama. When it comes to sending these folks to jail, the Obama administration blows every other presidency combined out of the water -- by a lot. By my count, the Obama administration has secured 526 months of prison time for national security leakers, versus only 24 months total jail time for everyone else since the American Revolution. It's important -- and telling -- to note that the bulk of that time is the 35 years in Fort Leavenworth handed down to Chelsea Manning. As researched by Rottman, here is the list of pre-Obama national security prosecutions and sentences: -- Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo (1973): These men were prosecuted for leaking the Pentagon Papers , a report commissioned by then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara that showed U.S. involvement in Indochina long before the Vietnam War. Government charges against them were dropped amid political scandal within the Nixon Administration. -- Samuel Morison (1985): This Navy analyst sent pictures of the Soviet navy to Jane's Fighting Ships , which is a reference book of global warships. He was sentenced to 24 months but subsequently pardoned by President Clinton over CIA objections. -- Larry Franklin (2005): This Pentagon analyst was charged with leaking Iran-related material to lobbyists working for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent University of Pennsylvania study confirms what most parents already know: children are more likely to choose and even enjoy eating cereal if there is a licensed cartoon character on the box. More interesting is the news that if there are no cartoon characters on the box, kids are more likely to choose cereal which is labeled as healthy. Keri Gans, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, says, 'This tells us what we've probably already guessed: that young children are going to be more likely to enjoy their cereal if it has one of their favorite characters on it.' Researchers were surprised that children in the study were more likely to avoid cereal with the word sugar in the title. Matt Lapierre, one author from the study, notes that this could be because children are growing up today with a negative association with sugar. However, cereal manufacturers are responding to this issue by removing the word sugar from their labels and replacing it with words like honey or golden--even though the cereals may contain the exact amount of sugar as they did under the previous label. The researchers wrote: 'We believe there are two potential explanations for this finding. The first is that from a young age, children are commonly told that sugary foods are bad and should be avoided. As such it is possible that children were reacting less enthusiastically to the name...because of these negatives associations. Furthermore, we noted in our survey of cereals currently marketed to children that although many cereals use names that imply a sweet taste, none included the word sugar in the title.' The children seemed to have the right motivation--to choose the healthier cereal--but this was easily overridden when their favorite movie characters showed up on the box. This is obviously something food manufacturers use to their advantage. So what can parents do? One suggestion is to simply make children aware of how advertising can influence their decisions. While this isn`t always enough, it plants a seed that will later empower children to understand how to make informed decisions later in life. Keeping a variety of healthy, unprocessed foods is also important for making sure kids have plenty of other choices available to them. Children who eat plenty of balanced, whole foods are more likely to avoid serious cravings for junk food.

0," Most selfnews readers know some of the health values of vitamin D3, which go well beyond the accepted bone health quality. But how much is enough and how little is not enough is a controversial subject. Adding to the confusion is some concern of how much would lead to excessive vitamin D3 intake to produce the rare event of vitamin D toxicity. Vitamin D3 toxicity from skin exposure to sunlight or UVB (ultraviolet B) tanning beds is normally impossible. The process of epidermal cholesterol converting the UVB rays into the vitamin D3 precursor, cholicalciferol has the built in feature of slowing or stopping that process if too much vitamin D3 starts accumulating in your blood. That cholicalciferol is converted in a two stage process by first the liver then the kidneys to create the active vitamin D3 hormone calcitriol . Even large doses of vitamin D3 supplements have rarely caused a toxic reaction. But because vitamin D3 supplements are fat soluble, the toxic effects can linger longer than other toxic events. However, only three cases of vitamin D toxicity have been recorded, and they were supplementing over 40,000 IUs (international units) daily. Most doctors and nutritional experts recommend having 25(OH)D testing done to determine your vitamin D3 blood levels while supplementing 1000 to 5000 IUs of vitamin D3 supplements daily. Vitamin D3 supplements contain cholicalciferol, taken from the lanolin of sheep's wool after shearing. The cholicalciferol that is normally produced by the interaction of UVB sun rays with a form of cholesterol in our skin is encapsulated in those supplements. The convenience of supplements bypasses our body's automatic safeguard feature that limits the conversion of UVB rays forming cholicalciferol, which our livers and kidneys then use to manufacture vitamin D3. Regardless, toxicity is very rare. Recent study sets a positive health vitamin D3 threshold lower than most savvy experts A Washington University study recorded May 1st, 2012 in the Annals of Internal Medicine by Dr. Ian de Boer, resulted in a minimum D3 blood level vitamin that merely duplicates mainstream medicine's recommendation. Dr. de Boer's research team used 25(OH)D test data on stored blood samples from older adults who had enrolled in a nationwide cardiovascular health study from 1992 to 2006. They did a statistical follow up on major medical events these older adults had incurred and compared them to the D3 blood counts. Their study on 1,621 senior citizens concluded that 20 ng/ml (nano-grams/milliliter) in blood serum is the cutoff point. In other words, below 20 ng/ml in blood serum invites seriously worsening health. This is exactly what mainstream medicine considers as the minimum vitamin D3 level to ward off major disease. As we age, the process of converting sunlight to D3 wanes, and there are many who disagree with the study's recommendation. Experts consider mainstream vitamin D3 threshold for health too low for optimum health The Vitamin D Panels nutritionally qualified members consider the recommended doses of D3 supplementation of no more than 800 IUs way too low for eliminating D3 deficiencies. So do many other experts. They've also determined a higher threshold of blood serum levels for optimum health . Another study of D3 blood serum level samples among extremely healthy inhabitants of tropical and sub-tropical areas showed blood serum levels of D3 between 50 ng/ml and 70 ng/ml. Under 50 ng/ml is considered D3 deficient by many experts who strive for optimum, preventative health instead of determining what levels guarantee hospitalization. Caveat: People afflicted with tuberculosis, lymphoma, or sarcoidosis should use the 1,25(OH)D test instead of the 25(OH)D test before supplementing D3. You'll find several vitamin D3 articles here: http://www.selfnews.com "
0," Evidence is growing that the statins used to treat high cholesterol may cause liver damage in high doses. A new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology examined the results of 23 large clinical trials of statins for patterns of liver damage, measured by an increased concentration of the enzymes released when liver cells die. The researchers found that high-dose statins caused 2.4 times as many cases of liver damage as low-dose statins, or 271 cases per 100,000 patients. When the researchers looked at individual statin drugs, they found that Zocor (simvastatin) was 1.6 more dangerous in high doses than low doses, and Lipitor (atorvastatin) was 4.0 times more dangerous. The new study is consistent with prior studies, such as one in the 'New England Journal of Medicine' that found a 5.5 higher risk of liver damage from maximum-dose Lipitor relative to a lower dose. Another 'New England Journal of Medicine' study found that maximum-dose Lipitor was 4.5 times more likely to cause liver damage than a placebo. Most cases of liver damage from statins are minor and reversible, but some can be severe or even potentially fatal. The studies in the 'New England Journal of Medicine' found that due to increased mortality from other causes, such as cancer, maximum-dose Lipitor did not in fact decrease mortality in patients taking it, even though it did prevent heart attacks and strokes. The study in the 'Journal of the American College of Cardiology' also found that rates of cancer among those using statins went up as both LDL and total cholesterol levels decreased. Likewise, cancer risk increased along with the dose of statins being taken. The researchers suggested that lower doses of statins should be preferentially prescribed over higher doses, except in cases where a specific LDL cholesterol level needs to be achieved. 'A higher dose of statin is associated with increased risk of toxicity, [so] it may be prudent not to use a statin dose beyond what is required to achieve the LDL target,' the researchers wrote. "
0," Tweet The epilepsy drug valproate poses a higher risk for fetal death and birth defects than other commonly used epilepsy drugs, according to a study published in the August 8, 2006, issue of Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Of the four epilepsy drugs tested in the study, valproate posed the highest risk to the fetus with over 20 percent of the pregnancies exposed to valproate resulting in death or birth defects such as skull and limb deformities and brain, heart and lung problems. The rate was lower for the drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine. The study's findings are consistent with several other recent studies. 'The evidence is compelling that valproate poses a higher risk of birth defects than other commonly used epilepsy drugs,' said study author Kimford Meador, MD, of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida and a fellow at the American Academy of Neurology. 'Unfortunately, many doctors and pregnant women aren't aware of the risks.' The study examined 333 pairs of mother and child in the United States and the United Kingdom. Meador is recommending doctors talk with their patients about the risks associated with valproate when choosing an epilepsy drug for women of child-bearing age. Patients already taking valproate should also be advised of the risk. 'Although valproate will continue to be an important treatment option in women who aren't able to use other epilepsy drugs, we're advising valproate not be used as the drug of first choice for women of child bearing potential, and when used, its dosage should be limited if possible,' said Meador.

0," A volunteer patient has developed cancer after participating in a London drug study that ended in disaster and outrage, and left the healthcare system in shock. Earlier this year healthy, paid volunteers became the test subjects for a new drug made to treat leukemia and chronic inflammation. Two were given harmless placebos, while the other six volunteers were given the drug, which was in its first phase of human testing. All six patients reported tragic side effects, and a few nearly died. Several weeks ago one volunteer, David Oakley, tested positive for the early stages of cancer. Strange cells had shown up in his blood tests, which doctors confirmed as signs of the disease. They say since it was caught so early, the cancer is treatable. 'I can't dwell on it because if I dwell on it I'm just going to go down in a heap,' Oakley said of his struggle to remain positive. Other volunteers experienced side effects that posed serious health risks; the neck of one patient increased to three times its normal size, while another patient's head grew to the size of his waist. Oakley believes the drug company Paraxel should be held accountable for their wrongdoing. Paraxel denies any wrongdoing and insist their practices met legal requirements, although investigation by British regulatory agencies found that procedures were not followed properly. ### "
0," Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Health Sciences University have published evidence that cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk is present in the blood fractions of adolescents who consume a lot of fructose, a scenario that worsens in the face of excess belly fat. Published in the Journal of Nutrition , scientists determined that high dietary fructose consumption results in lower levels of cardiovascular protectors such as HDL cholesterol and adiponectin, due in part to how the body metabolizes the fruit-based mega-sweetener at the cellular level. Excess body fat accumulated around the mid-section, a rapidly growing problem in adolescents, compounds the problem when compared to those with less visceral fat deposits. A wealth of scientifically validated research studies now highlight the importance of eliminating fructose in all its forms from the diets of both adults and children alike to dramatically reduce risk of diabetes and heart disease. The study detailed an analysis of 559 adolescents, aged 14 to 18 and detailed cardiovascular risk factors including high blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin resistance and blood inflammatory factors. Excess fat around the midsection was found to exacerbate the identified risk factors, as compared to those with generalized fat right beneath the skin known as subcutaneous fat, where an association was not evident. Fructose metabolism increases risk from metabolic and fatty liver disease Consumption of fructose is higher in children and adolescents, placing them at increased risk for heart disease and metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Fructose or simple fruit sugar is naturally found in fruits and vegetables where it is closely bound with fiber and is slowly released into the blood stream. Many processed food and drink manufacturers use liberal quantities of pure high fructose corn syrup extract that is metabolized through a different pathway as compared to glucose or table sugar. One of the study authors, Dr. Norman Pollock noted 'Fructose itself is metabolized differently than other sugars and has some byproducts that are believed to be bad for us... there's something in the syrup processing that plays a role in the bad byproducts of metabolism.' The Corn Refiners Association, through a never ending barrage of advertisements, wants you to believe that there is no difference between high fructose corn syrup and regular sugar. Medical research has documented that fructose is processed primarily in the liver where it wreaks havoc, leading to fatty liver disease and even cirrhosis after excessive and repeated exposure. Parents and caregivers to children will want to dramatically curb or eliminate fructose in the diet by removing processed foods and sugary beverages. Limit fruit consumption and natural fruit juices that can lead to excess consumption of the fruit sugar. It is especially important to read nutritional labels as fructose and high fructose corn syrup appear in many unsuspecting food sources. Nutrition experts recommend limiting natural fructose consumption to no more than 25 grams per day at an early age to minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in later life. "
0," As more and more people wake up to the dangers of fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, and the many other toxic compounds found in municipal water supplies, the market for bottled water has exploded. But in the process, some major food and beverage corporations have unwittingly begun peddling that very same tap water in bottles as 'pure,' a deceptive labeling term that is the subject of a new trade controversy in Europe. According to a recent report by Occupy Monsanto , the Dasani water brand, which is owned by beverage giant Coca-Cola, is one such bottled water counterfeit, if you will, that contains purified tap water dressed in fancy-looking bottles. Like many other bottled water brands, Dasani is sold at a premium price, and many people perceive it to be superior to tap water, even though it actually is just tap water. Even though the majority of the impurities have admittedly been removed from Dasani water, and minerals added back in, many people do not realize that the water contained in Dasani bottles is not actually from a natural spring. If you read closely the labels found on water bottles, it usually spells out the source where the water inside was derived. But this information is often overlooked by consumers who believe they are buying something superior. 'Figures from independent beverage research company Canadean show that at least two out of every five bottles of water sold around the world are, like Dasani, 'purified' waters, rather than 'source' waters which originate from a spring,' explains Trevor Datson in an Occupy Monsanto piece. 'Most of the supermarket own-label bottled waters consist of treated mains water . In short, they are subjected to many of the same treatments that source waters undergo to satisfy public health requirements after being pumped up from the ground.' The significance of this is that water specifically derived from a natural spring actually is superior to the water supplied by the local tap, at least in most cases. Many people who buy bottled water assume their water comes from a spring, because this is how the bottled water industry got its start. But today, brands like Dasani , Aquafina, and Sparkletts have captured significant market share by engaging in what some would called deceptive advertising. Back in 2007, PepsiCo Inc., which owns the Aquafina 'purified' water brand, announced it would begin printing the words 'Public Water Source' on its labels to ensure that customers knew where Aquafina water actually came from. The move came in response to several nationwide campaigns launched at that time to combat deception in bottled water labeling. "
0," Early-age exposure to the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), a component found in soup and other food can liners, and in some plastics, can increase the possibility of asthma in children. First to report this BPA-exposure and childhood-asthma connection are researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health at the Mailman School of Public Health , with results to be published in the March edition of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology . 'Asthma prevalence has increased dramatically over the past 30 years, which suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered environmental exposures may be implicated. Our study indicates that one such exposure may be BPA,' said lead author Kathleen Donohue, MD, an investigator at the Center for Children's Environmental Health and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . The levels of BPA exposure was measured by taking urine samples from expectant mothers during their third trimester, as well as in the children of the 568 moms at the ages of three, five and seven. A BPA metabolite found in urine acts as an indicator towards the level of exposure. The results indicated that increased risk of asthma and wheezing was linked to the exposure of BPA during the early years of the child's life. Reducing BPA exposure Recommendations from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to reduce exposure to BPA include: avoidance of plastic numbers three and seven. Many include number six in the 'plastics to avoid' category. Also recommended by the NIEHS is to choose glass, porcelain or stainless steel containers over plastic, especially when storing food items in the freezer, or when used for hot foods or liquids. An ABC News report from early 2011 showed a statistic pulled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that '93 percent of Americans have BPA in their bodies,' and suggested to eat fresh produce (as opposed to frozen produce in plastic bags), and to eat in more often (because it's difficult to know how the food is prepped or defrosted in the restaurant kitchen).

0," In a world filled with toxic substances that have ruined the quality of air, water and food, the last thing someone wants to hear is that there may be 'poison' lurking in what would ordinarily be clean, wholesome and nourishing food. However, these poisons do exist in plant life and serve a definite purpose for the health of the plant. The problem occurs when the human physiology is compromised and does not have the ability to neutralize these poisons, which then causes all kinds of despair. So what are these poisons, where do they lurk, who should avoid them, and what can be done to mitigate their effects? Oxalates Oxalates are a plant poison that is naturally found in the roots, leaves, and stems of some of the most nutritious vegetables. Oxalates are like tiny shards of glass with pointy edges that discourage insects from eating the plant. This is not normally harmful to humans as our intestinal microbiota consume them and they are then removed through our stools. However, due to antibiotic use, chronic stress, and diets high in sugar and fat, the delicate bacteria that is the primary consumer of oxalates is wiped out, thereby leaving the intestinal system incapable of handling them safely and effectively. Foods high in oxalates Foods that are high in oxalates include: "
0," According to a National Vaccine Information Center ( http://nvic.org ) MedAlerts blog entry written in November 2010, the incidents of abortion and stillbirth events from the HPV4 vaccine Gardasil supersedes the same event from all other vaccinations. The research and post was written by Steven M. Rubin, Ph.D., a computer scientist who maintains the online searchable VAERS database, MedAlerts. He has managed this database voluntarily and independent of his official work since 2003 and has worked with the NVIC since 2005. In his blog entry on MedAlerts, Dr. Rubin states that 'It has been suggested that the H1N1 Flu vaccine causes miscarriages. This month, I want to see if the claim is supported by VAERS data.' Dr. Rubin explains how it is determined whether a VAERS event resulted in a miscarriage. 'VAERS uses the MedDRA symptom classification, which organizes all known symptoms at five levels of detail. At the second level of detail is an entry 'Abortions and stillbirth' which has under it 'Abortion related conditions and complications', 'Abortions spontaneous', 'Stillbirth and foetal death' and 'Abortions not specified as induced or spontaneous'. Each of these is further refined into specific symptoms. So it seems that this second-level term (or as it is known in MedDRA, the High-Level Group Term or HLGT) is a valid way to identify miscarriages.' He surmised the data would 'surely favor vaccines that have been given for 21 years over those that have been recently introduced, because such vaccines will have been given much more, and so will have produced many more symptoms.' In other words, this graph should de-emphasize the H1N1 Flu vaccine , which has existed for just one year. We should see relatively few H1N1-related miscarriage events compared with the 'seasonal' flu vaccine, which has been administered to many more patients. However, the VAERS data proved him wrong. Dr. Rubin acknowledges the 'results are shocking. First of all, the H1N1 Flu vaccine has appeared in miscarriage events more often than almost any other vaccine.' He goes on to state, 'But the graph has more shocking results for us. The H1N1 Flu vaccine appears in many of the abortion/stillbirth cases, but not the most. The 'winner', appearing in 297 of the VAERS records associated with miscarriage, is Gardasil (vaccine code HPV4)! Once again, this vaccine is a newcomer, having only existed for four years.' His advice to pregnant women is to 'read the product manufacturers insert for the vaccine they are considering and speak with one or more trusted health care professionals before making a decision about vaccination during pregnancy.' A recently released study, New Adjuvanted Vaccines in Pregnancy: What is Known About Their Safety? had this to say: 'Owing to the fact that pregnant women are usually excluded from the majority of clinical trials on vaccines , little is known about the side effects of adjuvants during pregnancy. There are only a few published studies on the safety of adjuvanted vaccines during pregnancy. These studies, however, concentrated on the extreme effects of adjuvanted vaccines on pregnancy (i.e., teratogenic effects). No attention has been paid to more subtle effects, such as effects on placental development or fetal weight or the effects of the vaccine or its adjuvant on the maternal immune system. During normal pregnancy, the maternal immune system adapts to accommodate the semiallogeneic fetus and interference with this immune system may interfere with normal pregnancy.' SANEVax ( http://sanevax.org/ ) is outraged that a vaccine that is a 'relative newcomer' has the highest incident of induced abortions and stillbirth rates among any other vaccine on the market. There is no doubt the vaccines safety and efficacy has not been thoroughly investigated, and independent investigation on the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix must be conducted before there are more injuries and deaths. There is currently no vaccine specifically approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy in the United States. Caveat Emptor - let the buyer beware! It is obvious that the pharmaceutical marketing campaign promises of 'One Less Girl' at risk for cervical cancer and 'armed for life' have turned into a global travesty as each day ONE MORE GIRL suffers an adverse reaction and/or death - or the death of her baby after taking Gardasil or Cervarix.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Enzymes are molecules that act as catalysts for all chemical reactions within the body and are necessary to sustain life. There are two basic categories: digestive enzymes which work in the stomach breaking down food particles before their nutrients can be absorbed, and metabolic (or systemic) enzymes whose primary work begins in the bloodstream digesting foreign debris before traveling to bodily tissues to continue this and other functions. A chronic deficiency of enzymes weakens the immune system, contributes to illness, and ultimately promotes diseases such as cancer. Both enzyme types are produced in the body but are also present in raw foods and through oral supplementation. To achieve and maintain optimum health, an adequate supply of both forms is fundamental. There are twenty-two different types of enzymes produced in the body, primarily by the pancreas, and this production diminishes as we age (1). The three basic digestive enzymes are amylase, lipase, and protease which breakdown carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Additionally, cellulose and lactose break down fiber and dairy. These enzymes work in the stomach during the period of pre-digestion; however, when food is cooked or processed its naturally occurring enzymes are destroyed. Consuming denatured food overburdens the body as it taps into its ever-decreasing enzyme supply in an effort to complete the pre-digestion process. When insufficient pre-digestion occurs, the body produces an excess amount of stomach acid trying to offset the imbalance. This contributes to acid reflux, heartburn, gas, bloating, and malnutrition (even in overweight individuals) due to incomplete digestion. Partially digested proteins putrefy in the intestines forming toxic substances. Once these toxins enter the bloodstream, they weaken the immune system and contribute to many serious health conditions as they accumulate in tissues throughout the body. Consuming raw food, reducing the amount of cooked and processed foods as much as possible, chewing food thoroughly to activate enzymes in saliva, plus regular supplementation of digestive enzymes with meals will help offset the ill effects of an enzyme deficiency. Enzyme-rich food ensures its complete digestion and leaves the body's supplies available for other processes. Complimenting the work of digestive enzymes are metabolic enzymes which facilitate virtually every chemical reaction and cellular function of the body , including cleansing the blood and reducing inflammation throughout the body, among many other vital bodily processes. A deficiency results when metabolic enzymes are diverted for digestion requirements. A weakened immune system due to an unmet enzyme deficiency allows for the accumulation of pathogens (disease causing agents) and carcinogens ( cancer causing substances), and the body's inability to suppress or contain the growth of cancerous cells. Nearly all pathogens, including cancer cells, are protected by a protein-based coating, or 'fibrin', that makes it difficult for the immune system to identify and destroy them. This sticky coating can be up to 15 times thicker than the membrane of normal cells (1,5). This is where metabolic enzymes are needed. The bulk of these enzymes are proteases, or 'protealytic', which means they speed up the breakdown of proteins. In sufficient quantities, they digest the protective fibrin membrane and expose the cancer cells to the immune system. Since the pancreas produces most of the body's enzyme supplies, supplementing with metabolic enzymes assists this often-overworked organ and helps stave off cancer. An ample supply of pancreatic enzymes should be taken orally between meals to ease the body's metabolic burden and conserve its enzyme supplies. Unlike digestive enzymes which are taken with food, metabolic enzymes are taken on an empty stomach to facilitate their entry into the bloodstream. Due to their protein-digesting capabilities and health-enhancing properties, therapeutic doses of metabolic/pancreatic enzymes have been successfully used for decades to help treat cancer. Historically, the case for pancreatic enzymes in cancer therapy was first established in the early 1900s by the Scottish Embryologist John Beard, who observed under the microscope that placenta cells resemble malignant cells as they grow in preparation for the creation of a baby. Observing that the placental tissue stops growing at eight weeks once the fetus' pancreatic enzyme production begins, Beard theorized that a malignant tumor mass would respond likewise provided a sufficient quantity of pancreatic enzymes was supplied (2,3). Beard tested his theories with great success using pancreatic juices to reduce tumors in humans and animals, and these findings were published in his 1911 monograph entitled The Enzyme Therapy of Cancer. His pioneering work was all but forgotten following his death in 1923 until a Texas dentist by the name of William Donald Kelley established a similar theory based on Beard's work nearly forty years later (2,3). Kelley cured himself of advanced pancreatic cancer using a protocol largely reliant on nutrition and mega doses of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. He went on to successfully treat thousands of other 'terminal' cancer patients; but despite his extraordinary achievements, he was ostracized by the medical community who refused (and still refuses) to accept that natural, non-toxic substances are effective treatments against cancer. New York City cancer specialist Nicholas Gonzalez, MD began a case review of Kelley's patients beginning in 1981 while still a med student at Cornell University. This included research into oral pancreatic enzymes for cancer treatment, and eventually led to his own practice utilizing the enzyme approach with advanced cancer patients. He continues to treat his patients with natural therapies and enzymes based on the work of Beard and Kelley (4). Healthy individuals can take small doses of both digestive enzymes with meals and metabolic enzymes on an empty stomach in order to maintain health and prevent a deficiency over time. Pregnant women should always consult a health care provider before beginning a regime of supplementation. For people with serious health challenges it may be best to begin oral enzyme supplementation with small doses, gradually increasing until maximum benefits are felt. Supplementing between meals with as many as 40-60 systemic enzymes as a daily therapeutic dose for cancer patients is not uncommon (3,4,5). A natural health care practitioner can assist in deciding the proper supplement type and dosage. References: 1. Diamond, M.D., W.John, and Cowden, M.D., W.Lee: Cancer Diagnosis, What To Do Next.

0," MarketWatch detailed '10 things the soda business won't tell you' related to the soda pop industry. Most is bad news for pop drinkers. Soda, like beer, for many is an acquired taste. It is something people have to get used to, because as it seems, your body is rejecting it when first introduced. People have witnessed parents giving pop to children who complain of it being painful to drink, with the parents reassuring them, 'don't worry, you'll get used to it.' Perhaps there is one bit of good news to come from the MarketWatch report. Studies show more people are consuming water, even over pop. Perhaps less exciting, many are drinking the water from plastic bottles by companies owned by major pop makers such as Coca-Cola (Dasani owner), PepsiCo (Aquafina owner), and Dr Pepper Snapple (Deja Blue owner). The bad news about pop 1) An increased consumption of sugary beverages like pop, have contributed to the major obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in diabetes sufferers. 'Rising consumption of sugary drinks has been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic, according to a 2012 report published by the Institute of Medicine .' 2) Just because the beverage says 'diet,' studies suggest that it does not mean it is healthy. People apparently still believe it does. 'One recent study by French researchers published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a strong correlation between diet drinks and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.' 3) Energy drinks, and therefore caffeine intake, are on the rise. The FDA places limits on the amount of caffeine allowed in soft drinks, but as of yet there are no such caps for energy drinks . Major pop sellers have a line of energy drinks. It is also suggested that mixing high amounts of caffeine with alcohol creates a dangerous cocktail that has landed many in the emergency room after a night of drinking. 'We're seeing more and more people coming in with these issues, especially young people who are mixing their energy drinks with alcohol,' says Tom Sugarman, emergency physician and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians . 4) Doctors and dentists are accepting money by soda companies, according to a study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest . In addition, the Food Research and Action Center and Feeding America are getting some donations from the beverage companies.

0," It's one of the few victories for the people against an out-of-control federal agency that is growing more lawless and arrogant by the year. As reported by Indian Country Today , the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Department of the Interior (as does the Bureau of Indian Affairs), was forced to cancel an oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine region in northwestern Montana earlier this month, thereby keeping land that is culturally and traditionally sacred to members of the Blackfoot Nation pristine. 'It's a very historic day for the Blackfeet,' said John Murray, the Blackfeet Nation's Historic Preservation Officer, Indian Country Today reported. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, in a statement announcing the decision, said that it was the correct action to take on behalf of the tribe and its future members. 'Today's action honors Badger-Two Medicine's rich cultural and natural resources and recognizes the irreparable impacts that oil and gas development would have on them,' Jewell said. Decision ends all legal wrangling Indian Country Today reported further: The 130,000-acre Badger-Two Medicine region, part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest, is wedged between Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The area is historically, culturally and spiritually significant to the Blackfeet Tribe and is part of a recognized Traditional Cultural District, characteristics that caused Congress to legislatively withdraw the area from mineral development in 2006. 'It's not a wilderness,' said Murray. 'It is a living Blackfeet landscape.' The BLM had issued a 6,200-acre oil and gas lease to Solenex, of Louisiana, under then-Interior Secretary James Watt in 1982, but operations have been in limbo since 1985. BLM since determined that the lease was not properly issued because it violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act, the department said. Jewell's decision came after carefully examining the record and following consultations with the U.S. Forest Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the Blackfeet tribe, the lease-holding company and other concerned parties. A number of ethnographic studies and one archeological study have been done on the tract of land . The BLM decision ends legal attempts by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which was litigating on behalf of Solenex in challenging the Interior Department's Nov. 23 decision to cancel the lease. Every single one of the originally issued leases to the region have undergone a plethora of administrative, legal and legislative actions since they were handed down more than three decades ago due to the significance of the Badger-Two Medicine region and over concerns about circumstances that led to the lease issuance. Refreshing change Indian Country reported that some two-thirds of original leaseholders took advantage of tax incentives that Congress established in exchange for voluntarily relinquishing leases to the region. 'There was only one lease that was subject to the court, but overall there are 18 leases,' Murray said. 'We are hopeful that the rest of them are going to be canceled also.' The BLM has been at the center of various controversies in recent years, more so than in the past. As NewsTarget.com reported earlier this month, the agency that most Americans never heard of made the news when about 200 armed agents in SWAT gear surrounded a Nevada rancher named Cliven Bundy in April 2014 with automatic weapons, helicopters and government snipers. Then in January, a group of armed men led by Ammon Bundy, Cliven Bundy's son, took over a small building on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest terroristic actions taken by the BLM against Western ranchers. As further reported by The Daily Sheeple , BLM agents were caught on video setting fires that became uncontrolled and were left to burn unmonitored around Prince Glenn, Oregon, (not very different from what another ranch family, the Hammonds, were jailed for burning government land). So, to see people actually win a legal battle against BLM and the Interior Department is a refreshing change. Sources: IndianCountryTodayMediaNetwork.com DOJ.gov NewsTarget.com "
0," Tweet New research released today at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology's Annual Meeting found that older Americans may improve their memory by making simple lifestyle changes including memory exercises, physical fitness, healthy eating and stress reduction. The study was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and funded by the Fran and Ray Stark Foundation Fund for Alzheimer's Disease Research, the Judith Olenick Elgart Fund for Research on Brain Aging, and the Parlow-Solomon Professorship on Aging. 'We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people maintain their physical health, which is a key component of healthy aging,' says lead investigator, Gary Small, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, ' But maintaining mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence which suggests that people can preserve their memory by adding memory exercises and stress reduction to this routine.' The study was the first to test the impact of combining memory exercises and stress reduction with a healthy diet and exercise to improve memory. In the 14-day study, subjects with normal baseline memory performance scores were randomly assigned to two groups (sample size of 17 individuals). In the test group, subjects following a memory improvement plan which included: Memory Training Brainteasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises, which emphasized verbal skills, were conducted throughout the day to stimulate the brain. Healthy Diet Participants ate five meals daily, which included a balanced diet rich in omega-3 fats, low-glycemic index carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains) and antioxidants. Eating five small meals throughout the day prevents dips in blood glucose levels and glucose is the primary energy source for the brain. Physical Fitness Brisk daily walks and stretching were done daily to promote physical fitness, which has been found to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Stress Reduction Participants used stretching and relaxation exercises to manage stress. Stress causes the body to release cortisol, which plays an important role in memory preservation. Cortisol can impair memory and has been found to shrink the memory centers in the brain. In the control group, subjects did not make any behavior modifications. Immediately before and after the 14-day study, each participant's brain function was tested using positron emission tomorgraphy (PET) scans to measure activity throughout the brain. After the 14-day study, participants following the memory improvement plan recorded a 5% decrease in brain metabolism in the dorsal lateral prefrontal region of the brain, which is directly linked to working memory and other cognitive functions, suggesting that they were using their brain more efficiently. Furthermore, these subjects reported improved memory, and demonstrated better performance on a cognitive measure controlled by this same brain region. 'Most people do not realize that they are in control of their memory as they get older,' declared Dr. Small, 'But this research demonstrates that it is possible, in just 14 days, to make simple lifestyle changes that will not only improve memory and brain function, but also will improve overall health and wellness.' The next step in this research is to better understand the specific effect of each individual component of the memory improvement plan to determine which combination of healthy lifestyle strategies produces optimal results.

0," On March 24 of this year, I wrote a story entitled Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 now clearly a government cover-up: All evidence contradicts official story. In that story, I wrote: ...it now seems increasingly likely that the Flight 370 aircraft has, indeed, been delivered to a rogue nation where it is being transformed into a weapon. Whoever took control of Flight 370 now has a massive stealth weapon which an incredibly long flight range. This aircraft can now be outfitted with nuclear weapons and dispatched to almost any desirable target anywhere in the world, including cities like New York and Washington D.C., unfortunately. Today, U.S. intelligence officials repeated my warning almost word for word . As Bill Gertz of the Free Beacon is now reporting, 11 commercial airliners have gone missing in Tripoli , and U.S. intelligence officials are now openly warning that those jets could be weaponized to launch terrorism attack on U.S. cities. '...western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa,' reports the Free Beacon. 'Intelligence reports ...included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports. U.S. intelligence warning an almost exact copy of Health Ranger story from March Read that again and you will see that the military intelligence warning is almost a word-for-word description of what I wrote here on selfnews over five months ago , including the exact sequence and names of two U.S. cities. When I first wrote my story earlier this year, I remember being criticized for suggesting such 'wild conspiracy theories.' (Only incredibly stupid people use the phrase 'conspiracy theory' as a flippant condemnation because, of course, all terrorist attacks are conspiracies by definition.) As selfnews readers have since learned, a huge number of things I write about here on selfnews are months or years ahead of their time. They sometimes seem strange or unusual at first glance, but more often than not they turn out to be very credible and almost prophetic. Intelligence officials are concerned about jetliner attacks on 9/11 'The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi,' reports the Free Beacon. There are numerous ways in which a commercial aircraft could be outfitted with weapons and launched against major U.S. cities. I will not detail them here for obvious reasons, but as a qualified aircraft pilot and a high-IQ laboratory director , I can immediately think of at least five specific airborne threat tactics which the U.S. needs to defend against. I hope they've thought of them all and are taking necessary precautions. Although in all seriousness, there are some attack scenarios which are virtually impossible to stop. Aircraft squawk identifiers, for example, can easily be spoofed. That's not any sort of top secret information: every qualified pilot knows this. In nearly all aircraft , in fact, the pilot simply types in whatever squawk code he wants. It's a four-digit code, and '1200' is a generic VFR squawk code used by hundreds of general aviation aircraft on any given day. Unfortunately, an inbound jetliner with evil intent could quite readily request traffic vectors for a large U.S. airport and actually be guided right into the final approach glide slope by air traffic control. I'm not sure there are any security measures in place to detect terror intentions in time to stop the aircraft from deploying weapons above U.S. cities. I do know the U.S. military will scramble fighter jets to escort suspicious aircraft, but even their engagement protocols might actually make things worse in some circumstance. For example, what if the commercial jet is loaded with 'dirty bomb' radioactive waste material? Shooting down the jet would only cause those materials to be dispersed into the air, potentially worsening the incident rather than de-escalating it. As U.S. intelligence authorities no doubt realize, if a flight crew of terrorists is willing to die in order to deliver their weapons, there is not much which can be done to stop them . You can't force an aircraft to land unless you physically shoot out the engines, in which case you are risking a massive explosion of the entire aircraft and whatever might be onboard. Shooting out the engines, after all, will often result in a fiery explosion for the simple reason that all the jet fuel is stored in the wings. And those wings aren't bulletproof. At best, the U.S. military might hope to shoot down an enemy aircraft over a relatively uninhabited area, but such outcomes necessitate early detection and confirmation of the threat. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) MH370 plus 11 more commercial jets are now missing So what we have now is a grand total of 12 large commercial aircraft that have gone missing (that's MH370 plus 11 more that have gone missing from Tripoli). We have terrorist organizations around the world that are openly seeking to destroy America. On top of that, certain nations and terror groups obviously have easy access to weapons materials from several different fronts (biological, chemical, nuclear, etc.). Senior military intelligence believes U.S. cities might be targeted by these weaponized aircraft on September 11. I don't think they have any specific intelligence claiming such attacks will take place, but they recognize the threat (as do I). With twelve jets, twelve U.S. cities could be simultaneously targeted by whatever weapons of mass destruction the terrorists can come up with. If only half of those attacks made it through, a six-city attack would still be absolutely devastating to America (which is what the terrorists want). Because of flight path proximity, the most likely cities to be targeted by terrorists flying commercial jets would reside on the East Coast of the United States. Therefore, it's only logical to conclude that the most likely city targets would include New York, Washington D.C., Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and so on. Be careful on 9/11 Whatever your plans for the next couple of weeks, be cautious on 9/11. This is a date on which terrorists wish to strike America because of the psychological impact of the date. Striking on precisely 9/11 sends a message that the United States can't even stop terrorists on the most likely day of terror. Hopefully nothing bad will happen on 9/11, and I'm not trying to scare anyone away from existing plans. But if you have a choice, you might be wise to consider staying out of East Coast cities on that day, just in case. Or, if you really have to be in the city, double check your own preparedness supplies. Do you have potassium iodide or iodine supplies in case of nuclear terrorism? Do you have a face mask in case of chemical or biological terrorism? Do you have food, water and medicine supplies at home? These are wise things to keep prepared at all times -- but especially so when the likelihood of a terrorism attack is heightened for any reason. Right now, you've got about a week to get prepared before 9/11, just in case. I'm not suggesting anyone panic, but right now would be a good time to double check your preparedness lists and make plans to go out and acquire anything you're missing before the coming weekend. Stay safe by staying prepared for all emergencies Personally, I believe it is only a matter of time before a large U.S. city is hit with a devastating terrorism weapon. I hope and pray such violence never takes place, but I also know that there are horrendously evil people (and nations) in our world, and I know that America has many enemies which are trying to destroy her. I am sending extra prayers to all the crew aboard America's nuclear sub fleet, because those subs stand as the last-ditch defense against global nuclear war. The very fact that we have stealth subs cruising around the oceans, carrying nuclear-tipped ICBMs, is a powerful deterrent to America's enemies. And if we didn't have those subs, we would be in a far worse strategic situation right now. As a person who is 'anti war,' I am also strongly 'pro nuclear submarines' because it is those subs that help prevent wars from taking place by forcing America's enemies to consider the devastating cost of retaliation. Stay safe, everybody. The idea of 12 missing commercial airliners in the hands of terror groups who hate America should be more than enough cause for you to double check your preparedness plans before 9/11. "
0," Unsweetened, raw cocoa powder, the same stuff that is used to make that sinfully delicious 'guilty pleasure' food chocolate, has a multitude of health benefits. They are often overlooked because it is so often incorporated into overly sweetened treats like candy bars. However, the raw powder that is the basis for all of these indulgent treats is surprisingly low in calories, high in fiber, and rich in several potent antioxidants. In fact, when added to some heated skim organic milk and with a touch of stevia sweetener, you've got yourself an antioxidant-packed, delicious, low fat treat. Cocoa contains flavonoids Cocoa flavonoids are a potent source of antioxidants. Flavonoids are plant derived compounds which pursue and kill free radicals. Free radicals cause cell death and mutation, so flavonoids are a potent weapon against cancer. Most plants contain flavonoids in varying concentrations. It is thought that these compounds are one of the primary ways a plant can help heal its wounds and fend off invasive pests. This is probably why they are so useful to the human body's defense mechanisms. Flavonoid content is the primary reason cocoa is such a healthy food. Cocoa in its raw form is very high in these compounds ounce for ounce. Cocoa flavonoids are also thought to inhibit the oxidation of harmful cholesterol. They may lower the likelihood of artery plaque build-up by promoting more efficient circulation. Daily consumption of cocoa powder can help fend off coronary disease, stroke and several types of cancer. Cocoa is rich in theobromine Theobromine is a member of the alkaloid family of phytoechemicals. It is the chemical in cocoa that makes chocolate toxic to cats and dogs as well as some other animals, but of course it is completely harmless to the human body and even has some therapeutic value. This chemical is known for its ability to help lower blood pressure by helping to relax the blood vessels and allow for a more free and unobstructed flow of blood. This action also helps to boost circulation. Theobromine also has stimulant effects similar to caffeine but unlike caffeine, it does not stimulate the central nervous system. Cocoa may protect your skin from UV damage The high antioxidant content of cocoa may not just be healthy for all your internal parts, but it also may be a great anti-aging weapon when it comes to the beauty of your skin. A study found that those who ate 70 percent cocoa content dark chocolate every day for several weeks seemed to have a naturally higher tolerance to UV exposure. After being exposed to UV lamps, they exhibited less skin reddening and appeared to also have less cellular damage than those who had not consumed chocolate or who had consumed the type of chocolate that did not contain high levels of cocoa. Their conclusion was that the cocoa-rich diet contributed to the skin's ability to protect itself against UV damage. Cocoa contains phenylethylamine, a mood boosting chemical Cocoa contains a chemical that is also found in our brain called phenylethylamine. This natural chemical is partly responsible for regulating mood and also may play a role in boosting levels of serotonin, which is one of the most potent 'pleasure' chemicals. This is part of the reason that chocolate is so often viewed as a sweet treat that instantly makes you feel better when you're down. This chemical, combined with the slightly stimulating effects of several of the other constituents found in the cocoa bean are likely the perfect synergy of mood-enhancing elements. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The dairy industry recently formed a Global Dairy Forum to help coordinate dairy research and promote the image of milk products in light of a growing anti-dairy movement that has targeted the industry for its products' negative health effects. At the recent International Dairy Federation summit, the Global Dairy Forum was charged with boosting the image of milk since sales have slowed following anti-dairy campaigns that linked the drink to diseases and disorders. The Forum includes dairy firms such as Arla Foods, Campina, Fonterra and Dairy Farmers of America, and is headed by Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain. Tesco has agreed to get behind a campaign to help educate British consumers about the healthy benefits of drinking milk. The Global Dairy Forum will launch campaigns to increase the presence of milk and dairy products in schools, as well as encourage women drink more milk to boost their consumption of calcium. According to Tesco senior dairy buyer Alain Guilpain, more than 90 percent of consumers are unaware of the fat content of milk, and half of those surveyed in a recent study by the Milk Development Council overestimated the fat content by more than six times. 'By getting the right information out there, we can dispel these misconceptions and alert a new generation of drinkers to milk's unique health properties,' Guilpain said. However, milk opponents claim the dairy industry's new forum will push misleading milk information on the public, possibly exacerbating health problems for many consumers. According to consumer advocate Mike Adams, milk consumption is linked with constipation, sinusitis, digestive disorders and heart disease. 'The dairy industry is working hard to convince humans that a beverage that is nutritionally formulated for baby cows should be routinely consumed by adult human beings,' Adams said. 'This requires a lot of marketing dollars and a continued campaign of propaganda.' The dairy industry says milk is a key dietary source of calcium, which can help prevent brittle bones. A survey last year revealed that 70 to 80 percent of British children 11 to 18 years old consumed less than their RDA of calcium. ### "
0," It is becoming extremely difficult to distinguish some parts of American cities from overseas war zones as the number of people cut down by gunfire in these cities continues to climb. Over the recent Memorial Day holiday, for example, nine people were killed and scores more were wounded in what became part of the deadliest month for the violent city of Baltimore in some 15 years. In Chicago, meanwhile, 12 people were killed and 43 wounded in various shooting incidents; among the dead was a four-year-old girl. In New York City, where crime had fallen dramatically under recent administrations, residents of Manhattan are now 45 percent more likely to be killed under the current administration of socialist Mayor Bill DeBlasio. Fewer guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens leads to more crime As reported by The New York Post on May 26: Sixteen people were killed around the borough between the first of the year and Sunday. Over the same period last year, the figure was 11. That's an increase of about 45 percent. Shootings in the borough have also soared. There have been 50 'shooting incidents' since Jan. 1, compared with 31 in the same time period in 2014 an increase of about 38 percent. Some of these 'incidents' involved more than one victim. The number of shooting victims nearly doubled, from 33 to 61. What are some common elements in all of these cases? Is it because there aren't enough police on the streets? Is it because a culture of violence exists among inner-city youth? Is it because of liberal public policies that promote dependence, penalize two-parent families, and minimize the importance of personal responsibility? All of this is true, but one glaring point needs to be made regarding violence in these cities and all other American cities around the country: despite the Second Amendment's clear language acknowledging our right to keep and bear arms, the cities with the most violence are those with strict gun control laws that essentially prohibit residents from defending themselves adequately. Some people will be tempted to counter by arguing that putting more firearms into cities with too much gun violence already is lunacy. However, that position, as always, ignores some realities, namely that gun control laws are obviously not working, efforts to keep guns out of the hands of those who are not legally permitted to own them are failing, and law-abiding people are being made more vulnerable for no good reason. Murder capitals do not become murder capitals by accident. They are generally the result of a combination of factors including public policy, political ideology and socioeconomic conditions. Doing the same things over and over again Consider the three cities mentioned above and the point will be proven. In the case of Baltimore, the dramatic rise in violence comes after an incident in which local police have already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion for the alleged murder of a crime suspect, Freddie Gray. Following the indictment of six officers in what many view as a politically motivated effort because it was handed down before all of the evidence was thoroughly examined by a grand jury, police decided to back off and make fewer arrests out of fear of persecution. This resulted in an instant crime wave. In the case of Chicago, parts of that city's South Side have been a war zone for years now. The administration of Mayor Rahm Emanuel has done nothing to improve conditions; the murder rate in 2014 skyrocketed to the highest levels since 1965 . No major policy changes mean nothing changes on the street, either. In New York, by comparison, some direct policy changes initiated by de Blasio are being directly linked to the increase in murder and violent crime. Upon entering office, de Blasio all but ended 'stop and frisk' procedures, which former NYPD chiefs have praised as both legal and necessary. The proof, they say, is in NYC's dramatic drop in violent crime between 1970 and his election just a few years ago. A lack of political will, the tendency to double down on progressive policies that only deepen the problem, and the insistence on preventing law-abiding Americans from being victimized will only make America's war zones even more deadly.

0," Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the couple accused of murdering 14 people at a holiday work party in San Bernardino, had also planned to blow up vehicles on crowded Southern California freeways, claim officials investigating this highly publicized case of domestic terrorism. Syed Rizwan Farook had allegedly been planning a massive terrorist attack on California's often congested 91 Freeway along with his childhood friend Enrique Marquez. The two had been scheming to unleash a 'nightmare' scenario using guns, pipe bombs and other weapons to murder innocent Americans. Officials claim Farook and his buddy mapped out the 91 Freeway in precise detail, pinpointing spots of congestion where they would best be able to inflict maximum carnage. The duo had collected an arsenal of weapons and explosives in 2011 that they planned to use in the attack, which they later abandoned in 2012. A criminal complaint filed in federal court accuses Marquez and Farook of identifying areas of the 91 Freeway without exits, where they intended to stand from nearby hills and chuck pipe bombs into oncoming traffic. The disruption would immediately halt traffic, then allowing the duo to shoot at motorists. Marquez is also being accused of plotting another similar terrorist attack at nearby Riverside City College, which is just a stone's throw away from the location where the San Bernardino attacks occurred. 'Ambushes in narrow passages with no escape routes have long been a staple of warcraft,' wrote Richard Winton for the Los Angeles Times about the alleged plot. 'Such tactics have been used in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. military convoys have been hit with improvised explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire.' Government, media upping the terrorist game to instill more fear in Americans With the U.S. government chomping at the bit to launch full-scale war in Syria , it's only too convenient that Middle Eastern Islamists would suddenly choose December to randomly attack their co-workers at a holiday party. It's just the thing Americans need to hear during this time of year to accept more war, more government surveillance and more loss of civil liberties. And now with the sudden news that these same Islamists had also supposedly been planning to interfere with another thing near and dear to the hearts of many Americans driving the propagandists have just about sealed the deal. Fear, of course, is what drives people to give up their freedoms in exchange for a false perception of safety and security . 'Terrorists are constantly looking for ways of not only hitting people at large symbolic targets and events, but also during everyday routine activities as well, where civilians are most vulnerable and least able to escape,' stated Brian Levin, a professor at California State University in San Bernardino , to the LA Times . 'Transportation targets are fairly common with terrorists, but they usually involve mass transit, aircraft or bridges. A horrendous operation such as the one envisioned in the complaint not only confines civilians while they would be under vicious attack but obstructs and places first responders at risk from sniper fire as well.' Such fear-mongering comes as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recently announced that it's phasing out the 'opt-out' option at U.S. airports , which will force nearly all Americans who wish to fly to walk through naked body scanners and be blasted with cancer-causing radiation. If not for the constant threat of terrorism on airplanes, at school, at work and now (supposedly) on highways, these and other incremental destructions of civil liberties probably wouldn't fly with many Americans. But fear changes everything, and fear is exactly the tool being used to soften the blow of tyrannical fascism that's creeping into nearly every crevice of American life . "
0," Tweet Ever thought about your workplace as being somewhere that you could get fit and lose weight? Most people don't, given that traditional offices are cubicles with artificial light that don't encourage physical movement other than dashing to the next meeting. But some companies, such as Sprint, are starting to create work environments that encourage walking, fitness, and exercise. Sprint has a new campus in Overland Park, Kansas, that helps people lose weight. It encourages them to walk from the parking lot to their buildings and even engage in more frequent strolls throughout the 200 acre campus. It's all part of a growing movement where employers are finding that it pays off to help make their employees more healthy. I think this trend is accelerating and will prove to be a very smart trend, both in terms of employee health and productivity, but also in payoffs for the employers. Allow me explain why. I've often said there's no such thing as mental health without physical health first, and I think this is especially relevant to the work environment. A person who suffers from physical health problems automatically has a diminished capacity for mental performance. I know that some people would argue with that, but in fact, a tremendous amount of evidence shows that body and mind are inseparable when it comes to health, and certainly outstanding nutrition, physical exercise, consumption of superfoods, and avoidance of certain food ingredients is well-known to enhance and support healthy brain function. So, when an employer can make it convenient for employees to be healthier, that employer also receives a reward in terms of productivity and more capable employees. But the employee receives the biggest reward -- their own health. Because when an employee is healthy, they feel better about themselves, and they enjoy working more. Unfortunately, so many of the workplaces in the United States and around the world are places that destroy human health. They use recirculated air, artificial fluorescent lighting, and fundamentally flawed designs of layout that stagnate creativity and essentially suppress the work of employees. In my own offices at Arial Software, I was able to get full-spectrum lighting installed, and was able to choose an office suite that brings in a large amount of natural light. So I'm one of those company CEOs that always looks out for the health interests of its employees and team members, but most companies aren't like that. They're far more interested in cutting costs than in providing natural light and healthy options for their employees. The use of natural light can make a huge difference, not only in employee productivity, but also their attendance. When you bring in natural sunlight, you automatically help prevent clinical depression among your employee base. You will prevent osteoporosis and even help prevent breast cancer and prostate cancer in your employees. That's because natural sunlight is such a powerful healer -- in fact, I consider it an essential nutrient for human health. Employers would do well to bring in more natural sunlight into their buildings, even if they're only looking out for their own financial interests. Investing in natural lighting pays off. What we really need in this country is a revolution in terms of the employer/employee relationships. In the past few decades, this has often been an adversarial relationship, where an employer viewed any benefit or enhancement to employees as being something that was a financial penalty to the employer. It was a win/lose situation. If we're going to fight obesity and prevent chronic disease in this nation, we're going to have to look at the workplace and initiate a changes in our culture where employers take on some responsibility for providing healthy options for their employees. I look at Japan, where many companies begin their day with a physical warm-up and stretching routine. In the United States we might think this is silly, but in fact the Japanese have it right: this kind of morning warm-up and flexibility habit results in enhanced health among the employees. In the United States, however, too many people just lumber into their office chairs, then sit there in front of their computers for 8 hours a day, munching on snack foods and junk foods, then wondering why they go home and have all these health problems such as obesity or carpal tunnel syndrome. Well the answer is they're not engaging in healthy activities at work. So, the employer can make a huge difference here by encouraging employees to get out and take a walk, take a break, or get some natural sunlight on their skin. They can also provide options in terms of healthy nutrition by offering fruits and vegetables for employees to eat and making sure that there are no vending machines nearby that offer unhealthy processed foods or soft drinks. Instead, employees can be given options like juice drinks, bottled water, or fresh fruits and vegetables brought in on a daily basis. I realize this is more expensive up front for the employer, but once again, the investment in your employees' health is more than enough justification for these upfront expenses. Let's face it: Americans spend 1/3 of their lives or more at their workplace. As a result, the workplace is a major influencing factor on the health of all Americans, and it is the workplace where we need to start making some long-term changes that support optimum health and prevent chronic disease.

0," While the Central Intelligence Agency has a history of paying off petty tyrants and thugs in its quest to keep America safe, no regular federal agency would purposely seek out and hire the dregs of society. Right ? Wrong. Enter the illustrious Transportation Security Administration . Are you surprised? According to 'Rob,' a TSA supervisor-turned-whistleblower, in an interview with the Alex Jones Show , the agency's brass is directing staff to hire degenerates - people with criminal records who have exhibited violent tendencies and psychopathic behavior. How do you like air travel now? During the interview, Rob talked about his job, which entailed filing reports on TSA screeners who did not follow agency procedures. He said he was alarmed by the fact that the agency was hiring a number of criminals who he said exhibited the behavior of 'psychopaths.' 'We have a program in the state of Rhode Island where we take prisoners who are out for non-violent drug offenses and everything else - basically sociopaths - and we're sending them to a ten-day course and getting them in uniform checking out people,' the whistleblower said. He noted that people who presented themselves very professionally were often passed over in favor of applicants who had spent time in jail and who had megalomaniacal, power-trip tendencies. The aberrancy is getting noticed 'If they have a background and it's something like violence or abusing authority we put them right in, we put them guys on the floor first day,' said Rob, who also said he was encouraged to hire veterans from the Iraq war who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 'It's all about the power trip, it's all about having people bug their eyes out at the public and getting the public conditioned to the fact that the police state is coming,' Rob said, adding that TSA screeners were instructed to stick out their chests in arrogance and 'eyeball people.' The TSA's bizarre behavior, as well as the agency's lower-than-low hiring standards, is getting noticed by more and more people. Fortunately for all Americans, an increasing number of those are people who can do something about it (let's hope they do). Take a recent report about the TSA by U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. In it she highlighted the fact that TSA agents engage in criminal behavior so often it's almost routine. She says that's no aberrancy, it's because of 'TSA's hiring practices and insufficient use of background checks.' 'This report details highly disturbing cases where pedophiles and child pornographers wearing federal law enforcement uniforms are not only patting down unsuspecting travelers, but in many cases stealing valuables from their bags,' she told a local news station in early June. 'Enough is enough. It's time for Congress to step in and demand accountability from Administrator [John] Pistole.' But what should Americans expect? Criminal risk-based organization? The TSA's recruitment policy does not reflect its own mantra, which is that it was created as an 'intelligent risk-based organization.' The agency doesn't conduct criminal and background checks on many of its employees, Blackburn's report noted, and that it trolls for employees by advertising 'for employment at the Washington Reagan National Airport on pizza boxes and on advertisements above pumps at discount gas stations in the D.C. area.' Rob also told Alex Jones that TSA screeners were being ordered by supervisors to check bags of people who were only coming to the airport to pick up a traveler. He said he was once directed to search a diaper bag that belonged to a woman who had only come to the airport to pick up her husband. A little much? 'We're doing patrols in the parking lot with dogs, we're even going as far out to the train station because the train station is connected to the airport here and we have guys walking around the train station, walking around the rental cars, we're inspecting cars coming into the parking garage, I mean we've fully expanded - we're no longer just at the gate and just at the security checkpoint,' he said, adding that supervisors were firing agents who refused to grope travelers in certain areas. Rob, the report noted, was contacted by his bosses shortly after the interview and reprimanded, by the way. Sources: http://www.infowars.com http://www.prisonplanet.com www.selfnews.com/TSA.html "
0," Widespread consumer demand for plastic products that are free of the hormone-disrupting chemical bisphenol-A (BPA) has led to some significant positive changes in the way that food, beverage and water containers are manufactured. But a new study out of Germany has found that thousands of other potentially harmful chemicals are still leeching from plastic products into food and beverages, including an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) known as di(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate, or DEHF, that is completely unregulated. Martin Wagner and his colleague, Jorg Oehlmann, from the Goethe University Frankfurt, in conjunction with a team of researchers from the German Federal Institute of Hydrology, learned this after conducting tests on 18 different bottled water products to look for the presence of EDCs. Using an advanced combination of bioassay work and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the team identified some 24,520 different chemicals present in the tested water. But of major concern, and the apparent underpinning of the study's findings, was DEHF, a plasticizer chemical that is used to make plastic bottles more flexible. According to reports, DEHF was clearly identified in the tested water as the most consistent and obvious culprit causing anti-estrogenic activity. Despite trace amounts of more than 24,000 other potentially damaging chemicals, DEHF stood out as the only possible EDC capable of inducing this particular observed activity, a highly concerning observation. The study's published abstract explains that 13 of the 18 bottled water products tested exhibited 'significant' anti-estrogenic activity, while 16 of the 18 samples were found to inhibit the body's androgen receptors by an astounding 90 percent. Additionally, the other 24,520 chemical traces besides DEHF were also identified as exhibiting antagonistic activity, which means that they, too, are detrimental to the body's hormonal system. Many thousands of endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in plastic production prove material unsafe But DEHF is apparently not alone in causing significant damage to the endocrine system, as the team was unable to identify this chemical as being specifically anti-androgenic. What this suggests is that there is some other chemical, or chemical combination, being leeched into bottled water that is interfering with the body's chemical signaling system, which is, of course, responsible for hormone production and use within the body. 'We confirmed the identity and biological activity of DEHF and additional isomers of dioctyl fumarate and maleate using authentic standards,' report the researchers. 'Since DEHF is anti-estrogenic but not anti-androgenic we conclude that additional, yet unidentified EDCs must contribute to the antagonistic effect of bottled water.' So while these specific findings concerning DEHF are groundbreaking, the overall conclusion to be drawn from this research is that far more study is needed to determine the types of chemicals that are being leeched from plastic into our food and water, not to mention the extent of this leeching. And since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the rest of the three-letter government agencies will surely never get around to conducting this important research, independent science will simply have to take up the charge. 'This work is a 'tour de force' in identification of endocrine disruptors in packaged materials,' says Bruce Blumberg from the University of California, Irvine, as quoted by Chemistry World . This type of analysis, he adds, 'will be very important for our future understanding of what chemicals we are routinely exposed to and which of these pose hazards of being endocrine disruptors.' You can read the full study abstract here: http://www.plosone.org In the meantime, conscious consumers can avoid plastic containers whenever possible and simply use glass or steel containers instead to avoid these unknown risks.

0," Conventional medical doctors around the world (and the drug companies that support them) want all children to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, HPV, chicken pox and literally over a hundred other diseases. Bill Gates even supports the effort to 'eradicate' disease from our planet by vaccinating people in developing nations. It all sounds like a noble goal, but like any such effort, it is based on an assumption. Upon closer inspection, that assumption turns out to be nothing more than blatant quacksterism hidden behind the technical jargon of modern medicine. What assumption am I referring to? The assumption that immune system intervention (vaccines) produces a better long-term result than immune system adaptation (allowing the person to conquer such infections on their own). At first, it may seem like a no-brainer: Of course it's better to not get infected! Or, at least, that's the conclusion most doctors jump to without any real thought on the subject. In their minds, immune system intervention is obviously superior to immune system adaptation. And in fact they dismiss anyone who dares question this wisdom of modern vaccines. But is this assumption really true? In other words, is it true from a scientific perspective? Do mass vaccinations for non-fatal diseases actually improve the health and lives of those who receive them? Vaccines don't stand up to scientific scrutiny I realize it may seem odd to invoke the laws of scientific reasoning on this issue. Vaccinations are supposed to be accepted without reason, without question by both medical professional and the public, right? Even daring to question vaccines is akin to questioning Darwinism in the minds of many. But this, of course, reveals the fatal flaw of the pro-vaccine gang: They are afraid of being questioned. They fear scientific scrutiny so much that they have to reframe the entire debate as one made up of 'doctors vs. quacks' rather than one of scientific evidence (which they don't have) vs. quackery (which they have lots of). This is the strategy of the intellectually desperate. Truth does not fear investigation, and if vaccines are so provably useful for enhancing the health of children, then doctors shouldn't mind people asking questions or even openly debating the merits of vaccination programs. And yet what you see with vaccines today is a cult-like worship of vaccines that despises scrutiny or even solid science. Vaccines are good because they tell us so, and that should be sufficient reason, we're told. Is it their authority that makes vaccines 'scientific,' not actually any real science. So much for the scientific method when it comes to medicine, huh? Mild infections actually IMPROVE health Meanwhile, new research is showing that human health improves when it is EXPOSED to full-strength pathogens and infections that force the body to activate an adaptive response. For example, new research conducted at Nottingham University (in the UK) is studying whether infecting patients with microscopic parasites (hookworms) actually improves their body's ability to deal with multiple sclerosis. A pioneering study in Argentina showed positive results for asthma patients, demonstrating that hookworm infections invoke a healthy adaptive response in the body that tends to tame asthma. In fact, as this Telegraph story explains ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews... ), one of the primary reasons why so many first-world citizens are getting sick with degenerative disease these days may be that people aren't exposed to enough infections in their lives. This 'hygiene hypothesis' challenges the conventional wisdom of vaccinations, which instead believes that the human body should be denied the experience of a full-strength infection (and the adaptive response that follows). It is the odd belief of vaccine promoters, in other words, that the human body is inherently incapable of dealing with infections and must be protected through chemical intervention. This deeply-rooted lack of faith in the technology of the human body is a bedrock belief of western medicine, which prefers intervention over self care (and external solutions instead of internal ones). By sheer coincidence, this core belief also happens to maximize the profits of the drug companies and conventional medical practitioners who thrive on the revenues created through medical intervention. The upshot of all this is the sobering realization that children need to play in the dirt . Eating a piece of food you drop on the floor won't kill you (the five-second rule!), and there IS such as thing as being 'too clean.' RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Are people trying to live like the Bubble Boy? The public's strange fascination with anti-bacterial soaps (which have been widely shown to actually promote superbug populations) ( http://www.selfnews.com/022178.html ), antibiotics and vaccines shows a remarkable fear of the real world, as if people are seeking to hide inside sterilized plastic bubbles, free from the scary germs of the world. Doctors prey upon this fear by scaring parents into thinking their child might die if they don't get them vaccinated. The germs of the world are to be feared, doctors say, not embraced. Modern medicine's 'War on Germs' is a lot like George Bush's 'War on Terror.' It's a never-ending war against an imaginary opponent, used primarily to control people into doing what you want. But I say this theory is fundamentally flawed. It is based on what seems to be obvious, but in truth is far more complex. It SEEMS that protecting children from chicken pox, for example, is good for them, but in reality that intervention deprives their immune systems of the adaptive response necessary to protect against future, more serious infections. An immune system , much like a musculoskeletal system, needs exercise to stay strong. When denied exposure to real pathogens, it becomes weak and lazy, depriving the person of the immune system experience needed to mature and adapt. A child deprived of chicken pox today is far more likely to be stricken by other infectious diseases in the future -- diseases for which effective vaccines will never exist. And thus the entire belief system upon which vaccinations are based appears to be fundamentally flawed when considering non-fatal infections . I'm not arguing that a person working in a biohazard facility shouldn't be vaccinated against Ebola or Marburg or other extremely deadly virulent strains. There is no healthy adaptive response to such aggressive, dangerous pathogens. But neither are such deadly strains any real risk to the public: They kill their victims too quickly to successfully spread throughout the population. As any CDC official will tell you, the most widespread strains of infectious disease are the weakest strains because they can live in hosts and incubate for long enough to be transmitted to others. Children should not be vaccinated against these largely non-fatal pathogens that actually serve an important function in the maturation of that child's immune system technology. One child, one thousand vaccines Today, we are over-vaccinating our children to the point of utterly ridiculousness, and some doctors are claiming the effort should be boosted to include even as many as 'one thousand vaccines.' The more, the merrier! And yet this vaccination agenda, upon closer inspection, appears to be based entirely on an irrational belief in vaccines rather than a scientifically-proven benefit derived from the intervention. Science, in fact, isn't even allowed in this debate. Opponents of vaccines are screamed right out of the room before they can even raise a single point of objection. The only science they can really quote concerns whether or not the child's body develops antibodies following the vaccine injection. This is an incredibly short-sighted view that completely disregards the long-term consequences of this immune system intervention. Then again, such short-sighted views characterize modern medicine, which essentially ignores the long-term effects of practically everything it promotes: Vaccines, pharmaceuticals, chemotherapy, radiation treatments and so on. When science becomes gospel, it is no longer science, but just another religion framed in a different jargon. There's nothing wrong with religion, of course, but when vaccine-pushing scientists dismiss religion as being 'unscientific' and then resort to precisely the same strategy of faith-based pronouncements of truth in their own work, they only demonstrate the irrational double standard upon which their agenda is based. Vaccines are not to be questioned, period. And anyone who questions them shall be interrogated by the Church of Modern Medicine. I wonder if the ghosts of Copernicus and Galileo might have a few words to say about that? Modern medicine has become to real science what the Church of the year 1633 was to Galileo ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei ). The Scientific Revolution unleashed by those great minds of human history has now been all but abandoned by pushers of pharmaceutical profits at the expense of human health. Vaccines fail every scientific test of long-term safety or even efficacy, and yet they continue to be pushed as gospel by believers in the chemical interventions of modern medicine. To call them quacks as actually missing the point. They are not actually knowingly committing fraud. Most of these doctors and health authorities actually believe what they're doing is right. And therein lies the greater danger -- they are cult-like believers in a system of treatment that defies scientific questioning. In their minds, the vaccine theory is beyond questioning. It is gospel. It is truth. And those who dare question it are, in their minds, lunatics from the start. These are the obvious signs of modern medicine's dangerous descent into medical fanaticism . Vaccine promoters are, in every way, fanatically dedicated to their irrational beliefs that intervening in the immune system in better than allowing the immune system to do its job. And if you break this down to the essential underlying concepts, here's what it all really means: Doctors believe that THEIR technology is superior to the technology of the human immune system . Arrogance, in other words. Man is smarter than Mother Nature. Chemicals are superior to the body's own immune system nanotechnology. These beliefs characterize the gospel of modern medicine, and they simultaneously reveal a highly pessimistic view of Mother Nature. Darwinism, Natural Selection and the fatal contradiction in western medical philosophy One reason this is all so fascinating is because virtually all vaccine pushers also believe in Darwinism and the laws of natural selection . Those very laws dictate that, over hundreds of thousands of years of mutation and natural selection, nature would have chosen the most fit and most biologically advanced members of the human race to survive and pass on their genes. Thus, the human beings that survived to today are, by their own definition of natural selection, the most advanced forms of life possible within the species. We are the cream of the crop, the super-fit humans who survived while our lesser-qualified peers died and disappeared from the gene pool. And yet, all of a sudden, by pushing vaccines, these same doctors are admitting they have NO faith in the technology of the very human beings they claim are genetically superior thanks to natural selection! This simple example exposes the flawed philosophy of western medical scientists and doctors. Their ideas simply don't add up. Are humans genetically superior survivors possessing top-class immune system technology derived from millennia of natural selection? Or are they chemically-deficient, immune-suppressed failures of immune system technology that warrant aggressive pharmaceutical intervention? Vaccine pushers want to have it both ways. They want you to believe your immune system is the technical equivalent of a biological supercomputer, created by countless mutations that selected for superior beings. But if you walk into a doctor's office and tell them you're a superior being with a highly advanced immune system based on hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, they'll jab you with a vaccine anyway, because they actually don't believe human beings possess any advanced immune system technology at all. You cannot believe in Natural Selection and vaccines at the same time. Not without holding a bizarre contradiction in your own head. Then again, modern medicine is a comedy of contradiction. And why should we expect anything different from these geniuses when it comes to the vaccine question? Whether doctors, or students or priests, those who do not question their own beliefs are doomed to fanaticism in all its various forms. The vaccine-pushing agenda of modern times is, in every way, a form of runaway medical fanaticism full of contradiction. My own beliefs on this issue make a lot more sense: Mother Nature produces amazing technology, and the human immune system is one of the most advanced biological supercomputers that has ever existed on our planet . That immune system, when properly supported, can easily overcome common infections. Vaccines are not merely unnecessary; they are a chemical assault that damages the immune system and interferes with the immune technology that should be embraced, not hijacked. I trust Mother Nature's technology over the interventions of profit-minded doctors and drug companies, and I dismiss modern medicine's view of the human body as being ridiculously pessimistic. Modern doctors are, in a very real sense, biological 'doom and gloomers' who want you to believe that, without their expensive interventions, you're doomed to die of disease. And that's just plain bunk.

0," Residents of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, have complained about a state program to spread sewage sludge on public lands near their homes, citing health concerns. The treated sewage sludge, formally known as 'biosolids,' is intended to enrich the soil and help vegetation regrow on the site of a former strip mine that has been turned into a state game reserve. A New York waste management company has received a permit to dispose of biosolids on 50 acres of Pennsylvania state land without paying any disposal fee. Local residents such as Brian Gould, 30, who recently built a house on property abutting the game lands, have expressed concerns about the health effects of spreading treated sewage next to their homes. 'Whenever they spread it, the valley fills in with a fog,' Gould said. 'We're at the highest point around. The wind is always blowing. Whatever they spread up here is going to be carried all around.' 'It smells like if you took 40 Porta-Johns and kicked them over in July,' he said. 'And that's being nice.' Gould's wife, Allison, recently told game officials that, when the spreading began, she was hospitalized with bronchial spasms, which feel like a heart attack. The doctor told her that such spasms can be triggered by airborne pollutants. 'I'm 27. I've never had asthma or any respiratory problems,' she said. 'But that night, I had an elephant sitting on my chest. ... What is this stuff going to do to our families, to our kids?' Residents confront game officials At a recent town meeting, roughly 100 residents confronted officials of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which is responsible for the program. 'The people here pay your wages, and we don't want it,' shouted Bell Township Supervisor Dave Kauffman. 'Pull the permits!' Although state Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Daniel Spadoni assured residents that the biosolids site has been inspected five times with no violations found, residents said that they have been suffering from chronic headaches and nausea. 'It can't be good for you,' said Ryan Smith, 32. 'I mean, it smells like dead animals. You can sit in our living room and feel like you're eating it.' Many residents , including the Goulds, are testing their water to establish a baseline against future contamination, and Mahaffey Fire Chief Dan Wright announced at the meeting that he will refuse to dispatch firefighters to any fires that break out too close to the sludge. 'You can't guarantee it's safe, so I won't send them in,' he said, standing and jabbing his finger at the game officials. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows for the application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club warn that biosolids may contain pollutants and disease-causing contaminants that can cause both short- and long-term harm to humans, animals and the environment. For example, contaminants could leach into nearby wells and groundwater. 'Biosolids is a euphemism for sewage sludge,' said Tom Richard, director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment. 'Before we started spreading them on our land, we used to put them in landfills and dump them in the ocean. That didn't work out so well, because some of it would wash up on the shores of New Jersey, and people didn't like that.' Richard noted that, while EPA tests have indicated that the health risks from biosolids are 'low,' it would be deceptive to claim that biosolids are completely safe. 'Unfortunately low is not zero,' he said. 'It's not zero risk for all the things they've tested, for heavy metals, pathogens, etc. Anyone who tells you it's zero risk doesn't understand the way the risk analysis was conducted.' "
0," The CDC has it right in declaring lack of sleep a public health epidemic. Lack of sleep has been linked to a number of public issues such as industrial disasters, medical and occupational errors, and motor vehicle accidents. In addition to these well-known consequences, however, new studies have shown that people who receive insufficient sleep are at increased risk for chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and even cancer. Research backs the call for better sleep with shocking statistics Two recent studies have shown that unhealthy sleep behaviors and self-reported sleep difficulties are becoming more prevalent across the country, and insufficient sleep is becoming of increasing concern. According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey , 35% of the nearly 75,000 adults who responded received less than seven hours per night. A number of other health problems were also reported, including 38% of respondents reporting that they fell asleep unintentionally during the day at least once during the preceding month. An alarming 4.7 percent nodded off while driving. This is especially concerning when you consider that drowsy driving accounts for at least 1550 fatalities and 40,000 traffic accident injuries each year. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Sleep Disorders Questionnaire , adults between the ages of 40-59 are most likely to get less than eight hours of sleep at 40.3 percent, with the ages of 20-39 not far behind at 37 percent. Furthermore, those adults who did report getting less than seven hours of sleep per night also experienced more difficulties with performing daily tasks. How much sleep is necessary? According to the National Institutes of Health, school-age children need a minimum of 10 hours of sleep per day, while teenagers need around nine hours. Adults need at least seven hours. Unfortunately, the National Health Interview Survey finds that nearly 30 percent of adults get less than six hours of sleep per night on average. Only 31 percent of high school students receive eight hours of sleep on an average school night. There are a number of ways for both adults and children to improve their sleep habits, known as sleep hygiene. First, try to go to bed at the same time each day. Likewise, set an alarm to ensure you rise at the same time every morning. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed can both make falling asleep easier and improve the quality of your sleep, as will avoiding nicotine. While a small bedtime snack is okay, it's best to avoid eating a large meal. For many with busy minds, sleep hygiene falls short Indeed, practicing good sleep hygiene does NOT mean that your busy head calms down when you hop into bed. If you really want to sleep like a baby, then you've got to find a way to turn off all the inner commotion. What causes the mental commotion that you can't just turn off? Fascinating research as reported in the March 2010 issue of Scientific American Magazine suggests that the brain's Default Mode Network (DMN) is the culprit. Scientific American positioned the DMN as the brain's dark energy . The DMN is responsible for self-referential thoughts (autopilot thinking). When the DMN is overactive, your mind churns and spins, generating thoughts that keep you tense and awake. Most people have never heard of the DMN, much less how to turn it off. You can, in fact, turn off your DMN, clear your head and relax. This has been proven via fMRI scans. It's relatively easy to do and it leads to natural sleep when you are tired.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) With every beat of the heart, subtle vibrations are sent through the body, the movement stimulating a higher degree of circulation and a higher level of overall health. Because this movement is conducive to achieving a healthier circulatory system, among others, it has been recreated throughout the cultures and ages of history in an attempt to heal illnesses and improve the overall quality of life. A practice that has been utilized for thousands of years, vibration exercise is said to amplify the effects of the vibrations made each time the heart beats. These vibrations produce a level of blood flow that is uninterrupted, allowing oxygen and other important substances to circulate freely. By constantly pumping blood through the many systems of the body, the modern vibration exercise machine also promotes the drainage of the lymphatic system, which acts as a network of pipes that pushes toxins out of the body. Moving the various fluids of the body requires power, which is only achieved through muscle contractions (such as the contraction of the heart when it pumps). The vibrations created by a vibration exercise machine create small muscular contractions. This forces the fluids through the body in a way that is efficient, constant, and gentle enough not to cause any harm while being forceful enough to discard toxins and other potentially dangerous buildup. Individuals that cannot get rid of their toxins are more prone to illness and do not feel as healthy as those whose lymphatic systems are capable of draining regularly. Exercise is certainly one way to achieve a high level of lymphatic draining, but not everyone has the ability (either physically or practically) to indulge in a great deal of physical activity. For this reason, whole body vibration, facilitated by a machine, is able to help combat the effects of a sedentary lifestyle and rid the body of the toxins that it has stored. This being said, individuals that don't have time for extensive exercise can greatly benefit from whole body vibration. In addition to acting as a catalyst for lymphatic drainage, a vibration exercise machine also sparks the activity of the lymph nodes, which are key components of the immune system. Therefore, the movement allows individuals to both rid their bodies of toxins that they already possess and prevent them from contracting illnesses from new ones. Another benefit, which many individuals enjoy, is weight loss. Though the loss is not drastic, using a vibration exercise machine allows the lymphatic system to push stored fats out of the body, resulting in a healthier, leaner figure. This smaller figure can also be attributed to the decrease in cortisol, which is a known agent of belly fat, due to an increase in serotonin. The benefits of vibration exercise, particularly to the lymphatic system, have been enjoyed by people from several cultures over thousands of years. Modern medicine will most likely continue to study this technique and analyze its many effects on the body, but as the research is conducted individuals will continue to utilize the therapy and take advantage of their healthier circulatory and lymphatic systems.

0," On January 17, 1995, an article written by Beatrice Dexter about the benefits of honey and cinnamon powder, appeared in The Weekly World News. Please allow me to preface this article with a bit of information unbeknown to the writer and virtually everyone else: cinnamon is 26 percent sulfur based and honey is 33 percent sulfur based, making their combination 59 percent sulfur based and the reason why their combination is so effective. Honey is the only food on the planet that will not spoil or rot. Honey will crystallize if it is left in a cool dark place for the long time, but do not mistake this crystallization for it turning into sugar. Honey never will become sugar. If it does crystallize, simply loosen the lid and let the honey jar sit in boiled water, as this will allow the honey to re-liquefy naturally. It is important to note that you do not put a honey jar in boiling water while still be heated or in a microwave as these will kill the enzymes in the honey. Obviously, you will never read about this in the mainstream media because they are hookers for BigPharma and could interfere with their drug pushing profits if too many people learned about the effectiveness of sulfur-based remedies. Today's science says that even though honey is sweet and when taken in the right dosage as a 'medicine', it will not and does not harm even diabetics. Ok, all that being said, let's get to healing qualities of the sulfur-based cinnamon/honey combination as researched by Western scientists, who by the way, are clueless about the sulfur effectiveness or the fact that cinnamon and honey are sulfur based: HEART DISEASE Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder and apply it on bread instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and could prevent a heart attack. If someone already had a heart attack and you take this combination, your next heart attack may never happen. The regular use of this combination relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as one ages, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; the cinnamon and honey combination revitalizes the arteries and veins. ARTHRITIS Arthritis patients should take, twice a day (morning and night), a cup of hot water with two tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. When taken regularly, even chronic arthritis can be cured. In a research project conducted at Copenhagen University, it was found that when doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon of honey and a half-teaspoon of cinnamon powder before breakfast, they found that within a week 73 out of the 200 tested were totally relieved of pain. Within a month, most all of the people who had trouble walking or moving around because of their arthritis could walk without pain. BLADDER INFECTIONS Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It will destroy the germs in the bladder. CHOLESTEROL Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of water were found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10 percent within two hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, when taken three times a day, chronic cholesterol is cured. The scientists also found that pure honey taken with food on a daily basis relieves complaints of cholesterol. COLDS Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon of lukewarm honey with one quarter of a spoonful for cinnamon powder daily for three days as this procedure will cure most chronic coughs, colds, and will clear the sinuses. UPSET STOMACH Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers for its roots. GAS According to the studies done in India and Japan, it is revealed that when honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. IMMUNE SYSTEM Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacterial and viral attacks. The scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in larger amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles, where the DNA is contained, to fight bacterial and viral diseases. INDIGESTION Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food is eaten relieves acidity and aids in the digestion of the heaviest of meals. INFLUENZA A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural 'ingredient', which kills the flu germs and will prevent the person from getting the flu. (I ain't no learned scientist but I do know that the natural 'ingredient' is sulfur and that those that take the organic sulfur crystals never get the flu). LONGEVITY Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. Use four teaspoons of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder, and three cups of boiling water to make the tea. Drink one quarter of a cup three to four times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and delays aging. Life spans increase and even those in their 90s plus, will have the energy of someone half their age. Allow me to inject some humor here: I play in two senior softball leagues. One of the guys, who is 87 asks me if the sulfur crystals are good for erectile dysfunction. I tell him that they are but they must be taken twice a day. About two weeks later I ask him if he is taking the crystals. He says he is. I then ask him if he is taking them twice a day. He says he is taking them once a day. I reminded him that their utmost effectiveness is by taking them twice a day. He says that he knows that but his wife can't handle it when he takes them twice a day. RASPY OR SORE THROAT When the throat has a tickle or is raspy, take one tablespoon of honey and sip it until it is finished. Repeat this every three hours until the throat is without symptoms. PIMPLES Three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon power paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it off the next morning with warm water. When done for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root (of course, eliminating sugar from the diet couldn't hurt). SKIN INFECTIONS Applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts to cure eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. WEIGHT LOSS In the morning and one half hour before breakfast and on an empty stomach, and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup of water. When taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. CANCER Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon power three times a day for one month. FATIGUE Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens who take honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts are more alert and flexible. A Dr. Milton, who apparently does not have a first name, has done research showing that a half tablespoon of honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, even when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, when taken daily after brushing and in the afternoon at about 3:00 P.M., the vitality of the body increases within a week. BAD BREATH Gargling with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water first thing in the morning will keep the breath fresh all day. HEARING LOSS Allegedly, daily morning and night honey and cinnamon powder, taken in equal parts restores hearing. TOOTHACHE Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply it to the aching tooth three times a day until the ache is gone. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure and its accompanying symptoms of chest pain and dizziness disappeared in many patients' just weeks after an Italian researcher gave them regular doses of honey and cinnamon. Blood pressure improved and all 137 subjects felt better after a few weeks. REGARDING CINNAMON The cinnamon powder that you get in the super markets could very well be sawdust that has been colored and artificially flavored. I think it is better to get the bark and powder it yourself or but it from a reputable natural food store. Most spices are irradiated. This is supposedly done to eradicate bacteria, but spices are generally excellent bactericides so the irradiation is merely a way of destroying the precious properties of spices. Non-irradiated spices are available from most high-end health foods stores. Cinnamon can be confused for cassia and in fact many powdered forms use cassia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassia ). It is also known as 'bastard cinnamon'. True cinnamon is also known as 'Ceylon' cinnamon. There are other variants such as Indonesian and Vietnamese so avoid anything that is from these countries. Specifically ask for Ceylon Cinnamon. Cinnamomum zeylanicum is the botanical name for the purest and most potent form of cinnamon. Not long ago I wrote an article for selfnews on the 21 Reasons To Try Organic Sulfur Crystals. See if you notice the similarities in benefits. 1. Organic sulfur is not a drug or prescription medicine, but rather a nutrient that the body is deprived of. 2. It increases enzyme production within the glands of the body, substantially increasing resistance to illness. 3. It increases flexibility in the tissues within the body and increases blood circulation. 4. It reduces muscle and joint inflammation, promotes healing in the muscles and joints and prevents them from becoming sore. To the degree there is soreness, recovery and return to normality is quickened. Athletes, in particular, benefit from this as the intake of OS dramatically increases their recovery time. 5. It eliminates 'free radicals' in the body. Allergies to pollens ad certain foods can be eliminated or reduced by its use. 6. It promotes healthy, increased growth of hair and fingernails. 7. Because of the oxygenation of the cells and tissues that the OS facilitates, the body is kept in a constant aerobic environment making it so that cancer cells cannot survive or exist. 8. Studies have shown it can help reverse symptoms of osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 9. It aids in healthy skin production and the reduction of 'wrinkles'. It is one of the main ingredients in moisturizing creams. 10. It helps the body properly regulate insulin production. Adequate OS in the diet may reduce the amount of insulin injections. 11. It helps alleviate chronic headaches and migraines. Increased circulation in the brain cells promotes proper blood circulation within the brain. Less pressure and pain result, reducing tendencies for headaches. 12. It helps alleviate emphysema by providing the body with material to manufacture new, healthy cells on lung walls. 13. Because of the ability to make cell walls more permeable. OS causes the body to rapidly release and reduce alcohol 'hangover' toxins, removing them as waste from the body. The process quickens recovery time from a 'hangover', often as quickly as 20 minutes. 14. It helps in reducing and often eliminating diverticulitis. Parasites living in the intestines are unable to remain attached to the walls due to the slippery coating that the OS produces. Because of this, hatching parasitic worms are flushed out as well because they cannot attach to the walls. 15. It reduces hypoglycemia in the body because it has made it easier for the body to introduce blood sugar through more permeable cell walls. Less insulin is demanded for the process, resulting in less overuse of the pancreas. Within several months of constant usage, OS can reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia entirely. 16. It helps alleviate PMS. Glandular production is enhanced by OS to have more 'normal' levels of production. Acid, enzyme, and hormonal levels are more evenly balanced facilitating reduction of cramps, headaches, and nausea associated with the monthly cycle. 17. It helps promote better kidney function more efficiently. Water retention problems associated with poor kidney function can be alleviated. 18. It can help alleviate eye problems. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of the sulfur crystals in 4 ounces of water and use as eye drops as frequently as you like. 19. OS delivers the essential omega-3 throughout the body and also allows the body to produce vitamin B-12. 20. It has amazingly reversed countless cases of asthma and 18 cases of autism that we know about so far. 21. Last and certainly not least, it eliminates the continued need for Viagra or Cialis by reversing erectile dysfunction. This is by far the ONLY substance that can remove the poisons from pesticides, heavy metals, radiation, and other toxins.

About the author: I have been doing a weekly radio show in Honolulu since 1981 called 'Health Talk'. In 2007 I was 'forced' to get a Masters degree in Nutrition because of all the doctors that would call in asking for my credentials. They do not call in anymore. Going to www.healthtalkhawaii.com enables you, among other things, to listen to the shows. I am an activist. In addition to espousing an organic vegan diet for optimum health, I am strongly opposed to GMOs, vaccines, processed foods, MSG, aspartame, fluoridation and everything else that the pimps (Big Pharma, Monsanto and the large food companies) and the hookers (the doctors, the government agencies, the public health officials, and the mainstream media) thrust upon us, the tricks. After being vaccinated with the DTP vaccine as a child I developed asthma. After taking the organic sulfur crystals (they are harvested from the pine trees in Louisiana) in November of 2008 for 10 days my asthma reversed and has not come back over 4 years later, 18 cases, so far, of autism have been reversed, as has cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis, joint pain, astigmatism, gum disease, increased sexual activity, heavy metal and radiation elimination, parasite elimination, free radicals elimination, faster athletic recovery time, increased blood circulation, reduced inflammation, resistance to getting the flu, reduction of wrinkles, allergy reduction, reduced PMS and monthly period pain, nausea, migraines and so much more. And it's only possible because of the oxygen it releases that floods the cells of the body. The sulfur, as proven by the University of Southampton in England, enables the body to produce vitamin B12 and the essential amino acids.

0," An elaborate, well-sourced blog posting alleges that Bush-era officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, may have used the 9/11 attacks as a false justification to strike the late Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The Washington's Blog entry begins by quoting Rumsfeld, who claimed just hours after the attacks that left nearly 3,000 Americans dead, the World Trade Center in ruins and the Pentagon smoldering, that his 'interest is to hit Saddam Hussein,' - a statement attributed to him by NBC 's chief Pentagon correspondent, Jim Miklaszewski, who said he got it from a source inside the White House Situation Room. 'Sweep it all up' Next, the blog cites a CBS News story, which reported that notes taken by aides who were with Rumsfeld said he was already telling them to come up with a plan to strike Iraq though there was no evidence linking Iraq to 9/11: With the intelligence all pointing toward bin Laden, Rumsfeld ordered the military to begin working on strike plans. And at 2:40 p.m., the notes quote Rumsfeld as saying he wanted 'best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit S.H.' - meaning Saddam Hussein - 'at same time. Not only UBL' - the initials used to identify Osama bin Laden. 'Go massive,' the notes quote him as saying. 'Sweep it all up. Things related and not.' In the days following the attacks, the blog notes, President George W. Bush was told during a highly classified meeting that the U.S. intelligence community had no good intel linking the 9/11 attacks to Saddam or Iraq , and that there was scant, little evidence linking his regime to al Qaeda in general. In fact, the Defense Department said Hussein's government did not cooperate with al Qaeda prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, CBS News reported in 2009, a claim refuted by Cheney. 'However,' CBS said, 'a declassified Pentagon report released Thursday said that interrogations of Saddam and two of his former aides as well as seized Iraqi documents confirmed that the terrorist organization and the Saddam government were not working together before the invasion.' In addition, the 9/11 Commission's report, issued in 2004, said there was no evidence linking Saddam to al Qaeda, the network reported. In 2005, The New York Times said the Bush administration pinned its Iraq-al Qaeda storyline on intelligence gleaned from an operative of the terrorist organization that intelligence officials later determined was providing false information: A top member of Al Qaeda in American custody was identified as a likely fabricator months before the Bush administration began to use his statements as the foundation for its claims that Iraq trained Al Qaeda members to use biological and chemical weapons, according to newly declassified portions of a Defense Intelligence Agency document. The intelligence document, dated February 2002, said the operative, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, 'was intentionally misleading debriefers' about claims that Iraq was assisting al Qaeda in the development of weapons of mass destruction. Thousands of troops died in Iraq Several Bush administration officials used the dubious connection as justification nonetheless, with Bush himself declaring during a speech in Cincinnati in October 2002 that 'we've learned that Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and gases.' Another operative, an Iraqi whose codename was Curveball , was also determined later to have provided false information about Iraq and mobile biological weapons labs. Before Bush issued the order to the Pentagon in March 2003 to invade Iraq, he made official the al Qaeda narrative in his letter to Congress authorizing the use of force: (2) acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. It wasn't until December 2005 that Bush finally admitted publicly that there had been no evidence directly linking Iraq to al Qaeda As of this writing, 4,488 American troops have been killed in Iraq.

0," If an American talks about using marijuana or other drugs in countries where such activity is perfectly legal, or even just discusses the hypothetical idea of such an activity with a friend or family member, he or she will be committing a felony crime under a heinous new bill recently passed by the US House Judiciary Committee. Sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor Elimination Act of 2011 essentially applies US policies in the 'War on Drugs' on the entire world, and makes it a crime for Americans to engage in, or even just talk about, activities that are legal abroad, but illegal back at home. 'Under this bill, if a young couple plans a wedding in Amsterdam, and as part of the wedding they plan to buy the bridal party some marijuana, they would be subject to prosecution,' said Bill Piper, director of the national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, a group advocating for reform of US drug laws. 'The strange thing is that the purchase of and smoking the marijuana while you're there wouldn't be illegal. But this law would make planning the wedding from the US a federal crime.' The wording of the bill is so broad and all-inclusive that it even includes US doctors that work internationally with therapies that may be illegal back in the States. In places like Portugal, for instance, where all drugs have been decriminalized, US doctors could face severe prosecution for contributing to, or being involved with, medical projects going on there. Non-Americans that conduct activities which are legal in their native countries, but illegal in the US, are also considered in violation of the law if they step foot on American soil, even during an airport layover. And Americans living overseas and producing natural medicine that is prohibited in the US, for instance, can also be targeted under the new law (this technically already happened to herbalist Greg Caton because of his anti-cancer salves: http://www.selfnews.com/033573_FDA_abduct... ) 'Just when you think you can't get any more cynical, a bill like this comes along,' attorney and author Harvey Silvergate is quoted as saying by Huffington Post . 'There's no intuitive reason for an American to think that planning an activity that's perfectly legal in another country would have any effect on America. This is just an act of shameless cultural and legal imperialism. It's just outrageous.' "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Since the 2003 H5N1 outbreaks, experts have been saying that if the disease becomes easily transmitted between humans, a devastating pandemic will kill millions, but Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said it is not a matter of if a flu pandemic is coming, but when. 'The worst thing we can do is not prepare and think it will not happen,' Osterholm said, but added, 'The truth of the matter is, there's a lot we can do about it.' Osterholm -- who is a consultant for the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Human Services and has been on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and CNN's 'Nightline' to talk about flu pandemics -- addressed an audience at a town hall meeting in Illinois and said that history shows that a new pandemic strikes the world at least every 50 years. The last such pandemic was the Hong Kong flu -- H3N2 -- which took approximately 700,000 lives worldwide, about 40,000 of which were in the United States alone. The H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has already killed 141 people worldwide without mutating to a human-to-human strain, is likely to be the next devastating pandemic to sweep the globe, experts say. When it does, Osterholm said it is likely to kill at least 2.7 million people -- maybe as many as 360 million -- and people will probably have to take care of themselves as the devastation completely overpowers state and federal emergency management plans. 'Nobody in Washington or even Springfield is going to be here to help you, so you need to start thinking about this now,' Osterholm said to the audience, adding that communities should preempt the problem by starting their own leadership networks and planning for relief efforts and health care. 'No investment you ever make in this is going to be wasted,' he said. Osterholm said that next to a lack of preparation and assuming the pandemic will never come, the worst thing people can do is give up hope. 'Every population that endured one of these has survived it,' he said. 'We just have to keep telling ourselves that.' ### "
0," Canines apparently possess a unique olfactory trait that allows them to sniff out the presence of cancer in the breath of people with the disease. And a new pilot study out of Austria suggests that dogs just might be the wave of the future as far as early detection is concerned, with recent trials showing an incredible sniffing success rate among patients with lung cancer. The results of the preliminary trial, which were published recently in a scientific journal, indicate a fascinating ability among dogs to literally sense the presence of cancer earlier and more successfully than many modern detection methods. Using 120 breath samples, the European researchers were able to determine that the dogs used for the trial were successful in detecting 70 percent of cancers, which clearly illustrates the animals' amazing ability. 'Dogs have no problem identifying tumor patients,' explained Peter Errhalt, head of the pulmonology department at Krems Hospital in Austria and author of the study, to AFP about the findings. The investigation was a follow-up to earlier hypotheses about dogs' apparent abilities to detect all sorts of diseases simply by being near people who had them. It also piggybacks earlier research from 2011 that identified a canine's ability to detect early-stage bowel cancer, a condition that is apparently very difficult to detect using even modern medical technologies. ( http://www.selfnews.com/031240_cancer_dogs.html ) 'The specific cancer scent indeed exists, but the chemical compounds are not clear,' explained Dr. Hideto Sonoda from Kyushu University in Japan to BBC News last year about this mysterious and unknown cancer scent that dogs are able to pick up. 'Only the dog knows the true answer.' And it is this answer that the researchers in Austria hope to discover through further research. By learning precisely what mechanism exists in dogs' noses that allows them to detect cancer , as well as the specific compound they are smelling, researchers could one day develop new, practical tools for cancer detection. And the Austrian team now hopes to put together a two-year study that will reportedly be 10 times larger than the trial in order to confirm the results. 'The ultimate aim is ... for scientists to identify what scents the dogs are detecting,' added Michael Mueller from Otto Wagner Hospital in Vienna to AFP . With this information, researchers can then develop some type of 'electronic nose' to detect cancer in a clinical setting, without the need for actual dogs being stationed at hospitals and clinics. "
0," The leading cause of skin-cancer death in the United States, melanoma, may be prevented by engaging in a habit that's familiar to millions of Americans. The act of drinking coffee might offer protection against the devastating illness, according to a study conducted by researchers from Yale University and the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). (1,2) To conduct the study, the experts reviewed data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which involved nearly 450,000 cancer-free patients. Over the course of more than 10 years, their food intake, which included coffee consumption, was reviewed. So too was their incidence of melanoma. Nearly 3,000 participants had developed melanoma during this time frame. However, it was discovered that, overall, those who drank more coffee daily were less likely to develop the condition during follow-up periods. A 20 percent lowered melanoma risk, for example, was linked to those who consumed four cups of coffee daily. (2) Coffee has 'bioactive compounds' that may reduce melanoma risk Considering that America loves its coffee, this is good news. A great deal of people enjoy their cup of joe; more than half of Americans are said to enjoy an average of over three cups per day. (2) However, this isn't to say that people should engage in unhealthy skin behaviors so long as they have their favorite coffee by their side. Erikka Loftfield, a graduate student at the Yale School of Public Health stressed this point, saying, 'The most important thing a person can do to reduce risk is to reduce sun and ultraviolet light exposure.' (3) The study, titled 'Coffee Drinking and Cutaneous Melanoma Risk in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study,' was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . It states: Cutaneous melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. Modifiable risk factors, with the exception of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), are poorly understood. Coffee contains numerous bioactive compounds and may be associated inversely with melanoma . (4) The study concludes: Higher coffee intake was associated with a modest decrease in risk of melanoma in this large US cohort study. Additional investigations of coffee intake and its constituents, particularly caffeine, with melanoma are warranted . (4) Other findings show health benefits of drinking coffee While it suggests that other studies are needed in this particular instance, several other findings outside of this study support coffee's health benefits. For example, consumption of it has been linked to lessening the risk of a kind of primary liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. In some cases, it was found to decrease that particular risk by up to 50 percent in those who drank three cups daily. Drinking the beverage has also been associated with achieving other positive health benefits, including reduced risk of oral cancer, endometrial cancer and prostate cancer. (5) According to the Mayo Clinic, melanoma is the 'most serious' form of skin cancer and is showing a trend toward increased incidences mainly in women under the age of 40. As with most conditions, they explain that early detection is the best prevention, so be sure to engage in routine self-checks on your skin and speak to a medical professional about any concerning changes in the skin's appearance. A weak immune system, fair skin, past sunburns and a family history of melanoma are some risk factors that can contribute to its development. (6,7) Don't care for coffee? Enjoy these skin-saving foods In addition to a few cups of coffee, one might also consider eating skin-saving health foods. Healthy fats such as those found in walnuts, salmon and olive oil are thought to extend skin's health. Other foods that help reduce the risk or recurrence of skin cancer include peaches, avocado, red bell peppers, winter squash and berries. They all contain cancer-preventing antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.

0," Prior to the current budgetary sequestration, President Barack Obama went on the record publicly warning Americans of dire consequences should the planned cuts that he himself helped devise - and eventually signed into law - be allowed to go into effect. 'This work, along with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are currently in jeopardy because of politics in Washington. In a few days, Congress might allow a series of immediate, painful, arbitrary budget cuts to take place, known in Washington as the sequester,' he said Feb. 19 at a shipyard in Newport News, Va. 'These cuts are wrong. They're not smart, they're not fair.' Continuing, Obama predicted more dire consequences: If the sequester goes into effect, more than 2,000 college students would lose their financial aid. Across the country these cuts will force federal prosecutors to close cases and potentially let criminals go. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks and that could cause delays at airports across the country. The president also warned that the cuts would lead to furloughs of 800,000 federal defense workers , as well as layoffs of local first responders, police and firefighters (all of whom, by the way, are paid with local funds , but I digress). Self-fulfilling prophecy? After the March 1 deadline passed and the sequestered cuts became mandatory, Obama eased off his dire warnings, though with far less fanfare, admitting that the cuts would not be as devastating as he claimed they would be. 'We will get through this. This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think as some people have said,' he said, following a nearly hour-long meeting with lawmakers March 1. As you have read, 'some people' who have said the sequester was going to be apocalyptic includes, of course, the president . Apparently, however, Obama is set to make his initial claims that the sequester would be painful on Americans a self-fulfilling prophesy, according to government emails that have been publicized by the Washington Times : The Obama administration denied an appeal for flexibility in lessening the sequester's effects, with an email this week appearing to show officials in Washington that because they already had promised the cuts would be devastating, they now have to follow through on that. In the email sent Monday by Charles Brown, an official with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service office in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Brown asked 'if there was any latitude' in how to spread the sequester cuts across the region to lessen the impacts on fish inspections. The answer from the White House, quite simply, was... no . 'The Obama administration is doing everything it can...' 'We have gone on record with a notification to Congress and whoever else that 'APHIS would eliminate assistance to producers in 24 states in managing wildlife damage to the aquaculture industry, unless they provide funding to cover the costs.' So it is our opinion that however you manage that reduction, you need to make sure you are not contradicting what we said the impact would be.' In other words, agency officials are being told by the president - who is head of the Executive Branch and directly oversees the vast array of government agencies - to make pain so he can blame it on the sequester and, by default, the opposition party. 'This email confirms what many Americans have suspected: The Obama administration is doing everything they can to make sure their worst predictions come true and to maximize the pain of the Sequester cuts for political gain,' said Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican lawmaker from Arkansas. APHIS is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and on March 5, during a congressional hearing, agency head Tom Vilsack said he hadn't seen the email Brown referenced. 'If we have flexibility, we're going to try to use it to make sure we use sequester in the most equitable and least disruptive way,' Vilsack said in response to a question from Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D. 'There are some circumstances, and we've talked a lot about the meat inspection, where we do not have that flexibility because there are so few accounts.' Noem said the email made it sound as if the administration was attempting to use the sequester for political gain. 'I'm hopeful that isn't an agenda that's been put forward,' she said.

0," Yesterday, I covered the mystery of the pressure-cooker bomb. Where are all the holes in the remains of the cooker that should be there, owing to the fact that ball bearings and nails were packed around the explosive material, and all this shrapnel would have been driven through the cooker out into the air? There are no holes. At least we should see obvious evidence that shrapnel adhered to the walls of the cooker and pitted it considerably. We don't see any of that. Now, we are told, the lid of one of the cookers was found on a rooftop, blown there by the bomb. Yet, again, photos show there are no holes in the lid. No shrapnel adhering to it. What were the actual bombs at the Marathon? The whole government scenario in the Marathon murders is collapsing. Mike Adams, writing at selfnews, is exploring the members of the Craft private security team who were present at the Marathon finish line. At least one member of the team was carrying a radiation detector. What for? As Mike states, these pros don't work for free. Who hired them? Why were they there? Major media aren't discussing the subject. A college track coach. Alastair Stevenson, present at the Marathon, heard police announcements that a drill was taking place. Boston police are stonewalling that report. Why? The Boston Globe tweeted that the bomb squad was about to detonate a device, in a controlled explosion, across the street from the JFK Library, a mile away from the Marathon. Then, no followup. Nothing. Suddenly, there was no bomb at the Library. It was just a small fire. A Saudi national, Abdul Rhaman Ali Alharbi, was declared a suspect in the bombing. He was downgraded to a 'person of interest.' Then he was innocent, but severely burned. Now he's not severely burned. His travel visa has been revoked. He's being sent home, deported, to Saudi Arabia. A free pass out of the country, on the heels of what Reuters is calling an unscheduled meeting between Obama and the Saudi foreign minister at the White House. This all gives rise to a conclusion. To be a government official, it's essential to be able to lie. Chronically. I was recently a guest on Mike Bundrant's radio show, 'Mental Health Exposed.' We discussed cult mentality and how far-reaching it actually is. You can listen to the show here. http://radio.selfnews.com/Archive-MentalHealthExposed.asp You can also visit Robert Scott Bell's radio archives at www.RobertScottBell.com and find many shows in which Robert and I discuss cult mentality in science, and what I call the Church of Biological Mysticism. This mentality applies to government and follows the three stages of cult development. By development, I mean deterioration. Take a federal agency---FBI, ATF, FDA, CIA, NIH, CDC. Each organization starts out with great enthusiasm, upon its creation. It announces big goals and makes an important mission statement. The ideals are high-flying. The personnel are filled with hope and energy. Stage one. In remarkably short order, something takes shape out of the fog: the leader is far more important than anyone realized. He not only sets the tone. He sits at the apex of a structure. At first, the structure was merely assumed to be whatever was necessary to forward the objectives. But now, in stage two, it assumes primacy. The leader informs the members (personnel) that the structure must survive. In order to do that, it will have to grow. There is no going back to the beginning. Widening the organization is a mandate of great priority. And for growth to happen, the members must assert extreme loyalty to the overarching goals, yes, but actually to the organization and the leader. The leader personifies the structure. He is the monarch. He issues the marching orders to his major minions, and they pass these orders, through the command-and-control apparatus, down to each member. Through repetitive brainwashing, realities are impressed upon the minds of the adherents (members, personnel). No one can wander off the reservation. Initiative and independent action, while seeming to be useful, are actually counter-productive and even dangerous. This the party line---exactly what would, for instance, keep a police officer from following his nose and his innate curiosity in politically charged investigation like the Marathon bombings. There are rules, and the burgeoning number of them are there to ensure the survival of the group. The rules have been carefully crafted. They are 'for the greater good.' 'We're all in this together.' 'What one person does affects everyone.' 'Don't go rogue.' In this stage two, a transformation is taking place. The idealism of the early days is being squashed, in favor of the collective. The survival of the collective is hammered, again and again. at the members. Without extreme obedience, the whole structure would fall apart and wash away. And who wants that kind of death? Stage three makes it appearance with pronouncements about external enemies. The leader carries that essential freight; convincing the members they are under threat is the mind-control glue that holds everybody together. These enemies want to destroy (or de-fund) the organization. They want to denigrate the group's objectives. They want to defame the leader. The enemies, real and imagined, are named. It only matters that they seem to proliferate. Their threatening presence further tunes up the members. 'We're under attack. Don't waver now. Only the strong survive. Take heart. We will win this war. Obedience is more important than ever.' It's an easy step from external to internal enemies. That is the cherry on the cake. 'We have a mole. There are traitors among us. Someone has leaked proprietary information. We've been infiltrated.' Now, an atmosphere of secrecy, suspicion, and paranoia spreads like poison among the members. The leader orders internal investigations, to root out the turncoats. At the same time, the organization is committing crimes. They are lying, they are stealing, they are making alliances with 'influential people from the outside.' This is happening at the highest levels of the structure. Gone are the high-flying emotions of the early days. Life in the organization is grim. The structure has become large enough and criminal enough that some members are secretly looking for ways to game their own system. Others have gone passive and simply do what they're told. The leader is pictured as a heroic embattled figure, standing on the parapet, directing his troops against invaders. Defectors from within the ranks are multiplying. But to a degree, the brainwashing holds. 'In these dangerous times, your work is more important than ever. Deserting your post could defeat our objectives. We're the good guys. Only we know how vital our goals are. We hold the key to survival. Your leader needs you. We all need you. Don't back out now.' In the cult of government, there are exceptions. It's understood that some talented and facile members will leave, only to join the outside criminal allies of the group. Otherwise known as 'the revolving door' of government and industry. There is another level of brainwashing inside big government cults (departments, agencies). 'Government is good. Without it, society would collapse. The larger government is, the better it is. The purpose of government is to serve. We need more government, not less. Never do we need less.' Members are now told, are made to understand, that lying and cheating are absolutely necessary. 'For the greater good.' 'Ends justify means.' This becomes the cultural imperative. Therefore, in a situation like the Boston Marathon murders , the discovery of a perpetrator is a must. The case cannot go unsolved. It is far better to arrest and prosecute, or kill, an innocent person than to wind up with nothing. Winding up with nothing would demean and cast an ill glow on the investigating agencies and even the president of the United States. And on top of that, the right type of person must be selected as the scapegoat. He must painted with a particular political persuasion. As time passes, and these government cults continue to expand, the language of criminality filters down from the high echelons, where it has been 'the royal speech' for a very long time, to the lower levels. The pretense is stripped away. 'Do what you need to.' 'We're making deals.' 'Line up the Senator. He knows which side his bread is buttered on.' 'Don't tell (another agency) what we're doing. They'd use it against us.' 'Invoke national security and tell them to go screw themselves.' 'Get me the file. We've got the goods on that bastard. He's not going to mess with us.' 'All hands on deck. I want a complete report on our accomplishments over the past year for the budget hearings in six months. Pad it. This has to look brilliant.' 'Hey, that's our lobbyist, not your lobbyist.' 'We're cooking the intelligence. What the hell else would you expect us to do.' In retrospect, a true investigation would show that any one of these big government cults has been colluding with outside criminal forces for a very long time, even perhaps from its beginnings. Over decades, cult leaders come and go. They assume new qualities. They are now the faceless soulless ones. They run their machine organizations according to the principle of caution and plausible deniability. Each one of the cults employs a balance of androids, game players, and true believers. They are all finally ground down to a fine mixture of particles. It no longer matters what the members believe or feel. They fill posts and positions and they do their jobs. Lying, cheating, stealing, and even killing are ordinary aspects of the jobs. That is how a cult endures. This is what author Hannah Arendt was talking about when she coined the phrase, 'the banality of evil.' The hive, the nest, the group, the cult, the collective weaves a fairy tale about its vital contributions, but underneath it all, it assumes all the features of a mafia. Within the cult, an air of unreality pervades. The astonishingly sharp division between its announced aims and its real practices produces an acrid stench which, through its public relations people, is blown across a sanitized air conditioning system, in hopes of achieving a neutrality that will escape attention. The cult is a double-decker psyop aimed at the outside world and its own members. In typical bland fashion, government cults present a determined face to the public. 'We do our jobs in a systematic way. We know the best methods and we employ them. We get results.' Therefore, when independent researchers and investigators discover gaping holes in the way these cults go about their business (Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston ), the official response is: conspiracy theorists; nuts; crazies; obstructionists. You could call this the fourth stage of the cult. It no longer looks like a devoted band of followers with a leader. It no longer looks like an organization composed of individual humans. It looks like an army of units. It looks like an apparatus. It looks like a computerized set of functions. On closer inspection, it resembles a fungus. Individual cells reproduce, and their offspring in turn reproduce. The overall organism moves out in every direction, developing strategies to attach itself to organic and inorganic matter. Any Something can be a host. Watching this process, outsiders who have surrendered their own souls as independent individuals begin to realize this is the apotheosis of their dream. To promote and somehow belong to the advancing mold, the spreading decay. This, they believe, is power. The only power. Perversely, the original stated goals of the cult, the high-flying ideals, are reintroduced. Now, in their new incarnation, they are grotesque cartoons. But as Nazi propagandists knew, the bigger the lie, the greater the likelihood of it being believed. Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays, the father of modern public relations, and the cadres of psychological warfare specialists who followed in his wake, understood that, by speaking to the masses over and over, by addressing the collective, by building up stereotypes of human beings, they could wipe out and reprogram a significant number of individual minds on the planet. In doing so, they vastly multiplied the supply of potential cult members. Walk into the headquarters of any government agency or large corporation and you will see the result. They are inside the hive dream. We are outside. Believe it or not: our platform is stronger. Coming to understand that fact in your blood, muscles, brain, mind, and imagination is the key to the door that opens into the river, the river of unbounded energy, where freedom is the future.

0," A quarter of British young adults walk 'only when necessary,' resulting in less than 5 minutes of activity per day, according to a new study by health insurance company Bupa. The survey, conducted on 2,000 British adults, focused on young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. The researchers found that, although the British Heart Foundation recommends a minimum of 30 minutes per day spent walking, the average woman walked only 12 minutes per day, and the average man walked only 8 minutes. 15 percent of adults decided to walk somewhere but gave up partway through (switching to public transportation) at least once a week. Parents aged 42 to 54 largely attributed their children's sedentism to new technology, such as smart phones and social media, and said that they had walked more at the same age. The young adults themselves, however, had different explanations. The most common excuse given for not walking was 'I don't have anyone to walk with.' Women typically cited poor weather or fatigue, while men typically blamed lack of time or a busy schedule. Among adults in general, the most common excuses were weather (31 percent), lack of time (26 percent), lack of fitness (12 percent), not feeling safe (11 percent) and feeling too tired (11 percent). 'It's so easy to make numerous excuses but there are many health benefits to walking,' said Bupa's UK Medical Director, Paula Franklin. 'For most people it is the most accessible form of physical activity, which is also free and can be great fun. Serious health risks The findings are of particular concern given the risks of sedentism on the one hand and the fact that people are neglecting such an easy form of exercise on the other. 'Walking can usually fit easily into your daily routine and something as simple as choosing to walk even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus can have a huge impact on your health,' Franklin said. 'For example, adding just 20 minutes walking to your day can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and strokes.' In addition to obesity and heart disease, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes and spinal problems. As people become less active, doctors are increasingly seeing these diseases in a younger demographic. Stating that the most common type of diabetes - type 2 diabetes - is primarily caused by obesity, he said, 'We are finding more young people aged between 25-30 years getting diabetes as compared to the earlier trend of adults aged between 45-50 developing the illness,' said physician Rejesh Naik, a member of the Indian Medical Association. Another Indian doctor, Preeti Doshi, who runs the pain clinic at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, also blamed sedentism for health problems striking earlier in life. 'Sedentary lifestyle , desk jobs, no exercise and poor posture attribute to spinal problem[s] which [are] affecting the age group of 35-55 the most,' he said. A childhood problem? Although the Bupa study focused on young adults, a recent study of Scottish children found that children are now becoming sedentary even as toddlers, debunking the idea that children are 'naturally' or spontaneously more active than adults. Indeed, the researchers found that the total energy expenditure, physical activity and sedentary behaviors of 78 three-year-olds were equivalent to those of sedentary or only lightly active adults. The children were still largely sedentary two years later. On average, they were expending 200 fewer calories than recommended each day, thereby starting on the path to obesity.

0," The people in the towns and farmland of Sonoma County are facing a battle over fluoridating the currently un-fluoridated public water supply. Petitions are circulating to keep Sonoma County's public water supply un-fluoridated, but the pro-fluoridation wing within the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) is advancing in the battle, using selective figures and sparse cases in attempting to prove that adding artificial fluoride to the water would actually be 'forward progress' for the area's dental hygiene. Why fight to keep Sonoma County water pure? Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the sole reason of being a 'treatment' of the people, according to Dr. Paul Connett, director of the Fluoride Alert Network. 'Japan and 97 percent of the western European population do not consume fluoridated water, while in the U.S., about 70 percent of public water supplies are fluoridated.' However, the World Health Organization's data show that tooth decay rates have 'precipitously declined' in all western countries, irrespective of whether the country ever fluoridated its water. Indeed, most western countries do not fluoridate their water and yet their tooth decay rates have declined at the same rate as the U.S. and other fluoridated countries. Sonoma, CA must be the next Wichita, KS Wichita, KS, recently rejected adding fluoride to its water supply last November. Likewise, Sonoma County, which has a population of about 484,000 people, has many people who oppose adding fluoride to their water . But protecting their natural rights, by educating the public and stopping those with influence over SCWA, will require a substantial effort. Some of the five members of the Board of Directors of SCWA already seem ready to be convinced to go ahead with the proposal. Emotional tearjerkers and crimes against wisdom The main tactic of those who want to begin fluoridating the water supply of Sonoma County is being made through a 'life is better with teeth' PR campaign, saying some children are getting cavities that cost the county a lot of money to treat. In other words, treat the problem of artificially sweetened foods with artificially fluoridated water. This merely expresses the absurdity that one crime against wisdom could be 'redeemed' by continuing to commit more crimes against wisdom. Although solving dental hygiene issues through fluoridation is scientifically unsupportable, the voices of those who understand nature, health, and sanity need more support. Action call to keep water healthy and pure Sonoma County has been a flourishing place to live without fluoride for over 163 years. Nevertheless, the SCWA would begin fluoridating the water supply of Sonoma County for the first time, within 12 months from now, if that proposal isn't stopped. The amount of a toxic substance to take into the body is an individual's choice. Defeating the proposal to fluoridate the public water of 350,000 Sonoma County residents , as well as the 50,000 Marin County residents who are also supplied by SCWA, is an important battle for health freedom in America today. You can sign the petition to not begin fluoridating the Sonoma County water at: http://www.change.org You can also address comments to the members of SCWA directly: Susan Gorin, David Rabbitt, Shirlee Zane, Mike McGuire, and Efren Carrillo, and its General Manager, Grant Davis, through: http://scwa.ca.gov "
0," Tweet The American Heart Association, which has for decades fought against vitamins and nutritional supplements, has now found a new reason to recommend that people stop taking vitamins -- and instead start taking cholesterol-lowering prescription drugs like statins. The new evidence? A review of older studies, using synthetic forms of vitamin E, have concluded that the synthetic vitamin E supplements and other anti-oxidants don't offer much protection against heart disease. As a result, the AHA has taken this as an opportunity to discredit all vitamins, and many of the headlines you see in the news these days say vitamins are worthless, or, 'Vitamins are no good for your heart.' It's all hogwash, of course, and it's yet more anti-vitamin propaganda from the AHA, designed to do nothing more than support the sales of prescription drugs. But before believing that conclusion yourself, allow me to explain what's really behind these studies, and what is motivating the AHA to issue this sort of damaging advice. The first thing to note is that in nearly all of these studies, the form of vitamin E that was used was a synthetic form of vitamin E. In other words, they used a chemical that never appears in nature. By using this chemical and claiming it's vitamin E, they can discredit all vitamin E by suggesting that the chemicals they use are in fact the same as natural vitamin E. But they are not the same at all -- from a molecular point of view, they are opposites. Had they used natural vitamin E, there's little doubt that the results would have been far more positive. In fact, I believe that many of these vitamin studies are constructed in an effort to discredit vitamins and accordingly, they purposely choose artificial, synthetic vitamin E instead of natural vitamin E. The next thing that's wrong with this study is that it looked at only isolated antioxidants. As we know, antioxidants work in concert. When you eat whole foods or take organic vitamins made from whole foods, you are ingesting a vast array of antioxidants and phytonutrients that support human health and fight heart disease. A person who wants to have a healthy cardiovascular system will of course get their nutrition from whole foods and superfoods, such as chlorella and broccoli sprouts, sea vegetables, healthy oils, and so on. But in these studies, they didn't use full spectrum superfoods or whole foods. Instead, they used isolated chemical compounds, and the more isolated any compound is, the less effective it will be in supporting human health. These researchers must be aware of that fact, and once again, that is probably why they always choose isolated compounds for studying the effect of nutritional supplements. You see this a lot in western medicine, and it's a paradigm that permeates the belief systems of western medical researchers and doctors. They believe that the health benefits of any food, if there is such a benefit, can typically be attributed to one or two so-called 'active ingredients.' They believe that a food can be understood by breaking it down into its parts -- a sort of Descartes reductionism in terms of nutrition. And when they seek to study the potential health effects of foods, they extract certain isolated ingredients and merely test those. Then they assume that whatever results were achieved from that test are equivalent to the health effects of eating the whole food. We've seen this in the past with tomatoes and lycopene. Many studies have used lycopene extracts and then concluded that tomatoes don't offer you much of a health benefit because isolated lycopene didn't show such a strong benefit. The next bit of advice from the American Heart Association is that people should not only stop taking vitamins and antioxidants, but that they rely entirely on foods for their nutrition. They say eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and poultry, and avoid taking vitamins and nutritional supplements. Well, once again, this is terrible nutritional advice that will no doubt ensure that millions of Americans remain diseased with heart disease, and thus will further ensure the survival and the importance of the American Heart Association. This advice assumes that the national food supply is a good source of nutrition, and that assumption dangerously incorrect. Not only are our foods depleted of minerals in terms of the soils in which they're grown, but such foods also lose additional nutrients when they are cooked and prepared for meals by consumers. By my calculations, you have to eat 10,000 calories a day of readily available grocery store food just to meet the minimum USRDA numbers for the primary vitamins and minerals. That's 10,000 calories a day, or approximately 500% more food than the average American adult really needs. Even a guy like Lance Armstrong doesn't even burn 10,000 calories a day, meaning you would have to eat yourself into a massive state of obesity in order to prevent nutritional deficiencies as described by the USRDA numbers. Yet, the AHA recommends that this is precisely the way you should get your nutrition: by relying on nothing but everyday foods. They're recommending that you should eat approximately 2,000 calories per day, meaning you should only get 1/5 of the nutrition required to actually prevent disease, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental depression and other such diseases. This is one of the many ways in which the AHA provides advice that actually promotes disease. Remember, for decades, the AHA recommended that heart patients avoid all dietary fats -- another bit of advice that also promoted cardiovascular disease due to the important role of healthy fats in preventing heart attacks. As it turns out, the only way to actually get the nutrition you need to not only meet the USRDA numbers but exceed those numbers in an effort to prevent or even reverse chronic disease is to supplement your diet with high-density nutritional supplements such as superfoods, herbs, organic vitamins, trace minerals, powdered whole foods, and other sources that provide high-density nutrition without the calories associated with normal food. All of this is a rather obvious conclusion once a person understands nutrition and looks at the nutritional quality of the American food supply, but for some reason these obvious facts seem out of reach for our nation's top so-called experts on heart health, and the AHA remains dedicated to promoting statin drugs and other pharmaceuticals without speaking the truth about methods for preventing heart disease through nutrition. The bottom line to all this is that the AHA's advice is the advice of disease: they are saying don't take any vitamins, avoid nutritional supplements, and get your only nutrition from the nutritionally depleted food supply available in this country. That's terrible advice. That's the kind of advice that will undoubtedly land you in a hospital, dependent on prescription drugs, and possibly even with heart disease. Hearing all this typically drives cardiologists crazy because they believe everything the American Heart Association says. If the AHA says don't take vitamins, they will turn around and repeat that to their patients, regardless of how much nonsense the position entails. If the AHA says people can get all the nutrition they need from 3 meals a day, then that's the advice most cardiologists will pass on to their patients. It's as if many of these doctors simply don't think for themselves. Somehow, in medical school, too many people seem to lose the ability to engage in independent thought. They become propaganda machines for the AHA, the pharmaceutical industry, and the FDA, and they parrot whatever official statement comes down the line without giving it a second thought. If you want to know who's right about all this information, by the way -- myself or mainstream cardiologists -- just look at the health statistics of the people talking about this. My own cardiovascular health is ideal, even by western standards. I doubt there is any western-medicine-thinking, practicing cardiologist in this country who can demonstrate a higher degree of cardiovascular health than my own, and while most cardiologists aren't willing to talk about their own health records, I've posted mine publicly on the website for everyone to see. My LDL cholesterol is 67, my HDL cholesterol is 62, I have a resting heart rate of 48, and my blood pressure is 105/60. I would put this up against any cardiologist in the country if they want to talk about how to achieve a healthy cardiovascular system, and I can tell you this: I didn't get healthy by following the advice from the AHA. I got healthy by taking massive quantities of superfoods supplements, by eating all sorts of healthy oils and fats, including cashews, macadamia nuts, peanut oil, coconut oil, and flax oil, and by engaging in regular physical exercise. And out of those three basic things, the AHA has stood firmly against two out of the three for decades. For many years they've insisted that vitamins are no good for you, and that all diets should be low-fat diets. In fact, it was the AHA that was primarily responsible for the low-fat or no-fat dietary craze of the 1980's and '90's that caused so much obesity and diabetes in this country. So the AHA has a very poor history of being correct when it comes to health, which is one reason why I would not listen to this organization if you want to be a healthy individual. However, if you enjoy spending time with cardiologists, if you enjoy taking prescription drugs and watching television in hospital rooms, the AHA is a perfectly acceptable place to get your health information.

0," Tweet Obesity in a patient is an independent predictor of whether localized prostate cancer will progress following radiotherapy treatment, say researchers at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In a study reported in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Cancer, researchers found that moderately and severely obese patients had a 99 percent greater risk of developing biochemical failure (an early marker of cancer progression) than other patients. The study also reports that obese patients had a 66 percent increased risk of having a tumor that recurs or becomes metastatic than did non-obese patients. This finding mirrors results from a parallel study by M. D. Anderson researchers, reported last year in Clinical Cancer Research, that found that a history of weight gain or obesity at the time of diagnosis also played a role in how aggressive prostate cancer may become after surgery. 'Together, these studies confirm that a man's body mass index (BMI = weight/height2) can be a significant factor in how well he fares after standard treatments for prostate cancer,' says the lead researcher of both studies, Sara Strom, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology. 'The fact that the same association was found among patients with different risk profiles, and who were treated with different therapies, would suggest that poorer outcomes in obese men are not related to differences in treatment as much as to differences in tumor behavior between obese and non-obese men,' she says. Strom adds that these findings suggest that obese prostate cancer patients should be followed more closely after treatment. 'When patients and their physicians are uncertain about the need for further therapy, our research indicates that a man's weight should be factored into that decision,' she says. According to Strom, the study is the first to examine the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer progression after primary therapy with external beam radiotherapy, a common treatment option. The researchers sought to determine whether obesity is an independent predictor of biochemical failure - a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level that can indicate advancing cancer - and they also wanted to know if the cancer actually progressed among those patients. To conduct the study, the scientists examined the records of 873 patients whose prostate cancer was locally confined, and who were treated with radiotherapy at M. D. Anderson between 1988 and 2001. Of these patients, 18 percent were mildly obese and 5 percent were moderately to severely obese. They found that patients who were obese tended to be diagnosed with prostate cancer at an earlier age than patients who were not obese, and also that African-American men had the highest obesity rates. After an average follow-up period of 96 months, 295 patients experienced biochemical failure, and cancer recurred in 127 of these patients. After adjusting for clinical and treatment variables among patients, the researchers found that BMI significantly predicted whether a patient would experience both rising PSA and a return of prostate cancer. For example, biochemical failure occured more quickly with increased BMI: an average of 30 months for patients with normal weight, and 26 months for patients deemed moderately to severely obese. Researchers also found that when comparing obese patients with non-obese patients, obese men had a significantly higher rate of cancer recurrence. Strom and her colleagues cannot yet say why excess BMI contributed to cancer progression, or whether losing weight after a prostate cancer diagnosis will make any difference in outcome. 'But by knowing this association, we may be able to design rational preventive strategies,' she says. "
0," The modern-day consumer is inundated and assaulted by various endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Very little awareness exists. What are these chemicals doing to the human race as a whole? Expert health officials from the French government are pressuring the European Union to define these endocrine-disrupting chemicals and help raise awareness of the havoc they cause in destroying the human body's homeostasis. Endocrine disrupters pose several silent risks to the human body These endocrine-disrupting chemicals are basically limiting the human potential, to think, to reproduce and to ward off illness. These chemicals throw the endocrine system off balance, disrupting important glandular functions. Medical doctors only know how to send confused patients through various tests, diagnose their problems and prescribe them drugs that rarely get to the root cause. One of the root causes of health problems people face today is the invisible war going on in the endocrine system -- the war on the hormone glands. This silent hormone war originates on many fronts; the pesticide industry, the plastic industry and the mainstream perfume and body care industries all unleash endocrine-disrupting chemicals into people and the environment. Consumers rarely understand how these chemicals disrupt their body's homeostasis. It's a tough problem to fix, since many people use these endocrine-disrupting products on a daily basis; consumers are just unaware about the invisible dangers of how these chemicals accumulate in the body and restrict certain hormones from being produced. One of the clearest examples of endocrine disruption is evidenced by hysterectomies. Many times, hysterectomies are the medical system's response for women whose ovary glands struggle to keep producing a balanced amount of progesterone and estrogen. Other common hormone imbalances are seen in men whose muscle and male body characteristics fail to form after the onset of puberty. The unbalanced androgen and testosterone hormone levels can completely stunt one's own gender development. European Union under pressure to act on endocrine-disrupting chemicals The European Union is under pressure right now from the French government. Calling on the EU to react urgently, French health officials report that public health is being challenged by the damaging effects posed by endocrine disruptors. They have cited higher financial costs that continue to plague the healthcare sector, because no action is being taken to limit or stop these chemicals from existing. The committee has committed to new action as described in a December 2013 statement. The commission hopes to publish a new, comprehensive strategy to deal with endocrine disrupters, which includes public awareness and action. The committee said there is a need to publish a definition for endocrine disrupters based on the known hazards of these chemicals and not only 'on the notion of potency as has been put forward by industry.' The committee aims to alert the public about metals like lead and mercury, which both disrupt the endocrine system. These metals are being called out right now in products tested at the selfnews Forensic Food Lab. Endocrine disrupters on high alert are phthalates, which are plastic softeners found in most plastic water bottles. The chemicals used in household furniture and upholstery -- brominated flame retardants -- are also a hot topic of discussion for the committee. Furthermore, chemicals in perfumes, hair dyes, shampoos and other body care products are to be pinpointed for their endocrine-disrupting action. Also up for debate will be specific pesticides , which pervade agriculture, contaminating groundwater. Genon Jensen, executive director at the nongovernmental organization Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL), is also calling on the Commission to deliver and publish a strategy to eliminate endocrine disruptors from products as soon as possible. The situation is so critical that Swedish environment minister Lena Ek told the commission that she will sue if they breach their promise to prioritize and classify these endocrine-disrupting chemicals for public awareness. 'To reduce unnecessary health problems and healthcare costs, we need swift progress on endocrine-disrupting chemicals policy so as to start reducing people's daily exposures to chemicals linked to chronic disease,' she added.

0," Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's health was questioned after a lengthy coughing fit that abruptly interrupted her speech in Iowa recently. An audience of about 150 people had gathered at the Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines to hear the former secretary of state's views on Israel. As she was talking about the Iran nuclear deal, the 68-year-old Clinton had to stop her speech to pop a lozenge cough drop. The Jewish Federation president David Adelman had to take over the stage while she continued to cough and reached for a glass of water to get the coughing under control and find her voice once more. In between coughs she then quickly blamed the more than a minute long coughing fit on her busy campaign schedule. 'You do talk a lot in this campaign,' Clinton then told the crowd, her voice still hoarse and raspy. This was the first of four public events in the race against Sen. Bernie Sanders to win the support of Iowa's voters. Watch the video here: It's not the first time Clinton has had one of these coughing spells. Ever since her first public coughing fit, before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015, Clinton's health has been a topic of speculation. The fact that she has lozenge cough drops readily available in her pockets may be a sign that these coughing fits aren't just a one-time event. Hillary Clinton's healthcare statement In 2015, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign released a health statement confirming hypothyroidism as well as allergies. Dr. Lisa Bardack, her physician, said she regularly takes the thyroid hormone Armour Thyroid and the anticoagulant drug Coumadin to prevent blood clots, as well as an antihistamine for seasonal pollen allergies and vitamin B12, and that she doesn't smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. Armor Thyroid is often given to patients with an underactive thyroid, thyroid enlargement, or to manage thyroid cancer. After taking a fall in her home in December 2012, she was given blood thinners for a blood clot in her head, and is still taking them as a precautionary measure. While her doctor says she's in excellent health and fit to serve as president, her health constantly comes under question as the coughing worsens. Woman confronts Hillary Clinton about her health During a campaign event in Burlington, Iowa, a woman asked a question regarding Clinton's health. She referred to the FOX news statement that the democratic presidential candidate 'was really not equipped to be in the White House,' because she was ill. After rolling her eyes, this is what Clinton replied: 'Oh my. Well, you know, they say nearly anything about me. I've got to tell you,' Clinton, replied with a smile, referring to FOX News. 'There are several themes they keep beating the drums on. I'll match my endurance against anybody,' she said to loud applause. 'And last spring, my doctor put out a letter and you know, said what great health.' But is she as fit as she claims, or are these coughing fits a sign of a massive hidden health problem? "
0," The mainstream media is focused this week on trying to convince you that 'medical conspiracy theories' are whacky and untrue. Published by Reuters, USA Today and other mainstream media outlets, a false story based on distorted research is now trying to convince you that there is no such thing as a 'medical conspiracy.' No, drug companies never conducted experiments on children, killing many in the process. No, the NIH never took part in criminal medical experiments on prisoners. No, the U.S. government never lied to you, or covered up natural cures, or conspired with Big Pharma. GMOs were created by people who LOVE the ecosystem, too! That's the nonsense we're all supposed to believe, according to the mainstream media. By invoking the phrase 'conspiracy theories,' junk science authors and corporate-sellout journalists try to marginalize the true history of Big Pharma felony crimes, medical experiments on children, factual government collusion with industry and the incredible harm which has been perpetrated on the American people by the medical industrial complex. In fact, the mainstream media's coverage of all this is truly Orwellian, as if the Ministry of Truth is trying to rewrite U.S. history to eliminate all the parts where drug companies, the NIH and the U.S. government quite literally murdered prisoners, blacks, babies and soldiers in the name of 'scientific medicine.' I refuse to gloss over the history of TRUE medical conspiracies and all the lives lost to the destructive pursuit of medical profits at the expense of human dignity. So to answer the mainstream media's delusional attempt to gloss over the real history of true medical conspiracies, we've put together the top ten TRUE medical conspiracies along with links to sources. Read and learn the true history the mainstream media is trying to erase! Top ten TRUE medical conspiracies #1) Pfizer conducts medical experiments on Nigerian children - In 2009 (and in subsequent years, as follow-up), we reported on how giant drug maker Pfizer was ordered to compensate Nigerian families after conducting illegal medical experimentation that left scores of Nigerian children either deaddamaged : The case began in 1996, when Pfizer needed a human trial to gain approval for its new antibiotic Trovan. When an epidemic of meningitis, cholera and measles broke out in Kano, Nigeria, the company quickly put together a research team and flew them to that country. Pfizer set up a tent right near the medical station where Doctors Without Borders were giving free treatments and recruited 200 children to participate in an unlicensed drug trial. Parents say they were not told that proven medications were being distributed only yards away, that their children were being enrolled in a drug trial, or that animal studies had suggested that Trovan could cause liver and joint damage. Eleven of the 200 children in the study died, and parents claim that others suffered from brain damage, organ failure and other severe side effects. #2) Illegal price fixing to cheat the American people and state governments out of billions - Apparently, the Big Government / Big Pharma cabal in Washington would have you believe that drug makers only have your best interests in mind, not their profits or power. In fact, for years drug makers have regularly conspired to engage in illegal price fixing, as evidenced by numerous lawsuits and court. As I previously reported : In what is now the largest criminal fraud settlement ever to come out of the pharmaceutical industry, GlaxoSmithKline has pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $1 billion in criminal fines and $2 billion in civil fines following a nine-year federal investigation into its activities. According to U.S. federal investigators, GlaxoSmithKline: Routinely bribed doctors with luxury vacations and paid speaking gigs Fabricated drug safety data and lied to the FDA Defrauded Medicare and Medicaid out of billions Deceived regulators about the effectiveness of its drugs Relied on its deceptive practices to earn billions of dollars selling potentially dangerous drugs to unsuspecting consumers and medical patients And this is just the part they got caught doing. GSK doesn't even deny any of this. The company simply paid the $3 billion fine, apologized to its customers, and continued conducting business as usual. #3) Vaccine manufacturers knew their vaccines were killing people - One of Merck's top developers knew that the company's polio vaccines were heavily contaminated with carcinogenic viruses. The scientist, Dr. Maurice Hilleman, can be heard discussing it in this shocking video . He and other 'scientist' colleagues are actually heard on the recording laughing about the fact that the stealth viruses would kill people. The mainstream media has never reported on this important piece of medical history because it would expose the truth about vaccines. #4) Merck falsified vaccine evidence - A pair of former virologists publicly claimed that the company conspired to commit vaccine research fraud through the spiking of human blood samples with animal antibodies. As we reported in 2012 : The former Merck virologists contend that the multivalent mumps component has a vastly reduced efficacy which is directly responsible for mumps outbreaks during the last decade which prompted international calls for MMR booster shots every 4 - 8 years... By combining the very low levels of human antibodies with animal antibodies, a much higher total level of virus neutralization was obtained than could occur from human antibodies alone. The human antibody levels alone would never protect in the real world against wild mumps. But after adding animal antibodies, the human blood samples which had previously failed under the old 'gold standard' testing were retested using the 'enhanced' protocols and passed with flying colors. New 'enhanced' tests showed 100% efficacy, not against wild mumps virus, but against the mumps vaccine virus. #5) U.S. government collusion to commit medical murder - In what should shock all Americans to learn, the government-funded National Institutes of Health and a number of drug companies conspired to conduct illegal medical experiments on prisoners held in Guatemalan jails. President Obama was actually forced to issue a public apology for this atrocity more than sixty years after it took place. As selfnews previously reported : The U.S. government knowingly funded and deliberately engaged in criminal medical experiments against Guatemalan prisoners from 1946 - 1948, and that the people engaged in these crimes were then promoted to high levels of influence in the medical community. At least 5,500 people were drafted into the experiments, including children, women and the mentally ill. The number deliberately infected with sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) exceeded 1,300 (that we know of). Victims were not even informed they were being infected with STDs. The entire experiment was a clandestine operation involving an admitted conspiracy between Big Pharma and the U.S. government. Undeniable evidence has now emerged that the doctors and medical researchers involved in the experiment actively took steps to hide what they were doing. #6) Conspiracy to label toxic chemicals 'fluoride' and get the public to drink them - It is an historical fact that the fluoride and dental industries have conspired to mislead people into believe 'fluoride' is a naturally occurring substance. The fact is, the fluorine compounds used in the public water supply are really byproducts of fertilizer processing or phosphate mining operations, and they often contain heavy metals. Even many mainstream scientists now conclude that fluoride lowers IQs and damages the brain function of children . So why are we still being told that fluoride is a 'public health measure' that helps everyone? Attend any city council or other government agency deciding on whether or not to fluoridate your local water supply, and you'll get health officials asserting that fluoride is natural, and thus safe. They don't bother to mention that naturally occurring fluoride is calcium fluoride, while the stuff purchased by communities to fluoridate their water is sodium fluoride, an extremely toxic mix of hexafluorosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride. #7) GMO deceptions, lies and poisons - Without question, one of the true 'conspiracy theories' is that GMO foods are responsible for a wide range of health problems. We have published numerous articles and studies claiming as much, but the government-industry cabal, led by bio-agriculture giant Monsanto, still somehow insists that these Frankenfoods are 100 percent safe even though they are repeatedly linked to organ damage, stomach inflammation, infertility problems and more. The mainstream media wants you to believe that you are a 'conspiracy theorist' if you believe in biochemical cause and effect. Don't worry, Monsanto loves you! And so do pesticide companies, whose chemicals are so safe that you should be eating them for breakfast! #8) Academic suppression of important medical research - When good science gets published that questions the safety of GMOs, vaccines or fluoride, it gets routinely suppressed. That's exactly what happened to University of Caen molecular biology researcher Professor Gilles-Eric Seralini, whose two-year study into the effects of GMO corn on rats was (and continues to be) vilified by the establishment scientific community , which is entirely beholden to corporate financial influence. As selfnews reported: Before many could recover from the shock of seeing rats fed GMO corn with huge tumors, the mainstream press was already reporting scientists who claimed the French study was flawed. Ironically, a similar study of much shorter duration, 90 days, is what got Monsanto's NK 603 Roundup tolerant GMO maize (corn) and Roundup herbicide approved by the EFSA in the first place. Seralini merely extended the study using the same type of rats to determine the toxic effects of feeding them GMO corn for two years. He also added a glyphosate herbicide solution into their drinking water at a level approved as safe for Roundup's water contamination. Meanwhile, Dr. Arpad Pusztai was a highly regarded UK biology researcher at the prestigious Rowett Institute, a Scottish nutritional laboratory. He was awarded a grant to establish a safety protocol for GMO foods with his 20-member research team. He never expected to find anything wrong with the GMO potatoes studied, but he did. Within days of publishing the team's findings, he was dismissed from the position he had held for decades. #9) The massive academic fraud and conspiracy to discredit Dr. Andrew Wakefield by spreading provably false lies about his research - There has been a massive, organized 'scientific' conspiracy to discredit Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the researcher who examined the effects of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines in children. Though his research never claimed that vaccines cause autism , he is routinely defamed and disparaged by an endless list of intellectually dishonest scientists and journalists who falsely claim Dr. Wakefield linked vaccines to autism. In fact, his research was actually focused on gastrointestinal effects of the vaccines in children, but he was attacked nonetheless: Contrary to what the UK's General Medical Council (GMC), BMJ, Brian Deer, and the host of whoring media outlets continue to claim, Dr. Wakefield's original study was a case series that made no actual claims about a definitive link between MMR and autism. And the observations, which do happen to suggest a link between MMR and autism regression, are not just unique to Dr. Wakefield's research. Professor Walker-Smith and Dr. Amar Dhillon together documented their own independent research that also points to a link between MMR vaccine and autism. Watch the powerful interview with Dr. Wakefield here: http://tv.selfnews.com/v.asp?v=608256A446... #10) Local governments routinely conspire to with medical institutions to threaten parents and children - Local government 'authorities' routinely conspire with the medical industry to force parents to vaccinate their children or subject them to harsh medical treatment against their will. This is all done essentially at gunpoint (or by threat of arrest and imprisonment, which is enforced at gunpoint). - In Ohio, a court forced the parents of an Amish girl to undergo poisonous chemotherapy: http://www.selfnews.com/042393_akron_chil... . As selfnews published: This is, essentially, chemotherapy at gunpoint or what I call 'predatory medicine.' If the parents refuse the court order, they will be arrested at gunpoint and charged with various crimes. The Akron Children's Hospital, which stands to profit from this decision, is the new medical mafia, poisoning children with mandatory 'life sentences' handed down by a corrupt, medically ignorant justice system. - Katie Wernecke , a teenage cancer patient who was kidnapped by Texas authorities and forced to submit to chemotherapy, is another victim of the system. Her parents were arrested and subjected to actions by Child Protective Services, who took Katie away. This all happened because Katie's parents refused to subject their daughter to chemotherapy and wanted to pursue safer, more natural holistic medical therapies. - Abraham Cherrix is a 16-year old cancer patient who also refused a second round of chemotherapy after the first round nearly killed him. His doctor was outraged that Abraham would refuse chemotherapy and called Child Protective Services who had Abraham's parents arrested at gunpoint. CPS then took over joint custody of the child and attempted to force the teen to submit to barbaric cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy.

This is by design to extract as much money from the U.S. economy as possible while keeping the population diseased and impoverished. - In 1980, total health care costs accounted for 9.5 percent of all personal consumption; by 2011, that amount rose to 16.3 percent ( http://www.businessinsider.com/america-middl... ) - Medical bills factor in more than 60 percent of U.S. bankruptcies ( http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/05/bankrup... ) - In the last 10 years, health insurance premiums have risen three times faster than wages ( http://www.businessinsider.com/depressing-fa... ) - Top executives at the five biggest for-profit insurance companies in the U.S. combined to earn north of $200 million in 2009 ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/hea... ) -- Even as Americans were mired in the Great Recession, health insurance companies bolstered profits by 56 percent (in 2009, the same year more than 2 million lost private coverage) ( http://abcnews.go.com/Health/HealthCare/heal... ) - Each year nearly a million people are rushed to emergency rooms following adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-galland-md... ). - In 2009, there were an astonishing 1,742 prescription drug recalls ( http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/16/news/compani... ) - The legal system is also bumping up costs; one recent study found that lawsuits and other legal actions added more than $55 billion to national healthcare costs in 2008 ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/39037984 ). - Big Pharma spends tens of billions each year in marketing and advertising; who wants to lose out on that gravy train?

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Renegade Water Secrets, which can be found at ( http://www.renegadewatersecrets.com ) . In this excerpt, David Wolfe shares on bottled water and using water to make other drinks. Renegade Water Secrets with David Wolfe, author of the new book Amazing Grace and Eating for Beauty and many others. Kevin: What are some of the best bottled waters that you experienced? It's obviously not the best compared to the spectrum that we're talking about here, but obviously when you're traveling or you're on a plane or something like that, sometimes you just need water. Is it more important to have water than it is to have pure filtered water? Do you know what I mean? David: I think if you're going to be traveling around and you want to grab something off the shelf, you're first preference should be for glass bottled water. Glasses are recyclable material. If you break a piece of glass, for example, it will eventually be turned into sand over a period of a hundred years as it erodes down. It's completely friendly to the environment, it doesn't out gas like plastic does with toxic chemicals into the water and I like to support companies that still produce glass bottled water because its rare and one thing we don't need more of is more plastic on the planet. Companies that I like are Volvic Water, which does a good glass bottled water. Voss Water does a good glass bottled water and even Evian does a good glass bottled water and those are always my first pick. If you're going to get on the internet and you want to hunt down where to find the best glass bottled water there is, there's no question that it is the stuff that's coming out of Austria. So the best bottled water that's on the internet is Grander Water and you can go to ( www.grander.com ) and you'll see that he has these one liter bottle sizes. Not only is that water just phenomenal and properly bottled and it's a spring that's properly tapped, but the glass itself is magnetically treated to keep the water charged. Kevin: Wow. Let's talk a little bit about tea , because water and tea, you need water to make tea and as you can probably explain better, it's a great way to bring extra nutrients and extra herbal tinctures into your system. David: This is how I do it at home, there's only so much water that you really want to drink before you finally go, this is boring. Because there's a point of boredom where it's like, I don't really want to drink water anymore. I'd like to have something else. What's a great something else? I like to create on a wood burning stove here, teas that are made out of herbs from our forest. We'll just put it in there and I'll do a little vortexing in there and the wood burning stove has a different kind of radiant than an electrical stove or a gas stove and it treats water better and from there we'll create the teas and literally I'll be drinking the teas all day. What I find is that it keeps me hydrated, number one; number two, because I'm on spring water, I'm getting more spring water movement through my body which is what I want because I'm achieving that goal as well. Three, you're getting medicinal value out of it. You're not just getting water. You're also getting some of the medicines, for example, that's in reishi mushroom which is the one that I like to make tea out of or maitake mushroom is another one that grows here that we're making tea out of, so when all those factors are taken together, the tea idea really starts to make sense and we probably can see why the great herbalist were tea drinkers. Kevin: What temperature should you be conscious about heating it to, so you don't destroy some properties of the water? David: That's an excellent question. That is a really good question. The flash point of water appears to be about 170 degrees. Here's how this was discovered. It was discovered that if you heat water beyond... say you heat water beyond 170 to 190 degrees. You boil the water, then you cool it down, then you drink it. Your body will actually generate a white blood cell reaction to that water. Let's say you heat it up only to 150 degrees and then cooled it back down and then drank it. Your body generates no white blood cell reaction. The response by the human body is kind of an immune system response to an intruder or a foreign object and through that research, the number of 170 degrees was arrived at. Kevin: Do you just want to make sure you keep it at a low temperature for how ever long your steeping what you're putting in? David: Right and you see herbalists say you can't get the medicinal compounds out of whatever unless you boil it and I completely disagree. I completely disagree about that with the mushrooms. I'm a mushroom hunter. I make mushroom teas everyday. Every herbalist that I knew when I was a kid - Chinese medical doctors said you have to boil it, you have to boil it. I never boil it and it's perfectly fine. In fact, it's the best ever. Kevin: You already mentioned maitake and reishi. What are some of your favorite tea concoctions that you've created? David: A great one is goji berry, vanilla bean, Pau d'Arco, which is a bark from Central America. It's an awesome, awesome plant. They use to make bows and arrows out of it. Cat's claw, that's a great one and Nettles tea, Horsetail tea. You can use these individually or combine them all together. So that would be goji berry, vanilla, Pau d'Arco, cat's claw, nettles and horsetail. Those are amazing. Kevin: What are some of the benefits of some of those nettles? Particularly, Pau d'Arco and cat's claw... David: That's a good question. Since we're talking about silica, horsetail and nettles are super high in silica and therefore, they have an ability to help you with your bone density for example. Let's talk about Pau d'Arco. Pau d'Arco is a very powerful antifungal. Cat's claw is a very powerful antiviral. Vanilla bean just is like a feel good food and goji berry has immune system polysaccharides in it and this all comes out into the water when you make tea out of these things. You can make a super immune tonic tea for yourself everyday... Get all your water needs met and be happy to do it and that to me is where I'm at with it. I think that's where I want to be. I want to be happy with what I'm doing. I don't want to force myself to drink water or too much water. I want to go and enjoy the process. Kevin: Yeah, that's great. Anyone who's searching for nettles, please use gloves. I've made the mistake of not using gloves and just saying 'oh, is this a nettle'. Oh my gosh, what a nightmare. Let's kind of wrap this up. We have about five more minutes. I want to talk about what, if we can recap, the steps someone can take to maybe on a scale of spring water to tap water and what they can do to start getting moving and really improve quality of the water and improve the quality of their life. That's what it's really about. David: Right. First step is just being conscious and aware that water likes certain things and it doesn't like certain things. Water likes to move in a meandering way. Water likes to be moved in a vortex or spiral. Anytime that you can spiral water for example, is a good thing. I would also recommend just being aware that water has a consciousness and that if your goal is to be ennobled with that, your consciousness will cause you to treat water differently. The way we treat water in this world is appalling really. We use 100,000 gallons just to make pure water. I mean, how many people could drink from that water? This is kind of where we've got to go in the future where we clean up our rivers, we clean up our streams and we get back to normal so to speak. Definitely every bit of the intention along the way from let's say on a municipal system, every bit of intention that you put onto the water from the time the water comes into your house all the way to the time it comes out of your faucet or your shower, it is valuable and I believe that the water responds to it. For example, you can put a filtration mechanism on the intake of the house that all of a sudden you have no chlorine coming out in your house -- in the water in your house -- and that's a great step. Another thing might be to put a Kangen System right on there before you drink it. Another deal might be to take the Kangen water and go ahead and put a little bit of Dr. Flanagan's crystal energy in there with a little bit of maybe sea salt and then spin that up and then drink that. Each step is important and it is not overkill. Well, I'm kind of a water... I'm kind of a... I feel like I'm a... how do I want to... Kevin: Connoisseur? David: I feel like I'm the messenger for the spirit of fresh, pure, clean water and water with intentions and therefore, I want to always go the extra step to make sure that that water is happy as kind of metaphysical as that sounds, there's an effect. That's why I keep doing it. If I didn't feel good, I wouldn't keep doing it. Kevin: That's probably the best way to end this call. Well, I want to thank you so much for coming on board and sharing your knowledge. It's been insightful and I know how important your time is. I really appreciate it. David: Thanks so much, Kevin. It's been awesome. I hope everybody gets to drink the best water ever... Kevin: Why don't you tell a little bit about where someone can find more information about you?

0," Vitamin D may reduce prostate cancer risk by acting on a gene that lowers inflammation, according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado Cancer Center and published in the journal Prostate . Back in 1990, scientists first suggested that vitamin D might be the common variable linking a number of known prostate cancer risk factors, including older age (associated with reduced vitamin D synthesis), living at a northern latitude (where people are more likely to be vitamin D-deficient due to lower levels of the sunlight that stimulates synthesis of the vitamin) and African descent (because darker skin leads to reduced vitamin D synthesis). In addition, studies had shown that prostate cancers diagnosed in the summer or autumn, when vitamin D levels in the body tend to be highest, were less deadly than those diagnosed in the winter or spring. Prostate cancer levels are also known to be low in Japan, where people tend to consume high levels of soy and fatty fish rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s make vitamin D more stable in the body, while soy makes it remain active longer. More recently, researchers have found that vitamin D supplementation might slow the progression of prostate cancer, and that many prostate cancer cells contain receptors for vitamin D. Inflammation is the key The new study sought to clarify the role of vitamin D by understanding exactly how it affects prostate cancer cells. 'When you take Vitamin D and put it on prostate cancer cells, it inhibits their growth,' researcher James R. Lambert, PhD, said. 'But it hasn't been proven as an anti-cancer agent. We wanted to understand what genes Vitamin D is turning on or off in prostate cancer to offer new targets.' Prior research had indicated that vitamin D increases the expression of a gene known as GDF-15, which codes for a specific protein. Yet, when the researchers looked more closely at GDF-15 expression, it seemed to have no connection with prostate cancer . 'We thought there might be high levels of GDF-15 in normal tissue and low levels in prostate cancer,' Lambert said, 'but we found that in a large cohort of human prostate tissue samples, expression of GDF-15 did not track with either normal or cancerous prostate tissue.' When the researchers added in the variable of inflammation , however, the picture changed radically. They found that GDF-15 levels were lowest in prostate cells with the most inflammation. 'Inflammation is thought to drive many cancers including prostate, gastric and colon,' Lambert said. 'Therefore, GDF-15 may be a good thing in keeping prostate tissue healthy -- it suppresses inflammation, which is a bad actor potentially driving prostate cancer.' The solution to drug ineffectiveness? The researchers also found that GDF-15 expression inhibited another gene, called NFkB. This gene has been shown in other studies to increase inflammation and to contribute to tumor formation and growth. Yet all efforts to dampen the activity of NFkB with drug treatments have been unsuccessful so far. The new study suggests that upregulating GDF-15 -- perhaps by a mechanism as simple as increased sunlight exposure -- could be a better strategy. 'There's been a lot of work on inhibiting NFkB,' said Lambert. 'Now from this starting point of Vitamin D in prostate cancer, we've come a long way toward understanding how we might use GDF-15 to target NFkB, which may have implications in cancer types far beyond prostate.' Research is increasingly linking vitamin D to a lower risk of cancer, autoimmune disease and other chronic diseases. Doctors recommend that light-skinned people get at least 15 minutes of unprotected sun exposure on their face and hands daily; people with darker skin and those living far from the equator may need two to three times as much exposure.

0," With preparations being made for the massive Jade Helm 15 military training across the American Southwest -- exercises that imagine conservative Texas and Utah as 'hostile' and more liberal states as 'permissive' -- the increasingly discredited establishment media has dishonestly seized on a handful of theories and comments to attack everyone expressing concerns about the drills. It is true that some unproven and in some cases wild claims have been made by a handful of individuals online, such as the notion that closed Walmart stores are involved in a nefarious plot with authorities to detain dissidents. However, in its deceitful efforts to demonize Americans who are suspicious of the Obama administration and the unprecedented Jade Helm 15 program, the mischaracterized 'mainstream' press has seized on those claims as if they represented the primary or even only concerns being expressed. In the process, it exposed itself as a propaganda machine. (Story by Alex Newman, republished from TheNewAmerican.com ) It is hardly a surprise that many Americans have expressed concerns about Jade Helm 15. Polls show more than two thirds of Americans believe the federal government is 'out of control' and a threat to liberty. The other third must not be paying attention. Plus, just the information that is publicly known about the military exercise is enough to raise alarm bells. Special Forces troops, for example, will be wandering through the streets of American towns with military weapons. Elite soldiers dressed in civilian clothes and driving civilian vehicles, in coordination with local law enforcement, will be seeking to 'blend in' with local communities without being detected. The fact that multiple conservative U.S. states are being identified as 'hostile,' too, is bizarre, to say the least -- especially considering the argument that the drill is to train for 'overseas' operations. All of that combined with recent developments -- numerous federal reports identifying conservatives and Christians as extremists or even potential terrorists, Obama's troubling history and background of anti-American extremism, the White House's dismal track record on honesty, and more -- have sparked legitimate concerns across America and especially Texas about Jade Helm 15. The concerns expressed by outraged citizens in town hall meetings and online were so serious and widespread that Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor the exercise. 'During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed,' Abbott wrote in the order to the Texas military commander.

0," Foods that feed Candida cause inflammation by feeding Candida, but these and many other foods cause inflammation in other ways, too. Some foods have natural, and naturally beneficial inflammatory properties, like many omega 6 fats. But these fats are not 'bad,' they promote the healing process. These days, most people know about sugar and its inflammatory properties (at least those who read these types of articles), but that's not just restricted to white sugar. Sugars feed Candida and almost all other well-known infectious microbes as well, and causes inflammation in other ways too. Almost everyone has too much sugar in their diet. When healing the gut, it's important to cut out sweets, including fruit juices (even fresh, slow pressed), honey (even raw), agave, brown rice syrup, and all other sweeteners with the exception of stevia. Acid Forming Foods (Generally Refined Foods) When fiber and minerals are removed from foods (like table sugar, salt, and white rice), many of the minerals that alkalinize the body and the beneficial fats are also removed. It's imperative to cut out all other refined carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, other refined flours, and any processed starches. GMOs and Pesticide Laden Conventional Foods Pesticides, herbicides, and GMO foods kill good gut bacteria. Candida will bounce back, along with other infectious microbes, because the gut becomes inhospitable to our naturally beneficial flora as the toxic food keeps coming in. Factory Farmed Animal Products Factory farmed animals are raised on genetically modified grains that are already on the inflammatory side of the spectrum, even without being genetically modified. For instance corn, wheat, oats, hay, and certain grasses are inflammatory, especially when they are not balanced with a wider variety of natural foods within the diet. Wheat, Bread, Gluten Today, due to hybridization, there is a new kind of gluten molecule that we ingest. This gluten molecule in our wheat is more inflammatory than previous varieties. It's not the only gluten molecule in bread, but it's prominent, and it's not found in ancient wheat strands. 'Bad' Fats Most informed people know by now that coconut and avocado and plenty of other fats have tremendous healing properties and do not naturally contribute to obesity. The bad fats are commercial, highly processed fats, rancid fats, trans fats, and otherwise unnatural fats. These fats cause inflammation and contribute to every autoimmune disease. Other Toxic Ingredients Soy lecithin, casein, and protein isolates generally have heavy omega 6 profiles and are also very acidifying. Excitotoxins like MSG, and aspartate, glutamates, aspartate, and MSG excite nerves, damaging the nervous system. Inflammation and Free Radicals Free radicals are created by our natural everyday functions, and they play many important roles, including the elimination of the weakest cells in the adjacent area (like infectious microbes). But too much inflammation means way too many free radicals that are overwhelming the body, impeding healing. Specific Nutrient Deficiencies Known To Cause Inflammation Any nutrient deficiency can cause inflammation one way or another. Two common nutrition deficiencies well known to directly cause inflammation include: Vitamin D deficiency is linked to depression, pain, increased overall inflammation, an ineffective immune system, inflammatory bowel disease, many different autoimmune diseases, many forms of cancer, and so much more. Vitamin B deficiencies can cause, exacerbate, and also be the result of inflammation. When the body's digestive system isn't healthy, B vitamin assimilation becomes more difficult, and extra B vitamins often give some almost immediate relief to those suffering from inflammation. This is especially important for anyone dealing with an abundance of stress. Conclusion Whole foods, foods that have no need for an ingredients list, heal the body. There are lots of conditions that cause allergic reactions, sensitivities, or other inflammatory responses from otherwise healthy foods . For instance, someone with severe hypothyroidism may worsen with the consumption of cruciferous vegetables. The problem with eliminating whole, healthy foods in the diet is that the nutrient deficiencies that are at the cause of the problem get worse. Remove all unhealthy foods from the diet. Temporarily remove some healthier foods if you must, but add them back in as soon as you are able. See the first source below for more on inflammation (this is the short version).

0," Millions of Americans spray it on their bodies in the summertime to avoid getting mosquito bites, but the popular insect repellant chemical DEET appears to be going the way of antibiotics in losing its efficacy over time. A recent study published in the journal PLoS One reveals that mosquitoes are becoming increasingly less responsive to DEET, and are even now learning how to shut off their senses when exposed to it. For their research, Dr. James Logan and his colleagues from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine studied the effects of DEET on the Aedes aegypti mosquito type, which is known to bite during the day and transmit deadly diseases like yellow fever and dengue fever. Dr. Logan and his team exposed the mosquitoes to small amounts of DEET, and tracked their behavior throughout the course of several hours. What they observed is that, following three hours after exposure, many of the mosquitoes were no longer averse to DEET as they were during the first three hours. As it turns out, even minimal exposure to DEET resulted in the mosquitoes developing a type of immunity to the chemical, which was observed to no longer be effective beyond three hours after exposure. 'We think that the mosquitoes are habituating to the repellant, similar to a phenomenon seen with the human sense of smell also,' explains Dr. Logan about his findings. 'Our study shows that the effects of this exposure last up to three hours,' he adds, noting that mosquitoes previously exposed to DEET eventually adapt to it, and are no longer affected by it. It is believed that the sensory receptors of mosquitoes gradually shut down following exposure to DEET, which results in the creatures no longer being able to smell or sense it. As a result, these DEET-exposed mosquitoes are likely to return to human skin that has already been sprayed with DEET and try to tap it for blood, as if it had never been sprayed in the first place. The findings build upon earlier research by Dr. Logan, which hypothesized a genetic factor that resulted in some mosquitoes not responding to DEET. As reported by Nature back in 2010, some mosquito types have actually evolved to overcome the intended effects of DEET, thanks to a dominant gene that is sometimes passed down through mosquito families. 'That there might actually be a gene lurking in the background in mosquitoes that causes DEET resistance is the single most surprising result,' said Leslie Vosshall of Rockefeller University in New York City to Nature about the earlier study. 'This hasn't really been reported before.' "
0," The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), more infamously known as Obamacare, is once again in the news due to a lack of foresight in developing and writing this law. The problem is a lack of qualified physicians to treat the newly insured and the millions more to follow. Somehow, the architects of Obamacare failed to properly address this critical topic when formulating HR 3962. A December 7 AP article described the healthcare plight of 61-year-old Olivia Papa as she has struggled to be seen by a primary care physician after signing up for insurance through the ACA exchange. Though relatively healthy, she and her husband needed to see separate specialists, so she called the doctor assigned to her, only to find out that the doctor wasn't on the plan. A new doctor was assigned, but the result was the same; she left a message to make an appointment, 'and they never called back.' Physician shortage identified years ago made far worse by Obamacare The shortage of physicians was identified as an impending issue by numerous healthcare organizations some years ago based on pre-Obamacare physician and population trends. Several studies noted that there would be shortages in primary care physicians as well as in the fields of geriatrics, pediatrics and general surgery. Instead of addressing the problem with a coherent plan, Obamacare created a policy that amounts to putting a band-aid on a compound fracture. The issue was identified in a 2012 report [PDF] by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The report clearly identifies the legislative issues that Obamacare failed to address, including physician training: Physician training is inextricable from patient care and Medicare has historically paid for its share of the costs of training and the highly sophisticated health services provided by teaching hospitals. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 capped Medicare-funded GME at 1996 levels for almost all teaching hospitals and continues to limit teaching hospital efforts to expand or create new programs. The ACA did not eliminate the cap but allowed for the training of approximately 300 additional physicians a year--far fewer than the 10,000 additional physicians the nation would need to train annually to address the entire physician shortage. An estimated 6.7 million people signed up for health insurance through the ACA exchange for 2014. Estimates vary, but a total of 26 to 32 million people are projected to enroll through the exchange in the coming years. Projected physician shortages are potential healthcare disaster for baby boomers The projected shortage of physicians through 2020 is 91,500, with 45,400 of those being primary care physicians, and 46,100 subspecialists, according to the AAMC. Another factor apparently not considered by the Obamacare architects: Starting in 2011, 8,000 Americans are turning 65 each day, and this will continue through 2029, says the American Association for Retired Persons (AARP) . The lack of primary care physicians and geriatric subspecialists is a potential healthcare disaster for the baby boomer generation. Anthony Halby, an insurance agent in a rural area near Sacramento, California, explained the choices that his clients face is one of cost versus coverage, according to the AP article. Several of his clients told him that they want to switch their plan when the second open-enrollment period started October 15, because the plan they had initially selected made it difficult to find primary care doctors. Two insurance companies serving the area offer coverage through the state exchange, but only five of 135 primary care physicians in the area are available through one of the insurers. The other insurer has more doctors, but most of them are considered to be out of the network, so his clients will have to pay 60 percent of the bill if they see them. Halby has recommended to his clients that they choose insurance outside the exchange. They will have to pay more, since the plan isn't government-subsidized, but they will get to keep their primary care physician. Quoted in the AP article, Halby said, 'Coverage does not equal access.' That must have been what Nancy Pelosi meant when she said that HR 3962 would have to pass so we would know what's in it.

0," In the prescient 1984 tome, author George Orwell wrote about a supposedly 'fictitious' future in which the civilized world lived in what can only be called a surveillance society , in which 'the government' would be able to keep watch on the citizenry 24-7, and through a variety of technological means. It turns out that Orwell's premonitions were a lot more realistic than even he likely imagined. Today, surveillance cameras are everywhere, at least in the modern world. Police have a range of listening devices and surveillance technology, some of which can see through your walls and into your home . And federal spy agencies like the NSA routinely intercept and track Internet and wireless communications. Now, it seems, even your household goods can spy on you. As reported by Britain's Daily Mail , you might want to keep a lid on what you say this evening when you sit down in front of your television. Samsung has issued a warning to owners of its Internet-connected 'smart TV' -- anything they say while sitting in the vicinity of the device could be overheard. As the Mail reported further: The popular televisions are voice activated, so users can switch channels or ask for suggestions of what to watch simply by giving a verbal command. However, the technology which allows this to happen has a worrying side effect: it records everything else that goes on near the television. Privacy? What privacy? According to a clause in Samsung's privacy policy, buyers should beware: 'Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party.' For instance, that means that the TVs might be able to record a family argument that took place in the living room; executives discussing strategy in corporate boardrooms equipped with such smart TVs are at risk of sharing confidential information. Privacy advocates are understandably upset and concerned, noting that the technology is ripe for abuse by government agencies and 'Big Brother' in general (coincidentally, the name of the authoritarian state in Orwell's novel). 'This thing is going to be in your house, listening in on you,' Renate Samson, of Big Brother Watch, a campaign group named after this very notion, said, as quoted by the Mail . 'Samsung say they are providing you with a service, but really the only service you need from a television is to watch programmes.' More than half of all smart TVs sold in Britain are made by Samsung, the Mail noted. The problem is in the technology, which was sold as a convenience. The TVs 'listen' for simple commands, such as those to switch channels or turn up the volume. But it can process more complicated commands as well, after recording users' speech and sending it on to a third-party company called Nuance, which is located in the U.S. Nuance then sends the voice data to a computer server, which then translates the spoken word into text and spits out a response. As further reported by the Daily Mail : To give these complex commands, viewers must press a button on the remote control as they speak, and during that time, anything within 'earshot' will be collected. The data is encrypted, but can be listened to by authorised Nuance staff. The technology giant remained tight-lipped about whether it then keeps users' data, only saying that it does not sell information on, and that it operates within privacy laws, which vary by country. Professor Peter Sommer, a digital forensics expert who has lectured at the London School of Economics, said there was 'no reason' Samsung would not be storing up data. 'The fear is they could be building up a pattern of your preferences, or learning your voice,' he told the Mail . Even when interactivity is turned off, the TV can collect data Users do have the option of stopping the recording of their conversations by Samsung; they can turn the voice recognition feature off. But even then, the South Korean-based technology giant can still collect some information. 'While Samsung will not collect your spoken word, Samsung may still collect associated texts and other usage data so that we can evaluate the performance of the feature and improve it,' says the company's privacy statement. The Samsung smart TVs are not the only video and television technology capable of monitoring your activity. As selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported last year, Amazon Fire TV (and similar services) has the capability to act as a spying device. Read his full report here .

0," Helicopter pilot Steve Irwin recently caught an amazing aerial view of what he says were tens of thousands of sharks congregating just south of Palm Beach, Florida. Though it is common for sharks to migrate from colder to warmer waters this time of year, what Irwin saw was nothing short of strange, as he said that countless sharks were circling around in waters where there were no visible bait-fish. 'It was truly an amazing sight,' Irwin told reporters at the U.K. Daily Mail . 'I've been a fisherman for 20 years and I also kayak out there and it's common to see [sharks] twist and turn and shoot through the air. They're prevalent at this time of year but what amazed me was the sheer numbers of them.' Owner and operator of Island Marine Services in Fort Pierce, Fla., Irwin estimates that an astounding 100,000 sharks were densely packed in the shallow waters about 100 yards off the coastline for at least 20 straight miles. But the circumstances of the event are confusing, explained Irwin, because there was no specific reason why the sharks decided to stop in the area for so long. 'It's common to see large predatory sharks come in and feed on schools of bait-fish,' he said. 'The odd thing was I didn't see any bait-fish at all!' This shark phenomenon could be somehow related to the many other strange events involving animals, including the unexplained fish and bird deaths that have occurred in recent months ( http://www.selfnews.com/030985_mysterious... ). However, it is difficult to say at this point whether or not there is any correlation, as the increase in shark numbers and lack of bait-fish could just be a simple coincidence.

0," It's not normal to die at age 32 of a heart attack. To make that happen, you normally have to be taking chemical substances of some kind, either recreational drugs or prescription drugs. Actress Brittany Murphy, who died this last weekend from a heart attack, was reportedly taking prescription drugs to treat the symptoms of the flu (not to actually treat the flu itself, mind you, just the symptoms of the flu). She was found collapsed in her shower after her heart gave out. If prescription drugs are the cause, this would be just the latest celebrity death caused by pharmaceuticals. Other celebrity deaths recently caused by pharmaceuticals include: Heath Ledger http://www.selfnews.com/022602_drugs_Heat... Patrick Swayze http://www.selfnews.com/027030_cancer_che... Bernie Mac http://www.selfnews.com/023817_Bernie_Mac... Michael Jackson http://www.selfnews.com/026517_Michael_Ja... Farrah Fawcett http://www.selfnews.com/026511_cancer_che... And from the realm of politics and the media, the following celebrities have also been killed by pharmaceuticals: Tony Snow http://www.selfnews.com/023626_cancer_che... Tim Russert http://www.selfnews.com/023434.html Peter Jennings If you add it all up and include all the non-celebrities killed by Big Pharma, these dangerous prescription medications are racking up a body count that makes terrorists look like amateurs. Pharmaceutical industry is a giant fraud The pharmaceutical industry, as operated today, is based almost entirely on scientific fraud, bribery of doctors, misleading advertising and corrupt regulatory agencies like the FDA. Most prescription medications simply don't help most people . They only mask symptoms while ignoring the underlying causes of disease. Nearly all pharmaceuticals are sold with the Big Lie ... the implied (but false) promise that 'These drugs will make you healthier.' That's why drug ads always show happy, healthy people popping their pills. (Well, technically they never even show them popping the pills. They just show them doing yoga, hiking in the woods, or whatever looks good.) I can't think of a single pharmaceutical that actually makes you healthier. Almost universally, prescription medications cause long-term damage to the heart, liver, kidneys and nervous system. Over time, they erode your health , accelerate your apparent aging and promote chronic degenerative disease. Nutrients can make you healthier and prevent disease, but pharmaceuticals have no such abilities. That's because the human body was never designed to digest patented chemicals. It was, as you probably learned in high school health class, designed solely to digest natural foods and nutrients provided by Mother Nature. Of course, pharmaceuticals are very seductive. The idea that you can pop a pill and have all your health problems corrected is very appealing to many people. This is perhaps what got into Brittany Murphy . She mistakenly believed FDA-approved drugs would protect her health when, in reality, they took her life. selfnews mourns her death and hopes that others will learn the truth about dangerous prescription drugs and seek out safer, more natural alternatives that can save their lives. Why celebrities need really good nutrition Being a celebrity is extremely stressful and demanding. The long work hours, lack of time in nature, sunlight deficiency, frequent travel and poor sleep quality all add up to a lifestyle that can devastate your health. That's why celebrities, more than almost anyone, need to pursue a super clean diet with lots of superfoods. Only through very powerful, potent foods can celebrities hope to maintain anything close to a healthy life while under the stresses of celebrity existence. (And make no mistake, being a celebrity is harder than you think. The stresses are unbelievable...) The smart celebrities are already on natural diets -- Woody Harrelson, Suzanne Somers, Daryl Hannah and so on. They will tend to far out-live others who pursue extremely stressful lifestyles while trying to survive on a diet of processed foods and FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. There is no doubt in my mind that Brittany Murphy's life could have been saved by reading selfnews . If she had been taking vitamin D supplements, immune-boosting herbs and following a diet of healthy superfoods, she would very likely still be alive today. That's just my opinion, of course, as I don't yet know all the medical details about her death, but for someone to die of a heart attack at age 32, their health has to be severely compromised in one or more significant ways. The sad part is that the conventional medical industry never tells people the truth about nutrition and disease prevention, so even people who consider themselves to be 'well informed' are lacking basic knowledge about vitamin D, minerals, phytonutrients, living foods, superfoods and so on. To my knowledge, Brittany was not known as a health food person, so she most likely followed conventional health information (junk food, drugs and surgery). And that's almost certainly what killed her.

0," The anti-impotence drug Viagra actually reduces men's fertility by decreasing the ability of their sperm to fertilize an egg, according to a study conducted by researchers at Queen's University Belfast and published in the journal Fertility and Sterility . Researchers carried out two different experiments to determine what effect the popular drug might have on sperm cells. In the first study, human sperm samples were bathed in weak Viagra solutions, intended to approximate the blood concentration acquired from taking a single 100-milligram Viagra pill. They found that while the Viagra-bathed sperm became more active, they also suffered damage to the structure at their heads known as the acrosome. This portion of the cell contains enzymes that help break down the membrane around an egg so that the sperm can penetrate it. To determine if this cell damage actually affected fertility rates, the researchers compared the fertility of two groups of male mice, one of which had been given Viagra. They found that mice in the Viagra group produced 40 percent fewer fertilized embryos than mice that had not been given any drugs. Researcher David Glenn noted that the many fertility clinics that prescribe Viagra in order to increase sperm counts may actually be harming the fertility of their clients. 'I think it is worrying that some in-vitro fertilization clinics are using Viagra in order to boost fertility results,' Glenn said. 'Couples that go there for treatment are, by definition, already having problems getting pregnant. Giving male partners something that could make the problem worse is scarcely the right approach.' Glenn also expressed concern over the long-term effects that recreational Viagra use might have on people's fertility . 'Viagra has become a widely used recreational drug,' Glenn said. 'It is mixed with cocaine, for example, and is sold in clubs. Our work leaves open the possibility that there could be a cumulative effect from taking Viagra, however, which could pose serious fertility problems in later life.' "
0," At the same time that Monsanto's corruption is infiltrating every corner of U.S. academia, government regulators and corporate-controlled media, Russia has just announced a total ban on the cultivation of GMO crops. 'A senior Russian government member told reporters the cabinet decided that any food production in the country will completely exclude any genetically-modified organisms or parts thereof,' reports RT.com . RT reports: According to official statistics the share of GMO in the Russian food industry has declined from 12 percent to just 0.01 percent over the past 10 years, and currently there are just 57 registered food products containing GMO in the country. The law ordering obligatory state registration of GMO products that might contact with the environment will come into force in mid-2017. This puts Russia in a powerful position of producing nearly 100% non-GMO foods for both domestic consumption and export. Most consumers around the world, when given a choice, prefer to eat non-GMO foods. In the United States, the criminally-run food industry front group -- the Grocery Manufacturers of America -- is desperately trying to block all GMO food labeling in order to keep consumers in the dark about what they're eating. Nearly the entire mainstream media, likewise, has also been bought off by the biotech industry and refuses to cover the truth about GMOs. (Which is why sites like GMO.news are becoming so popular among independent thinkers. Hungary also rejecting America's Monsanto imperialism to produce GMO-free food for Europe Hungary is also working hard to produce GMO-free food products for its own people. As reported on GMO.news : Hungarys Ministry of Agriculture believes that keeping Hungarian agriculture GMO-free is a matter of extremely high strategic importance. In fact, Hungarys Constitution states that: Hungary shall promote the effective application of the right referred to in Paragraph (1) by an agriculture free of genetically modified organisms, by ensuring access to healthy food and drinking water, by organising safety at work and healthcare provision, by supporting sports and regular physical exercise, as well as by ensuring the protection of the environment. Monsanto has infiltrated every institution in America: academic, media, government... Monsanto, widely known as the world's most evil corporation, has turned the United States into a massive GMO experiment by recruiting a literal mafia of academics by offering them monetary bribes disguised as 'grants.' The University of Florida's disgraced agricultural scientist Dr. Kevin Folta was recently exposed for financial collusion with Monsanto -- a fact that even the New York Times could not ignore . See the full document dump of Kevin Folta's once-secret emails with Monsanto at this link . Monsanto's genetically modified seeds not only pose a risk of runaway genetic pollution and the collapse of food crops; the heavy use of cancer-causing glyphosate goes hand in hand with GM crops. Glyphosate is the deadly chemical that the Seralini study showed causing the growth of massive tumors in lab rats: Here are some of the shocking findings from the Seralini study which was, of course, viciously attacked by the Monsanto Mafia and its cabal of paid-off, corrupt scientists: Up to 50% of males and 70% of females suffered premature death. Rats that drank trace amounts of Roundup (at levels legally allowed in the water supply) had a 200% to 300% increase in large tumors. Rats fed GM corn and traces of Roundup suffered severe organ damage including liver damage and kidney damage. The study fed these rats NK603, the Monsanto variety of GM corn that's grown across North America and widely fed to animals and humans. This is the same corn that's in your corn-based breakfast cereal, corn tortillas and corn snack chips. Learn more about the scientific evidence showing the dangers of GMOs and glyphosate at GMOevidence.com . Or visit GMwatch.org or GMO.news to stay informed. California has recently announced its intention to add glyphosate to its list of 'known carcinogens,' and the World Health Organization recently declared glyphosate a 'probable carcinogen.' While the United States government openly colludes with Monsanto and the biotech industry to poison the American people with toxic GMOs and glyphosate, Russia apparently realizes that poisoning your own population is bad government .

0," The most savvy business person will tell you that they are always finding a better way to offer their product or otherwise make it more valuable, in order to increase sales and profits. But when that fails some companies, according to a recent lawsuit, resort to harder tactics - like extortion. A number of small businesses have filed suit against local business review start-up Yelp, Inc. , over allegations the latter's sales representatives offered to have negative reviews of businesses removed only if they bought advertising. According to The Wall Street Journal, the owner of Chicago's Bleeding Heart Bakery has alleged that Yelp 'offered in exchange for a paid sponsorship to push any bad reviews to the end of the bakery's listings on San Francisco-based Yelp's site.' The owner alleged further that a Yelp sales rep said they would personally remove reviews the owner thought were 'bogus,' according to the suit. 'Yelp's practices are extortionate and especially harmful to small businesses, such as our clients, who are particularly vulnerable to reviews posted on the site,' Jared H. Beck, co-managing partner of Beck & Lee, referring to the original plaintiff and nine new ones, told the paper. Not surprisingly, Yelp officials say the suit is bogus and without merit. 'The allegations stem from confusion over how our review filter works to protect consumers from fake reviews, and businesses from malicious reviews from competitors,' Vince Sollitto, Yelp's vice president of communications, told WSJ. But the complaints are not new. Last year, the East Bay Express newspaper ran a story describing similar allegations by businesses that Yelp sales reps were trying to help bad reviews in exchange for ad sales. According to that report, a Yelp rep offered to 'move' a local restaurateur's bad reviews 'for $299 a month.' Moreover, the restaurateur reported that the bad reviews of his business - which were, by far, the minority of reviews his restaurant received - even seemed seedy. 'When you do get a call from Yelp, and you go to the site, it looks like they have been moved,' the owner, John, said. 'You don't know if they happen to be at the top legitimately or if the rep moved them to the top. You don't even know if this is someone who legitimately doesn't like your restaurant. Almost all the time when they call you, the bad ones will be at the top.' In the end, it looks like the courts will decide whether or not Yelp's business model was taken from an old mafia playbook.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by breast-feeding, even if they have their first child later in life, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Los Angeles. Researchers analyzed data on women who had participated in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, the results of which were published in 2003. In the current study, researchers looked at the data for women over the age of 54, 995 of whom had breast cancer and 1,498 of whom did not. They compared the women's risk of acquiring breast cancer with their history of breastfeeding and their age at first birth. There are 200,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States every year, and it is the third most common cause of cancer death in the country. There are two main types of breast tumors: those that contain hormone receptors, and those that do not. Researchers have previously found that having a first child after the age of 25 increases a woman's chance of acquiring hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Among women who have their first child before the age of 25, those who have many children have an even lower breast cancer risk. In the current study, researchers found that breastfeeding decreased a woman's risk for both receptor-positive and receptor-negative cancers, regardless of the age at which she had her first child. 'As more women may choose to delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors,' said Giske Ursin, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.' 'Breastfeeding may have a protective effect that negates the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late pregnancies,' Ursin said. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Homemade shampoos can help speed hair growth. Hair loss is a natural part of aging, but healing herbs can restore healthy hair. Natural herbal shampoos allow herbs to be absorbed directly into the hair and the scalp, and encourage hair to grow. Homemade shampoos have the added advantage of preventing the application of damaging chemical agents that are added to many commercial shampoos, which cause damage to hair. Homemade Healthy Shampoos Homemade shampoos help restore hair growth and are inexpensive to make. Use a mild but cleansing soap base. Castile soap is a good option, as it is mild, but will effectively remove oils from the scalp and hair shaft. Keeping the scalp clean will encourage hair to grow. To stimulate hair growth, avoid any soap that has petroleum products as a base or lists chemicals on the label because these ingredients cause damage to the hair shaft and prevent hair growth. Chemicals to avoid include paraben, methylparaben, propylene glycol, cetearyl alcohol, propylparaben, glycol, Polyoxyethylene, or distearate. Herbs for Hair Growth: Essential Oils Numerous natural herbal remedies have been shown to stimulate the growth of hair. The best way to add these to a homemade shampoo is by adding either essential oils or herbal tinctures. To add essential oils, purchase alcohol free oils. Add one teaspoon to the soap base. Herbal Tinctures for Hair Growth Herbal tinctures can be made at home. The process is similar to making tea, but the tincture uses more tea and less water to create a concentrate. Add three teaspoons of herbs to six ounces of water. Allow the herbs to steep for 15 minutes and then strain out the herbs. Two ounces of the tincture can be added to four ounces of soap base. Nettles Grow Hair Nettles have been shown to stimulate the growth of hair . This native plant can be picked in the spring or summer and used fresh or dried. Out of season, herbal nettles can be purchased in the dried form. Either can be made into a tincture and added to the soap base. Rosemary Grows Hair Rosemary has been used as a hair tonic in folk medicine for centuries. It has a stimulating action on hair follicles. Because hair growth begins in the follicles, adding rosemary to a homemade shampoo will stimulate the growth and regrowth of hair. Rosemary blooms all summer long and can be picked and used fresh in a tincture, or dried for later use. Storing the Shampoo Glass is best for storing the homemade hair growth shampoo because the glass will not interact with the herbs. But for use in the shower, glass can break easily. A suggested solution is to store the shampoo in a glass jar; keep a small amount in a plastic bottle in the shower area and refresh weekly. Note: Refrigerate the herbal shampoo, as natural ingredients are not as stable as a commercial shampoo, and the homemade shampoo does not contain additives used to keep products stable at room temperature. http://www.selfnews.com/028251_hair_loss_... http://hubpages.com/hub/vitamins-for-hair-lo... http://www.holisticonline.com/Remedies/Hair/... http://www.selfnews.com/028050_vitamin_E_...

0," There's nothing quite like the double standard of the cognitively intolerant. In a mad scramble toward mindless social conformity, Amazon.com and other retailers have practically stampeded over each other to announce bans on sales of the Confederate flag . It has to be one of the most stupid, idiotic moments in U.S. corporate history... not merely because it is so slavishly desperate to appease the howling masses of hysterical thought police, but also because it's filled with extreme contradictions about what else Amazon happily sells from its website. 'Leading retailers including Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Sears (SHLD) and eBay (EBAY) have now said they'll stop selling Confederate flag merchandise,' reports Yahoo News . 'EBay announced its ban on Confederate flag sales a short while after that, saying 'we believe it has become a contemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism.' Amazon didn't respond for this article, but it announced its own ban about two hours after eBay did.' 'As the public outcry continues over the existence of the Confederate Flag, prominent online retailers Amazon and eBay announced Tuesday afternoon that they would ban merchandise that depicted the flag,' confirms Breitbart News , which also carries an article calling for the removal of the 'fascist, Anti-Christian Gay-Pride flag' from government buildings . The collapse of tolerance... and the rise of the dictatorial thought police The Confederate Flag, it seems, is 'highly inappropriate' according to all these retailers. The conflating of racism with the flag symbol is, of course, being driven into the minds of the public by the same mainstream media that once created mass hysteria over the total scientific hoax of arsenic in California wine (or the similar hysteria over measles at Disneyland). In a society where real tolerance has totally collapsed , the universal demand that's now pushed everywhere is one of absolute cognitive conformity . 'Thought obedience,' in other words, has become the new America, where even institutions of academia are so linguistically dumbed down that they're circulating memos warning staff members not to use 'politically incorrect' phrases like 'land of opportunity' or 'America is a melting pot.' To conform with the thought police, Amazon has hurriedly scrubbed its website of all Confederate flag listings. If you search Amazon.com for the Confederate flag, you might think you're finding a few items, but if you click on them, you discover Amazon.com has deleted the pages. What's next, is Amazon going to delete all its Dixie cups listings too? Will they yank Dukes of Hazzard, Season 1 because it depicts a gorgeous southern girl on the top of the General Lee car sporting a Confederate flag painted on its roof? How far will the Amazon thought police go to eliminate history, enforce popular revisionism and appease the howling hysterical masses? What does Amazon consider appropriate? Simulated rape tools for painfully gagging women and sexually abusing them In this society that has gone utterly insane with political correctness, you might wonder what, exactly, is still perfectly acceptable for companies like Amazon.com to sell online? How about extremely demeaning female bondage contraptions with names that includes wildly demeaning, racist terms like 'slave'? Amazon.com won't be selling you any Confederate flags, because that's highly offensive, but they'll gladly sell you the gear you might need to 'go masochist' on a girl you've hog-tied with a painful collection of gags, straps and restraints in the pursuit of simulated rape activities (see the Amazon.com images below for explicit examples). The very images of these products shown on Amazon.com depict women in distress, being tortured and gagged through the use of extremely painful mechanical restraints. All of these product photos shown below are taken directly from the Amazon.com and were readily searchable long after Amazon rapidly removed Confederate flag products from its website. What this means is that Amazon.com is now basing product listing decisions on waves of social hysteria rather than anything resembling thoughtful policy. Mark my words: There will be no public outcry against Amazon for selling abusive, 'simulated rape' tools like the ones shown here , all of which were found directly on the Amazon.com website. WARNING: GRAPHIC, DISTURBING AMAZON.COM IMAGES TO FOLLOW... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Yes, these are all products listed on Amazon.com as of June 23rd, 2015, the day Amazon.com banned the Confederate flag as being 'inappropriate.' Apparently, Amazon.com consider all these following product listings to be completely appropriate and acceptable to its customers. NOTE: We are NOT linking to these product pages because we don't wish to promote them. However, if you want to verify that they exist on Amazon.com, just search for them there, and you'll be able to confirm their listings. (Unless Amazon removes them after this article appears, of course...) Now please excuse me while I go vomit after sorting through these grotesque, demeaning images that Amazon.com promotes for PROFIT ... Somehow, at Amazon.com, this is all perfectly 'appropriate' stuff! But the Confederate flag is a 'symbol of hate' simply won't be tolerated. The way those colors of red, white and blue are arranged in a specific pattern is just too much, apparently. But serving up images of women being tortured, gagged, abused and enslaved? Oh, that's just the new normal in American psycho culture where there is no more objective reality and no moral standards of anything. Thanks to the howling hysteria of the left, whatever THEY want to say is wrong is widely and frantically condemned, while whatever they claim is right is universally celebrated even if it's totally insane. The only rule in America now is that you have to jump on every bandwagon of idiotic social conformity in order to avoid being shamed across social media. Which brings me to the whole solution for the Confederate flag: to be saved, the flag merely needs to publicly proclaim that it 'self-identified as a different flag altogether' and isn't really a Confederate flag at all. Amazon happy to sell Communist symbols celebrating the slaughter of 94 million people In addition to selling products with photos that depict the physical abuse of women, Amazon.com is also perfectly happy to sell communist merchandise celebrating the mass murder of 94 million people as carried out by various communist regimes. As this Breitbart.com article explains: Amazon sells a huge variety of shirts, posters, you-name-it featuring the hammer and sickle, Joseph Stalins mustache, all things Che Guevara, Vladimir Lenin and other colorful revolutionaries who fought to make the world a better place, man. Guevaras book Guerilla Warfare is on sale in four different formats. In one of the worst genocides in modern times, Stalin forcibly starved Ukrainian peasants in whats known as the Holodomor, a terror-famine that left anywhere from 2.4 million to 7.5 million Ukrainian peasants dead in 1933. Communism is chic: Amazons senior vice president Jay Carney proudly features Soviet Union war propaganda in his lavish home, after all. If you're Amazon.com, it's okay to promote images of mass murder and the extreme physical abuse of women with demeaning, violent images. That's all okay. But it's 'offensive' to sell the Confederate flag because someone somewhere might be 'offended.' So this is how Amazon.com devolves into a wussified, spineless reflection of the mindless masses. Whatever symbol is denounced by the political left will now be scrubbed by Amazon's own internal Ministry of Truth to immediately delete it from memory. With this surrender to popular hysteria, Amazon.com has truly devolved into Idiocracy . In Idiocracy, you may recall, the coffee chain Starbucks is where people go to get hand jobs. And the name of the Fuddruckers hamburger joint slowly morphed over time into 'Butt...' ... well, I can't quite print that here, it would be 'inappropriate.' The next rendition of Idiocracy will have to depict Amazon.com's totally idiotic response to the Confederate flag fiasco, where all items sold by the retailer have all signs, symbols and colors removed, devolving the site into a collection of 'blank' items that offend no one, such as blank paper, blank T-shirts and blank music CDs. I wonder if corporate America will ever come to its senses and realize you're not responsible for everyone else's emotions... If you wish, you can file a complaint with Amazon.com at this link . "
0," It's not just good for your physical health: regular exercise and physical fitness can dramatically improve your cognitive health as well. For example, a 2010 study published in the journal Brain Research found that physically fit 9- and 10-year-olds had significantly larger hippocampi (a region of the brain associated with memory and learning). In keeping with this finding, the same children also scored higher on memory tests than their less-fit peers. Likewise, in a 2008 research review published in the the Cochrane Library, researchers found that seniors who engaged in aerobic exercise between two and seven days per week scored significantly higher on tests of cognitive processing, visual and auditory attention, and even motor function than seniors who did not exercise comparably. It is increasingly becoming clear that the human body is designed for physical activity. When we neglect to use our bodies, it's not just our hearts and lungs that suffer; our brain suffers too, and our cognitive abilities along with it.

0," The same folks in North Carolina that tried to sue blogger Steve Cooksey simply for sharing information online about how to treat diabetes naturally are now going after all speech related to health and nutrition. The North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition (NCBDN) has launched an all-out assault against free speech with its antithetically named 'Modernize Dietetics/Nutrition Practice Act,' or House Bill 796, which would make it a crime to share health advice or food strategies with non-family members who are suffering from health conditions. The bill, which has already passed its first reading in the North Carolina State Senate, would prohibit unlicensed individuals from offering 'medical nutrition therapy,' which the proposed legislation defines as the 'provision of nutrition care services for the purpose of managing or treating a medical condition.' Recommending that a friend with an autistic child try the GAPS diet, for instance, would essentially be outlawed under HB 796, as only licensed dietitians would be permitted to dispense such nutrition advice. Or like with Steve Cooksey, teaching people how to overcome 'incurable' diseases through diet and supplementation would be off limits under HB 796. 'In essence, HB 796 will prevent anyone from communicating dietary advice to a non-family member who has a medical condition,' writes Robb Wolf, author of The Paleo Solution , on his blog. 'Friend of yours asks you how you lost weight? Can't say anything, as obesity is a 'medical condition.' Own a gym and want to do a Paleo Challenge? Good luck, the Dietetics Board of NC can, and likely will, sue you ... Since life itself can be labeled a 'medical condition' it provides a remarkably invasive reach for The North Carolina Board of Dietetics/Nutrition.' North Carolina obsessed with trying to control how people live It's rather unfortunate that North Carolina always seems to make the news for trying to pass draconian legislation to micromanage the lives of its residents. Everything from what North Carolinians eat ( raw milk is still illegal in North Carolina ) to how they take care of their health ( legislators recently tried to pass a bill even stricter than California's SB 277 that would have required everyone to be vaccinated ) seems to be a target of state authorities, who apparently despise individual liberty. In this case, NCBDN's attempt to restrict what North Carolinians say about food and medicine is completely over the top, and it's surprising (or perhaps not) that HB 796 has even made it as far as it has. But then again, this is a state the same country where remembering history through a flag is now considered evil while altering your gender and expecting free healthcare is now considered normal. 'There is a struggle emerging between the old guard of academia/medicine and the emergent, decentralized networks that provide arguably superior information,' adds Wolf, noting that the establishment healthcare paradigm is slowly crumbling, with bills like HB 796 representing a last-ditch effort at maintaining the corrupt status quo. 'Dietetics, as it is currently practiced, is an appalling failure. An auto mechanic who understands the rudiments of ancestral health is more valuable to our populace than 10,000 RDs who promulgate the same tired crap ... The old guard is getting crushed in a market-based sharing of information and their only response is to make a political/legal power-grab.' You can help fight against HB 796 by contacting Rules Chair Senator Tom Apodaca and urging him to stop this heinous bill from being released from the Rules Committee.

0," Superstorm Sandy has passed, causing billions of dollars in damage, flooding New York City, shuttering transportation systems and leaving over ten million people without power . While the storm may have passed, the danger of looting has only just begun. As the sun falls this evening, the combination of darkness, ongoing power outages, and emergency services operating in overload provides the perfect cover for looters and violent criminals to start attacking homes and businesses. As we previously reported , would-be looters are recruiting 'looting gangs' on Twitter, hoping others will join them in committing felony crimes while stealing computers, TVs and other valuables, presumably by shooting or attacking homeowners as part of the looting process. Looters obviously don't go outside in the middle of a hurricane, but now that the storm has passed, the real test of law and order begins tonight and may last for several nights. As long as the power grid is down, looters have a window of opportunity to break into homes and businesses and steal things. In many areas, the power grid will be down for an extended period of time. This is partially due to continued high winds, since power line crews can't even begin work on repairs until the wind calms. Another complicating factor is the severe flooding in many areas, which has inundated electrical equipment with water. Last night, Con Ed was forced to turned off the power to much of lower Manhattan, and when they turn that power back on, there's no question that all sorts of electronics are going to be shorted out and fried. Hundreds of transformers exploded across the region during the storm. That number may actually be in the thousands, as no official numbers are readily available. It will obviously take weeks to replace all these transformers. The National Guard has been activated and we may start to see Guard troops on the streets in some areas over the next few days, especially if looting begins to become a real problem. One thing that has emerged from the storm is that bicycles are currently the best form of transportation , allowing riders to navigate around stalled vehicles, fallen trees and random debris. If looters also decide to mount bicycles, they could become surprisingly mobile, evading police with relative ease. This is an important lesson for long-term survival strategies, by the way: Have a bicycle at the ready, because it's ultimately the most reliable form of transportation. Con Ed substation explodes This video shows a series of explosions at a Con Ed substation in New York City. It has been reported that this substation was destroyed by the explosions, and the rebuild time is a huge unknown right now. The homes and businesses served by this substation will obviously need to wait an extended period of time before power is restored. During the power outage, risk of looting and even vandalism is sharply heightened. According to local CBS news, restoring power to many customers will take 7 to 10 days . That also means there will be 7 to 10 nights for looters to exploit. While many customers will have power in the next 2-3 days, it will take much longer in some areas. Cell phone towers are also down in some areas, meaning that property owners have no way to call for help if they are targeted by criminals. 'This was a devastating storm, maybe the worst we have ever experienced,' said Mayor Bloomberg in a Tuesday press conference. '[Repairing] our power grid is going to take more time and require a lot of patience. Con Ed is describing the damage to its power system as unprecedented in scope.' The real test begins tonight As darkness falls tonight, we all need to keep a sharp watch on security in the areas hardest hit by superstorm Sandy. The big questions right now are: 1) How much looting activity will occur each night until the power is restored? 2) To what extent will local law enforcement and National Guard troops be able to prevent looting? 3) To what extent will property owners be able to defend their own property against looters and / or vandals? Here at selfnews, we of course hope that looting is minimized or even non-existent, but we also know that looting has been a component of nearly every major storm in recent memory. We have no reason to suspect that the aftermath of superstorm Sandy would be any different. In fact, it would be irrational to believe such a thing. We do know there will be many sleepless nights ahead as owners of businesses and homes work to protect themselves and their families from scumbag criminals who exploit disaster for their own personal gain. To aid in public safety, I have published a guide to tactical home defense that many homeowners may find useful. "
0," Mexico's Riviera Maya is an area of spectacular natural beauty along the Yucatan Peninsula and includes the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (also known as the Belize Barrier Reef) which starts near Cancun and continues along the whole length of the Riviera Maya, southward to Guatemala. Tourists and retirees have flocked to the area for snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, and guided jungle tours. What's more, the Mexican government has announced plans to establish several medium sized cities of about 200,000 inhabitants in the area over the next two decades. But there's a major problem. Researchers have discovered that prescription and street drugs, chemicals from shampoo and toothpaste, pesticides, chemical run-off from highways and many other pollutants have infiltrated the giant aquifer under the Riviera Maya. Bottom line: the water in the area is becoming poisoned. Aquifers are the saturated zone beneath the water table and they are huge storehouses of groundwater. Wells can be drilled into aquifers to pump out the water. But water coming from the crucial Riviera Maya aquifer is quickly turning toxic. Chemical waste has polluted an enormous labyrinth of water-filled caves under the area and the contaminated water flows out into the Caribbean Sea. Scientists fear this pollution along with over fishing, coral diseases, and possible climate change, has caused the loss of about half the corals on the reefs off the region's coast over the past 20 years. In a study just published in the journal Environmental Pollution , a research team including scientists from the Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), Northwestern University, Unidad Merida of Mexico and Canada's Trent University discovered drugs (illicit, prescription and over-the-counter) and chemicals from personal care products in the groundwater originated at four of the five locations from domestic sewage. In other words, people are flushing chemicals right into the groundwater. The major pollutants identified included cocaine and its major post-digestion 'metabolite' chemical (benzoylecgonine), triclosan (an anti-bacterial agent used in toothpaste, cleansers, and hand sanitizers), synthetic musks (used in perfumes and deodorants), acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) pollution discovered in the groundwater most likely came from runoff from highways, parking lots, airport tarmac, and other solid surfaces. Water samples drawn near a golf course were contaminated with pesticides, too. Currently, drinking water is being treated with reverse osmosis systems in the Riviera Maya. Unfortunately, the study concluded, '...this technology is unlikely to remove all micro-contaminants.' And while the levels of pollution found are not considered a health threat today, the study authors noted: 'The data provided in this study raise some concerns about the potential for human exposure from the consumption of contaminated drinking water... As well, prevention and mitigation measures are needed to ensure that expanding development does not damage the marine environment and human health and, in turn, the region's tourism-based economy.' The researchers' recommendations for dealing with the critical water contamination issues in the Rivera Maya include having impermeable liners installed beneath golf courses and other areas that are extensively covered with turf to restrict the leaching of contaminants, adequate wastewater treatment infrastructure, a halt to injections of treated sewage into saltwater below the freshwater aquifer, and measures to avoid aquifer contamination from hard surface runoff.

0," For far too long, breakfast cereal makers have carried out highly deceptive product labeling and positioning campaigns through the use of the term 'natural.' Consumers are easily misled by this term, believing it to mean the product is free from pesticide chemicals and genetically engineered ingredients. But an explosive new investigation by the Cornucopia Institute ( www.Cornucopia.org ) -- the same group that exposed the widespread use of hexane solvents in soy protein -- is set to send shockwaves through the 'natural' products industry by revealing which so-called 'natural' brands actually contain high levels GMOs and toxic chemical pesticides. selfnews is helping the Cornucopia Institute break this story with exclusive articles and email alerts going out to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This story is being shared on Facebook and Twitter, and on the selfnews Radio Network ( www.selfnewsRadio.com ). This story will also be covered this Thursday on the Alex Jones Show ( www.InfoWars.com ), when a representative from the Cornucopia Institute will be interviewed on live national radio. You can help spread the word about this important story by sharing this article . Three facts you need to know about GMOs before you read the explosive test results below Before you view the Cornucopia's test results below, there are three important things you need to know about GMOs: #1) There is GE contamination in almost everything . Even 'non-GMO' food products almost always contain trace levels of GMOs (often between .01% and 0.5%). A test for the mere presence of GMOs is not considered conclusive. What's important is the level of GMOs in a particular food item. Some of the 'natural' items tested by the Cornucopia Institute showed GMO contamination levels between 28 and 100 %, which means the key ingredients in those cereals are most definitely genetically engineered from the source (and it's not just a chance contamination from some other nearby field). #2) All GMO tests are merely a 'snapshot' that can change over time . Foods that test free of GMOs today may contain higher levels tomorrow due to supply line errors, contamination, supply source changes, and so on. At the same time, foods that test at high levels of GMOs today may test at lower levels in the future or even for different batches from the same manufacturer. Sometimes manufacturers are lied to by their suppliers. Some manufacturers test for GMOs in every batch, but others take a 'don't ask don't tell' approach where they don't test because they'd rather not know. #3) Products may be 'enrolled' in the Non-GMO Project and still contain GMOs before they are 'verified.' The Non-GMO Project has two designations for products. There are products which are 'enrolled' which means they are 'on the path' to becoming free of GMOs but may not have achieved it yet. Thus, it is true that products 'enrolled' in the Non-GMO Project may still contain substantial levels of GMOs. Products that meet far more stringent supply line audits and GE testing requirements are granted the label 'Verified' by the Non-GMO Project. You got all that? It's a lot to keep in mind. GMOs are a complicated issue. But one thing is certain: Most 'natural' breakfast cereals contain surprisingly high levels of genetically engineered ingredients. This is why it's crucial to shop for certified organic breakfast cereals from companies like Nature's Path, whose products are 100% certified organic and free from GMOs. All these concerns about GMOs don't even cover residues of toxic and carcinogenic pesticides in the grains used to produce ' natural ' breakfast cereals. The Cornucopia report cites extensive USDA testing and research revealing which 'natural' grains and ingredients may be routinely contaminated with chemical pesticides. Synthetic pesticides are banned in organic production with oversight by independent certifiers and USDA accreditation, so organic is once again the way to go if you wish to avoid pesticide residues. Keep reading to see some of the shocking test results uncovered by the Cornucopia Institute... Here's what the test results reveal The Cornucopia Institute's 'Cereal Scorecard' ( http://www.cornucopia.org/2011/10/natural-vs... ) reveals some truly astonishing facts about what's in our breakfast cereal: Kashi brand cereals (Kellogg's) contains 'high levels' of GMOs. Not just a trace of GMOs, in other words, but a high level meaning the key ingredients are genetically engineered from the get-go. In fact, selfnews has learned that test results reveal 100% of the soy used in tested boxes of Kashi cereal was genetically engineered soy. Mother's brand cereals (PepsiCo) contains 'high levels' of GMOs. Test results revealed 28% of the corn to be genetically engineered. Whole Foods' 365 brand Corn Flakes contains 'high levels' of GMOs (more than 50% GE corn). Barbara's Bakery Puffins cereal was also shown to contain more than 50% genetically engineered corn. Both Barbaras Bakery Puffins and Whole Foods 365 Corn Flakes are 'enrolled' in the Non-GMO Project, says Cornucopia (see below). Note that this does not mean 'verified' by the Non-GMO Project, which is a different designation. Still, the term 'enrolled' in the Non-GMO Project may imply to many shoppers that the products are free from GMOs. This is something selfnews will address later, as it is a concern for both us and many readers who have long believed that any affiliation with the Non-GMO Project meant the same thing as 'GMO free,' which it does not. One of the shining examples honest organic cereal is Nature's Path , whose products are all certified organic, contained no significant GMO contamination and are clearly made with entirely non-GMO ingredients. As the report states: Numerous natural products were indeed contaminated with high levels of GE ingredients, sometimes as high as 100%: Kashi GoLean, Mothers Bumpers, Nutritious Living Hi-Lo, and General Mills Kix. Kashi Heart to Heart Blueberry cereal costs more than Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Cinnamon Optimum Cereal, and yet the grains used in Kashi cereal were found by the USDA, to typically contain residues of all the following pesticide chemicals: phosmet, carbaryl, azinphos methyl, malathion, chlorpyrifos methyl, chlorpyrifos . (Note: This does not mean these Kashi cereals were tested for each of these chemicals, only that these chemicals are admitted by the USDA to be found in the non-organic grains used to manufacture Kashi cereals.) Quaker Oats states that it is an 'all-natural' product. But Quaker Oats (a unit of PepsiCo) manages a processing plant that emits roughly 19,000 pounds of sulfuryl fluoride yearly. Sulfuryl fluoride is a toxic greenhouse gas used to treat crops like oats in storage. 'Natural' Peace Cereal Wild Berry Crisp is produced from conventional commodity ingredients commonly containing the neurotoxin phosmet and the carcinogen captan in 11% and 55% of samples, respectively. Mom's Best Naturals Raisin Bran cereal contains 'natural' (non-GMO) ingredients that are commonly contaminated with malathion and phosmet chemicals, both of which are neurotoxins. Several Bear Naked and Kashi products contain conventional soy protein. Soy protein in this country is nearly universally hexane-extracted. The 'hexane bath' that the soybeans are immersed in consists of more than 50% n-hexane, which is a known neurotoxin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

0," Although it's still summer in North America, it is of course winter in Australia, and the flu season is well under way there. As usual, Australian health authorities have been urging parents there to vaccinate their children against the flu, propagating the mythology that flu vaccines are both safe and effective. But this time around, many Australian parents found out the hard way that they were being lied to . It didn't take long to realize the truth after their children start going into convulsions following the flu vaccine injections. Other children began vomiting or exhibiting dangerously high levels of fever. One child has gone into a coma and may never recover. As reported in WA Today ( http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/flu-vaccin... ) 'Perth mother of two Bea Flint said her 11-month-old boy Avery had a seizure after receiving the first dose of the two-dose flu vaccination on Saturday. Mrs Flint said that after the 9am vaccination she noticed Avery had a minor temperature about 2pm. At 7.45pm, Avery started whimpering and moaning. When Mrs Flint got to his cot the baby had vomited and was lying on his side having a seizure. 'He couldn't cry - his head was hanging down in the car seat and he couldn't move. I was petrified - it was one of the worst experiences of my life.' The story goes on to say, 'The doctor who treated Avery told Mrs Flint her baby was the fifth child with similar symptoms admitted to the hospital that day.' In other words, this was no rare event. Vaccinated children suffering severe convulsions were piling up in hospital emergency rooms across the country. The real kicker, though, is that children started having convulsions two weeks ago but Australian health authorities ignored them, insisting that the vaccine was safe and causing it to be injected in yet more babies. Two weeks later, with dozens more children experiencing convulsions (and who knows how many thousands actually being harmed in less obvious ways), Commonwealth chief health officer Professor Jim Bishop finally announced the vaccination ban. Remember: Health authorities in Australia , UK, the United States and everywhere else have relentlessly insisted that flu vaccines are perfectly safe and can't possibly harm anyone. In the U.S., the FDA has given its approval to the very same flu vaccine that's harming children in Australia , and the CDC has insisted that all children in the USA -- regardless of age -- should now be injected with this very same flu vaccine. So now we've got a vaccine that Australia has banned but the USA somehow says is safe enough to inject into a six-month-old infant. How many convulsing babies will it take in the U.S. before American parents realize the truth about flu vaccines? Chemically induced convulsions As you're reading this, you may find yourself wonder, 'Well, what could cause such convulsions in children?' The answer is more terrifying than you might think, because it's not 'weakened flu viruses' that vaccine manufacturer claim they put into the vaccines . A weakened flu virus doesn't send children into convulsions. Only a chemical can do that . The chemical in question is one that's routinely added to most vaccines as a way to aggravate the immune system to respond to the presence of the weakened virus. It's called an 'adjuvant' and consists of a highly inflammatory chemical that we now know may damage brain tissues and the nervous system. It is this adjuvant that most likely caused the convulsions in children. Even in children who don't experience convulsions, there is speculation that this adjuvant may lead to future Alzheimer's disease or other neurological disorders. Vaccine manufacturers always attempt to downplay their use of adjuvant chemicals, and few media outlets focus on this important point, but it is the adjuvant that is most likely responsible for sending these Australian children into hospitals with convulsions. Health authorities defend dangerous vaccine One thing I've noticed about vaccine pushers is that they behave like irrational zealots. No matter how much evidence surfaces about the dangers of vaccines, they continue to mindlessly push them while ignoring the evidence. A pediatric professor in Australia, Dr Peter Richmond, admitted that researchers were trying to figure out if the entire vaccine was dangerous, or if there was just a bad batch. But even before getting the answer to this question, he goes on to say that everybody over the age of five should go ahead and get injected with this same vaccine! ( http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/flu-vaccin... ) In other words, he's so convinced the vaccine is safe -- even after dozens of children were obviously harmed by it -- that he's still pushing the same dangerous vaccine onto everybody else! This is precisely the kind of attitude reflected across the vaccine industry. Reports of children being harmed, or paralyzed, or hospitalized by vaccines are always written off as 'coincidence.' The mounting evidence is simply thrown out the window because it conflicts with the pro-vaccine agenda. Can you imagine the outrage if an herbal product sent fifty kids to the hospital suffering from convulsions? Health authorities across the world would be quick to condemn the product, and they'd confiscate it right off the shelves while shutting down the operations of its manufacturer. But somehow when a vaccine does the same thing, these same health authorities urge people to keep on injecting their children with it! It makes no sense. But then again, the vaccine industry was never based on rational thinking in the first place. If health authorities were truly rational, they'd be handing out vitamin D supplements to children instead of injecting them with vaccines, because vitamin D has been scientifically proven to provide better protection against the flu than vaccines. ( http://www.selfnews.com/029333_vitamin_D_... ) Of course, to ask health authorities to make rational decisions is sort of like asking politicians to start telling the truth. In the complicated world of profits and politics, rational, honest thinking just doesn't get any traction. It's far more profitable to keep lying to the world and raking in billions of dollars each year off dangerous vaccines, even as they continue to harm innocent children. I often wonder... How many dead children will it take before parents wake up and realize that flu vaccines are dangerous? The answer may surprise you: Even a million dead children won't change the minds of most parents because they just do whatever they're told by health authorities, even if it makes no rational sense. Most parents are so brainwashed by the medical system that they would gladly line up to have their babies injected with chemotherapy if they were told it was somehow necessary. At some point, the parents whose babies are being harmed or potentially even killed by these vaccines can only blame themselves. They were the ones who brought their babies to be injected with a chemical adjuvant and viral fragments, and they should know better than to trust the government when it comes to health advice. The government, after all, still says that pharmaceutical chemicals are good for you while vitamins, herbs and natural remedies are dangerous. And it's the government that approved the very vaccines that are right now sending these children to the hospital. Any parent that trusts the government with the health of their child is setting themselves up for catastrophe. And that catastrophe could very well cost them the life of their child.

0," Newly-released documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) reveal that the US Depart of Homeland Security has been working on plans to roll out a new wave of mobile surveillance technologies at train stations, stadiums and streets. These new technologies will track your eye movements, capture and record your facial dimensions for face-recognition processing, bathe you in X-rays to look under your clothes, and even image your naked body using whole-body infrared images that were banned from consumer video cameras because they allowed the camera owners to take 'nude' videos of people at the beach. Most importantly, many of these technologies are designed to be completely hidden, allowing the government to implement 'covert inspection of moving subjects.' You could be walking down a hallway at a sports stadium, in other words, never knowing that you're being bathed in X-rays from the Department of Homeland Security, whose operators are covertly looking under your clothes to see if you're carrying any weapons. Roving vans to 'track eye movements' According to a Forbes.com article ( http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/0... ), one project pursued by DHS using technology from Siemens would 'mount backscatter x-ray scanners and video cameras on roving vans, along with other cameras on buildings and utility poles, to monitor groups of pedestrians, assess what they carried, and even track their eye movements.' Another project involved developing 'a system of long range x-ray scanning to determine what metal objects an individual might have on his or her body at distances up to thirty feet.' We already know that the U.S. government has purchased 500 vans using covert backscatter technology to covertly scan people on the streets ( http://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/0... ). They're called 'Z Backscatter Vans, or ZBVs.' This is all part of the U.S. government's new wave of police state surveillance that aims to track and irradiate innocent civilians who have committed no crime. Under the new Janet Napolitano regime, all Americans are now considered potential terrorists , and anyone can be subjected to government-sanctioned radiation scanning at any time, without their knowledge or approval. And don't think these efforts will be limited merely to backscatter technology: The TSA is now testing full-power, deep-penetrating X-ray machines (like the ones that deliver chest X-rays in hospitals) in order to check people for bombs they may have swallowed. Yes, Janet Napolitano now wants to look inside your colon ! And they're willing to X-ray everyone -- without their consent -- in order to do that. Read the documents yourself If you have trouble believing the U.S. government is unleashing a new wave of police state covert scanning vans on to the streets of America, you can read the documents yourself -- all 173 pages. They're available on the EPIC website at: http://epic.org/privacy/body_scanners/EPIC_B... EPIC calls these vans 'mobile strip search devices' because they give the federal government technology to look under your clothes without your permission or consent. It's also being done without probable cause , so it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment protections that are guaranteed to Americans under the Bill of Rights. 'It's a clear violation of the fourth amendment that's very invasive, not necessarily effective, and poses all the same radiation risks as the airport scans,' said EPIC attorney Ginger McCall, in the Forbes article (above). Huge health risks to the population It's not just the privacy issues that raise red flags here, of course: It's also the fact that the U.S. government has no respect whatsoever for the health of its citizens who are being subjected to these radiation emitting devices. Even while the TSA refuses to release testing results from its own naked body scanners, DHS keeps buying more machines (and more powerful machines) that will only subject travelers to yet more radiation. As we've already reported here on selfnews.com, numerous scientists are already on the record warning that the TSA's backscatter 'naked body scanners' could cause breast cancer, sperm mutation and other health problems ( http://www.selfnews.com/030607_naked_body... ). But the U.S. government doesn't seem to care what happens to your health. Their position is that their 'right' to know what you're carrying under your clothes or inside your body overrides your right to privacy or personal health. All they have to do is float a couple of fabricated terrorism scare stories every few months, and then use those 'threats' as justification for violating the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens are very turn. The real question in all this, of course, is how far will this go? The TSA is already reaching down your pants and feeling up peoples' genitals as part of the 'security' measures. Will DHS soon just start subjecting people to body cavity searches as a necessary security requirement before entering a football stadium, for example? Will Americans now be X-rayed with cancer-causing ionizing radiation -- without their awareness or consent -- merely because they are walking down the street or boarding a train? That seems to be the case. And as you can readily tell from all this, it's getting harder and harder for the fast-dwindling group of deniers to claim America isn't already a police state . The USA is fast becoming a high-tech version of the very worst police state tyrannies witnessed throughout human history. The only difference is that now they have 'science' on their side with the coolest new technology that can violate your rights and irradiate your body in a hundred different ways, with high-resolution images and digital storage devices. I suppose if all this were being done to really stop international terrorists, that might be one thing. But what has become increasingly clear in observing the government's behavior in this realm is that the U.S. government now considers Americans to be the enemy -- especially those who have the gall to defend their Constitutionally-protected freedoms or question the unjustified centralization of power taking place right now in Washington. The DHS is America's new secret police. And their cameras are pointing inward , into the everyday lives of Americans; not outward , aimed at international terrorists. When the price of security becomes forfeiting your liberty , the source of the 'terror' is no longer the terrorists but your own government . Isn't this the lesson that history has taught us well? Watch the talk by Naomi Wolf, who explains all this extremely well: Part 1: http://selfnews.tv/v.asp?v=EEE6C7A46FA0A5... Part 2: http://selfnews.tv/v.asp?v=176F565D8E528E...

0," In a desperate bid to bring customers back through their doors, Taco Bell has mapped out a plan to start serving alcohol at new urban locations. Taco Bell plans to sell anything from beer and wine to 'mixed alcohol freezes.' The first Taco Bell bar design will be featured at a select location in Chicago this summer and will take an entirely new approach to fast food. The new restaurant design has already been launched in South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. The fast food chain, owned by Yum Brands Inc., is desperately trying to court millennials who have fallen out of love with the brand's cheap fast food image. Marketers believe more millennials now prefer restaurants that are more authentic and less run-of-the-mill like Taco Bell. Trying to shed their cheap, cookie cutter image, the new urban Taco Bell will feature a row of lime green stools and a bar that faces the kitchen and a brick wall where local artists can showcase their creativity. The new marketing plan will feature the work of local artists to bring back a familiar, neighborhood feel. The first Taco Bell to sell alcohol and feature local artwork will be the location in the Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago. Corporate Taco Bell headquarters has no plans to turn their other franchises across the country into bars, but they do have plans to take out some controversial additives from their food offerings. In a rush to bring back business, Taco Bell has recently announced their plan to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from their food , including added trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. While it's a step in the right direction, Taco Bell food is far from healthy. You pretty much have to be intoxicated to eat Taco Bell food in the first place No matter how it's redesigned, Taco Bell represents the bowels of American fast food. Pig out on this food over the weekend and come Monday morning your bowels might not be working so well as you writhe in pain on the toilet. There's hardly any nutrition in these empty-calorie foodstuffs. On top of that, no one really knows if their taco meat is real at all. If it is, were the cows raised on GMO grains, antibiotics and growth-stimulant drugs? Some people might be able to stomach this kind of food once a year, but someone who eats Taco Bell once or twice a week would have to be intoxicated with some kind of substance in order to claim this food as acceptable for their stomach. What the menu has to offer is nothing close to real food, let alone authentic Mexican food. Maybe this is why Taco Bell is experimenting with selling beer. If their customers would just loosen up, then they might stay a while and consider buying a few more bean burritos. By the way, bean burritos are one of the simplest foods to make. Why did Taco Bell turn a simple bean burrito into a complicated nightmare of ingredients? Take a look at the ingredient list for a Taco Bell bean burrito... First there are the pinto beans and the seasoning blend, which should be all that's in it, but there's also soy oil which includes shortening with TBHQ and citric acid to protect the flavor. The burrito filling also includes autolyzed yeast extract, sunflower oil, maltodextrin, inactivated yeast, corn flour, sugar, 'natural flavors,' trehalose, (genetically) modified corn starch and silicone dioxide for processing. With this onerous list of ingredients in the bean burrito filling alone, it's no wonder Taco Bell is pledging to take some additives out to make customers feel better. Adding alcohol to the menu might help customers accept the food again too, as the Taco Bell brand tries to bring back that good feeling that has been lost ever since customers started figuring out that this kind of food was making them sicker and more putrid than ever before.

0," In a refreshing change of pace, an established doctor has shed light on the fact that many mainstream medical approaches designed to improve health aren't what they're cracked up to be. In fact, they're downright ineffective. While this hardly comes as a surprise when you consider the plethora of side effects that come with pharmaceuticals, and that they alter the minds of those who take them, what is surprising is that a medical professional has boldly dared to come forward to publicly expose a medical scam. Dr. Dwight Lundell, a heart surgeon and retired Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at Banner Heart Hospital in Mesa, Arizona, has made no qualms about pharmaceuticals' ineffectiveness and the need to let go of commonly held medical beliefs. In particular, he's put statins in the spotlight, saying that the cholesterol-lowering drugs wreak havoc on health. (1) Heart surgeon: Current heart health methods and recommendations 'not working' His comment deserves reading: As a heart surgeon with 25 years experience... today is my day to right the wrong with medical and scientific fact. I trained for many years with other prominent physicians labeled 'opinion makers.' Bombarded with scientific literature, continually attending education seminars, we opinion makers insisted heart disease resulted from the simple fact of elevated blood cholesterol. The only accepted therapy was prescribing medications to lower cholesterol and a diet that severely restricted fat intake. The latter of course we insisted would lower cholesterol and heart disease. Deviations from these recommendations were considered heresy and could quite possibly result in malpractice. It Is Not Working! These recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible. (1) His thought-provoking statements reinforce what many have believed all along: The conventional medical system is not working. Yet ties to deep pockets and behind-the-scenes ulterior business motives which are common in the mainstream medical world keep the industry going. The business of sickness is a profitable one. For example, statin drugs recently came under even more scrutiny than normal after scientists at Tulane University in New Orleans produced more evidence that they are far from healthy. It was determined that they accelerate the aging process, render many of the body's cells unable to carry out essential functions and can lead to liver dysfunction, memory loss, cataracts and diabetes. (2) Lying for profit: Telling healthy people they are anything but Heart health and the pharmaceutical inadequacies surrounding it aren't the only medical issues coming under fire. When it comes to cancer, chemotherapy-for-profit scams abound. Sadly, there are many bad apples in the medical bunch who think it's acceptable to tell healthy people that they have cancer when they don't, even going so far as to administer treatments. One such doctor is Michigan oncologist Dr. Farid Fata, who pleaded guilty to 16 counts of healthcare fraud and misdiagnosing patients. He repeatedly misinformed patients that they needed chemotherapy when they did not. Some family members of his patients even noted a sense of desperation; one son recalls the time his father was met by Dr. Fata's staff curbside, at which point they proceeded to give his deteriorating father treatments as he sat in his car in a parking garage. (3) Not so pretty in pink: Cancer scams also a disgrace The cancer scams have long-been a disgrace to society, with the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation at the forefront of such deceit and wrongdoing. As reported by alternative media sites , their partnerships with mammogram manufacturers and pharma companies mean guess what it's not really your health, but the financial partnerships they've forged, that truly matter. All of that, tied up in a neat little pink bow and perhaps a matching pink shirt to match, to make you feel good about donating to a cause. (4) Then there's the whole debacle with mammograms. While women flock to them in droves based on the ingrained (brainwashed?) belief that they're life-saving devices, the reality is that many times the method fails to properly differentiate between invasive and non-invasive cancers. As such, many women undergo energy-zapping, drawn-out procedures that forever alter their health, or even lead to their death. (5) So, kudos to Dr. Dwight Lundell for speaking up. Everyone deserves good health, not false promises and scams that create the opposite effect. "
0," Tweet A chemical called triclosan poses a health risk, as it is a toxic compound which can promote cancer. The most shocking thing is that triclosan is commonly found in everyday consumer goods such as antibacterial soaps, deodorants, body washes, creams, lotions, cosmetics, cleaning supplies, detergents, dishwashing liquids, and yes, mouthwash and toothpaste. Toothpaste is supposed to help clean your teeth, but what it actually does just might horrify you. When tap water meets toothpaste, the triclosan reacts freely with the chlorine in the tap water to become chloroform (a chlorinated aromatic) and is similar to the dioxins found in the compound Agent Orange. It's a chemical reaction occurring right in your mouth while you brush your teeth. And don't think you are safe once you rinse it all out of your mouth: research shows that it can remain in your mouth after brushing for up to 12 hours, and can be easily absorbed into the tongue and through mucus into the body. (Children are at the greatest risk, as they tend to swallow their toothpaste more while brushing their teeth.) According to the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides (NCAMP), 'Manufacturers of a number of triclosan-containing toothpaste and soap products claim that the active ingredient continues to work for as long as 12 hours after use. Thus, consumers are exposed to triclosan for much longer than the 20 seconds it takes to wash their hands or brush their teeth.' 'These products produce low levels of chloroform, but that adds up over time. The amount of gas formed is very low but I think the key thing is that we just don't know what the effects are. However, manufacturers do have to list triclosan on their ingredients, so if consumers are worried the best advice is to avoid products with the chemical,' said Giles Watson, a toxicology expert. Triclosan is officially a probably human carcinogen The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Union currently regulate triclosan, and the Environmental Protection Agency classifies this substance as a probable human carcinogen. Toothpaste manufacturers claim that triclosan is used because it helps to reduce plaque and kill bacteria, but it actually aids in gum damage and can cause mouth ulcers, say some health experts. These companies like the chemical because it allows them to state the product is a '99.9% bacteria killer' and make claims about the product being a 'medicated formula.' According to the chemical creator's website, Ciba Specialty Chemicals 'invented triclosan more than 35 years ago and in this long time of application without any adverse effects it has proven itself as the 'aspirin' of the antibacterial actives -- helpful without side effects. 'The popularity of triclosan is a reflection of its unique combination of efficacy against almost all types of bacteria and safety to man and nature which with the currently known substances used cannot be surmounted.' The toothpaste manufacturers haven't done any substantial studies that reach a decision on whether to take triclosan out of their products. They continue to say that it is safe and only harmful if ingested. Even then, they say it only affects the nervous system (as if that's something very minor to have harmed). No good science supporting safety of triclosan According to the American Medical Association: 'Despite their recent proliferation in consumer products, the use of antimicrobial agents such as triclosan in consumer products has not been studied extensively. No data exist to support their efficacy when used in such products or any need for themit may be prudent to avoid the use of antimicrobial agents in consumer products.' The chemical company states: 'Ciba supports the use of triclosan only if there is a benefit to human beings.' So, what if it is shown to offer no benefit to humans? Will they pull it off the shelves now that evidence points to its danger from exposure? (Some toothpaste manufacturers, like Tom's of Maine, specifically state that they do not contain triclosan.) Also found in toys, bedding, clothing and more Triclosan is also used in plastics and fabrics, where it goes under the trade names Microban and Biofresh respectively. It is infused into or used as an additive in a number of consumer products like toys, bedding, trash bags, socks, kitchen utensils, textiles and plastics. 'Over 95% of the uses of triclosan are in consumer products that are disposed of in residential drains. In a U.S. Geological Survey study of 95 different organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams, triclosan was one of the most frequently detected compounds, and in some of the highest concentrations,' according to the NCAMP. According to Worldwatch Institute: 'In the United States, 75% of liquid soaps and nearly 30% of bar soaps now contain triclosan and other germ-fighting compounds whose prevalence can foster the growth of bacterial resistance.' The widespread use of triclosan is now known to create the risk of breeding new, resistant superbugs that may be far more dangerous to human health than the original germs killed by triclosan in the first place. My advice to consumers is to avoid all products containing triclosan . Action items Avoid all products that make 'antibacterial' claims (unless they are using herbs to accomplish it). Be aware of the harmful environmental impact of consuming products containing triclosan. The ingredient is not only unhealthy for humans, it's also unhealthy for the environment. Read the ingredients labels of all consumer products in order to make sure they do not contain triclosan. "
0," Three Namibian women have filed a lawsuit against the country's government, claiming they were sterilized at state-run hospitals without their informed consent after being diagnosed with HIV. 'HIV-positive women are holding the health system accountable for the wrongs done to them,' said Veronica Kalambi of the Women's Health Network. The plaintiffs are represented by the Legal Assistance Center, which says it has collected evidence of 15 such forced sterilizations since 2008. The three women are seeking one million Namibian dollars (U.S. $130,000) in damages. 'We want a health system based on human rights which promotes equality for all,' said Amon Ngavetene of the Legal Assistance Center. According to Ngavetene, women in Namibia who are diagnosed with HIV are often urged by their doctors to undergo sterilization operations. The women are not always given a clear explanation of the risks and consequences of the procedure, nor of the alternatives available (such as drugs) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. In addition, doctors do not always take into account pre-existing conditions that might make the sterilization more dangerous. All these problems are exacerbated by communication barriers in a country with 11 indigenous languages. Hundreds of people marched in support of the women in the Namibian capital of Windhoek, as well as in South Africa, Zambia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Supporters also held sit-ins at two of the hospitals accused of performing the procedures. According to protest organizer Vicky Noa, women deserve 'peace of mind that if you have HIV you can still go to the hospital and be treated with dignity and equality.' 'If we were scared that we might be sterilized, we will not use the hospital services as much,' she said. 'We do not want to be denied the right to motherhood.' According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, one in five Namibians, or 200,000 people, have been diagnosed as HIV positive.

0," Great white sharks, formerly thought to have a maximum lifespan of about 20 years, can actually live as long as human beings, according to a new study that may have serious implications for ocean conservation. The study was led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and published in the journal PLOS ONE . 'White sharks in the northwest Atlantic are considerably older than previous age estimates,' researcher Li Ling Hamady said. Great white sharks are among the ocean's top predators. Although they are most common in temperate and subtropical waters, they migrate over vast distances and can be found in almost any part of the ocean. Nuclear tests provide key The most common method for estimating age in fish involves counting layers of mineralized tissue in certain body parts that grow consistently throughout the animal's life. Much like tree rings, the number of bands present can indicate an animal's age. Previous studies, assuming that shark growth bands are deposited annually, have pegged the oldest great white sharks at 22 and 23 years of age, identified in the southwestern Pacific and western Indian oceans, respectively. But the assumption that growth bands are deposited annually - or even that their rate of deposition is consistent throughout life - has remained untested. In addition, the banding patterns in great white sharks tend to be narrower and less distinct than in other species, making them more difficult to count. 'Traditionally, ageing sharks has relied on the assumption that band pairs are annual. In many cases this has been proven correct for part or all of a species life, however in more and more cases this is being disproven,' said researcher Lisa Natanson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science Center lab in Narragansett, R.I. For the new study , researchers took advantage of the fact that nuclear testing during the 1950s and 1960s flooded the oceans with radioactive carbon, or carbon-14. Because carbon-14 degenerates into non-radioactive carbon at a consistent rate, the researchers were able to use carbon-14 concentrations to date the different tissue layers in the vertebrae of four male and four female great white sharks caught in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean between 1967 and 2010. The study showed that the oldest of the four females was 40 years old, while the oldest male was 73. If a lifespan of 70 years or more is typical, that would make great white sharks among longest lived of all cartilaginous fishes. The study also confirmed that, while growth bands are indeed laid down annually in small to medium-large great white sharks, the rate of band deposition may change later in life. In addition, many bands become so thin that they are effectively uncountable. 'This research demonstrates the power of applying cutting-edge techniques in isotope geochemistry to answer fundamental questions in ocean ecology,' researcher Simon Thorrold said. 'The radiocarbon time stamp in white shark vertebrae provides irrefutable evidence of white shark longevity that had proved to be impossible to verify using traditional age estimation methods.' Conservation implications The study also shows that great white sharks grow and mature much more slowly than had previously been thought. This implies that the species is even more vulnerable to overfishing, habitat degradation and other extinction risks than had been previously thought. 'These findings change the way we model white shark populations and must be taken into consideration when formulating future conservation strategies,' researcher Greg Skomal said. 'Understanding longevity of the species, growth rate, age at sexual maturity, and differences in growth between males and females are especially important for sustainable management and conservation efforts,' Hamady said.

0," It is one of the only major food crops left without a genetically-modified (GM) counterpart, but this could soon change if the Australian government gets its way in approving a GM wheat variety developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), an agency of the Australian government. Despite being hailed by its creators as a breakthrough in food production technology, the GM wheat crop itself, when ingested, has the potential to permanently alter the human genome by silencing hundreds of genes throughout the body. This disturbing fact, of course, makes GM wheat a major public health threat, which is why a number of scientific experts are urging extreme caution with the human trial and commercial approval process. During a recent press conference with Safe Food Foundation Director Scott Kinnear, two prominent authorities on the subject discussed the inherent dangers of GM wheat, and how the 'Frankencrop' threatens to seriously injure and even kill untold numbers of people who could experience dramatic genetic alterations as a result of consumption. 'What we found is that the molecules created in this wheat, intended to silence wheat genes, can match human genes,' explains Professor Jack Heinemann, a Molecular Biologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, about the dangers of CSIRO's untested GM wheat. 'And through ingestion, these molecules can enter human beings and potentially silence our genes.' Heinemann goes on to explain that he and his team have already identified more than 770 pages' worth of potential matches between two specific genes in the GM wheat and genes inherent in the human genome that could be altered by them. Beyond this, more than a dozen matches were found to be identical and 'sufficient to cause silencing in experimental systems,' according to Heinemann. You can watch the complete press release here: http://youtu.be/FI7n_caiTvE GM wheat can pass genetic flaws from generation to generation The immediate threats of consuming GM wheat are quite substantial, in other words, and illustrate the enormous consequences that can result from tampering with nature at the genetic level. But even worse are the generational consequences that can result from consuming GMOs in general, and specifically the GM wheat in question. 'If this genetic modification in the wheat is absorbed into the human body and affects humans in the same way that it affects the wheat, then it'll mean that there will be some significant changes in the way that we store our carbohydrate, our glucose, in the body, and that could have dire consequences,' adds Prof. Judy Carman, a biochemist and Director of the Institute of Health and Environmental Research (IHER) at Flinders University in Australia. 'We need to make what's called glycogen in the body in order to be able to live, in order to be able to wake up in the morning after an overnight fast and to be able to have a burst of energy to run across a road. And if this silences the same sort of gene in us as it silences in the wheat, then children who are born with this enzyme not working tend to die by the age of about five, and adults with this problem just get kind of more and more sick and more and more tired until they get very, very ill.' Back in 2011, Greenpeace activists actually destroyed a farm growing experimental GM wheat produced by CSIRO. As reported by COSMOS magazine , the protestors entered the farm near Canberra on July 14 and proceeded to mow down fields of GM wheat intended for human trials. As of this writing, not a single meaningful safety test has been conducted on GM wheat as CSIRO appears more concerned with potential profits than with human safety.

0," If you suffer from chronic indigestion, constipation, upset stomach or some other persistent digestive disorder that you are having trouble remedying, essential oils just might be your answer for finding lasting relief. Here are five of the most effective essential oils among many others that can be used to treat chronic digestive distress: 1) Peppermint oil . According to the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), peppermint oil contains unique compounds that can help relax digestive muscles and allow painful digestive gas to pass. If you experience frequent nausea, diarrhea, or menstrual cramps, or suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peppermint oil can also provide lasting relief for these uncomfortable conditions. ( http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/peppermint-000269.htm ) Because of its antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties, peppermint oil can help fight off any harmful invaders that may have taken hold in the digestive tract and triggered irritation. Studies show that taking enteric-coated peppermint capsules -- enteric coating prevents the oil from being released in the stomach, and instead allows it to pass directly into the digestive tract -- can also help eliminate abdominal swelling, flatulence, and abdominal pain. 2) Clove oil . Inflammation of the intestinal lining can cause chronic digestive discomfort and pain for many people. But taking clove oil can help alleviate these symptoms, as it is known to relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract and prevent intestinal spasms, nausea, diarrhea, bloating, and gas. Like peppermint oil, clove oil also possesses unique antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial properties that can help eliminate any pathogens that may be triggering digestive upset. ( http://www.herbcompanion.com/herb-profiles/Eugenol.aspx ) Composed of up to 95 percent eugenol, clove oil has been shown to help treat Candida albicans , yeast infections, and various other fungal overgrowths that can disrupt proper digestive function and, if left unchecked, lead to more serious chronic illnesses down the road. Taking clove oil also tends to stimulate digestive function and energize the body, which makes it a helpful and safe digestive aid to take with meals. 3) Cardamom oil . Recognized for its ability to help stimulate digestion, cardamom oil can help maintain both a healthy colon and a well-functioning digestive tract. Because it helps stimulate the balanced secretion of gastric juices, bile, and other vital digestive acids, cardamom oil makes an excellent remedy for many common digestive disorders, including ulcerative colitis, constipation, acid reflux disease, and diverticulitis, among others. 'Studies confirm that cardamom oil acts as an analgesic and antispasmodic in rats and rabbits, producing relief and lowered distention and writhing within digestive systems reacting negatively to uncomfortable stimuli,' says HerbWisdom.com . 'This effect is the primary medicinal quality of cardamom, and Eastern cultures have been taking advantage of it for centuries.' ( http://www.herbwisdom.com/herb-cardamom.html ) 4) Oil of oregano . Another powerful essential oil you will want to have in your arsenal of digestive remedies is oil of oregano, an extremely powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic healing oil that works better than over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and antibiotics at eliminating harmful pathogens, which are often the cause of digestive problems in many people. By helping to kill off harmful bacteria; for instance, oil of oregano has helped many people restore a proper bacterial balance in their digestive tract. ( http://proliberty.com/observer/20030209.htm ) Because of its incredible antibacterial power, oil of oregano is best taken in cycles only when proper digestion has gotten out of whack. In other words, after several weeks, or perhaps months, of using oil of oregano to help eliminate the pathogens responsible for intestinal upset, it may be best to stop taking it for a while and begin building back up digestive balance with probiotic food and supplements as part of a healthy diet. 5) Tarragon oil . Historically known as the 'herb of the dragon,' tarragon oil has many medicinal uses, which include its powerful ability to stimulate appetite and digestive function. Tarragon oil has long been used throughout history for these and other purposes, and may provide exceptional digestive relief particularly when combined with various other beneficial essential oils. ( http://books.google.com ) Because it also helps fight intestinal worms, tarragon oil can effectively eliminate this common cause of digestive upset in many people. Tarragon oil also helps stimulate the liver's natural production of bile, a critical component of the digestive process that aids in both the assimilation of fats and other nutrients by the body, and the elimination of toxins from the body.

0," In Brave New America, simply acknowledging the historical value of a flag that has always stood for states' rights can earn you the scarlet letter title of 'racist.' If you're an American parent, you also stand to be accused of child abuse if you refuse to inject your kids with vaccinations laced with animal DNA, toxic heavy metals, and live viruses. However, if you are a woman who decided you weren't happy with your natural sex assignment and transformed yourself into a 'man,' American taxpayers will now have to fund your 'right' to undergo free pap smears and mammograms as part of the Obamacare 'tax.' The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that Obamacare health insurance plans will now be required to provide co-pay-free pap smears and mammograms to 'transgender men,' which the federal Office of Personnel Management defines as 'a person assigned the female sex at birth but who identifies as male.' This includes natural-born women who are in the process of converting their bodies into 'men' but who might still have certain female sex organs that require 'preventive' health services. The Frequently Asked Questions section of the latest HHS Obamacare guidelines clearly state that health insurance plans and issuers may not limit 'sex-specific recommended preventive services based on an individual's sex assigned at birth, gender identity or recorded gender.' This means that mentally afflicted individuals like Bruce Jenner, a natural-born male who now identifies as a female and goes by the name of Caitlyn, can simply waltz into a doctor's office and demand to have his fake vagina examined, all on the taxpayers' dime. 'Where an attending provider determines that a recommended preventive service is medically appropriate for the individual -- such as, for example, providing a mammogram or pap smear for a transgender man who has residual breast tissue or an intact cervix ... the plan or issuer must provide coverage for the recommended preventive service, without cost sharing, regardless of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or gender of the individual otherwise recorded by the plan or issuer.' Transgendered individuals may also be furnished with free contraceptives, including abortion-inducing drugs The same FAQ section goes on to discuss recommendations for free contraceptives, including abortion-inducing drugs and IUD devices that block pregnancy, emphasizing that these should be provided for 'all women of reproductive capacity.' This would appear to include all transgendered individuals who identify as women, were born as women, or simply want access to contraceptives made for women. CNS News reports that it tried to contact HHS by email to inquire about whether these contraceptives would be handed out for free to transgendered individuals as well, but the agency has yet to respond. Meanwhile, some 105 lawsuits have been filed against the federal government, according to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, challenging free preventive services like birth control that violate taxpayers' right to refuse paying for coverage that violates their religious beliefs. As all of this is taking place, the federal occupiers are busy erasing America's national sovereignty through fast-track trade deals like TPA and TPP while also deliberately stoking the flames of a possible Civil War II with endless chatter about the Confederate battle flag, which is being removed from its long-time memorial on the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol. The symbolism behind this churlish campaign to eliminate all traces of the Confederate battle flag's historical significance from the national consciousness couldn't be any clearer, especially as those pulling the strings systematically hammer the final nails into the coffin of the United States at the very same time: freedom and liberty are officially dead.

0," Many selfnews readers are probably aware of the many 'cheese-free' cheeses on the market. Most of them are derived from soy, which more often than not is genetically-modified (GMO), and many of them lack the characteristics of cheese that would make a person want to actually eat them. Some do not melt, others do not even taste like cheese, and still others are filled with artificial chemicals and processed fillers. There is one brand, though, that stands apart from the rest. Daiya, a dairy-free, vegan cheese is definitely one of the best cheese alternatives on the market. There are many varieties of cheese alternatives available, but Daiya is arguably the best one out there based on its excellent taste, texture and ingredients. Tapioca and arrowroot flours, non-GMO canola and safflower oils, coconut oil and pea protein are some of the primary ingredients that make up Daiya. Though not certified organic, the product is a good start in an otherwise vacant landscape of quality, vegan cheeses. Because it is still somewhat difficult to source organic gluten-free flours, it makes sense that not every gluten-free product, especially those that are sold on a large scale, is fully organic. As the industry burgeons, the availability of certified organic gluten-free flours should increase, and hopefully Daiya will make this transition in the future. Daiya cheese is free of soy, casein, lactose, gluten, egg, wheat, barley, corn, rice and nuts. There are no artificial ingredients, preservatives, hormones, antibiotics, or animal products of any kind. Daiya melts like cheese , grates like cheese and tastes like cheese. Fortunately, for those with dairy issues, Daiya does not digest like cheese, but rather digests like other whole, plant-based product. Currently, Daiya is used primarily in the foodservice industry, but is growing in retail availability nationwide. It is great for making pizza, as a salad topping, or on a grilled-cheese sandwich, and it contains no cholesterol or trans-fats. It currently comes in two varieties: cheddar and Italian blend. In 2009, Daiya won a 'Product of the Year Veggie Award' from VegNews, America's premier vegetarian lifestyle magazine. Over 35,000 readers voted in the survey, which highlights the best vegetarian products available and is the largest survey of its kind. After tasting it, it is easy to see why it won this award. Daiya truly is a delicious and healthy vegan product. Its only drawbacks are that it is not certified organic, it contains conventional salt rather than sea salt, and it is relatively low in protein. But for what it is, Daiya is one of the best in its class. If you cannot or choose not to eat dairy products but wish to enjoy a meal with cheese every now and again, Daiya is definitely a top choice. Daiya is available at many Whole Foods stores and at many local health food stores nationwide. Some local health restaurants also carry and use Daiya. To learn more about Daiya and to locate a store or restaurant near you that carries it, visit www.daiyafoods.com . "
0," If you're 'Ready for Hillary' in 2016, you might as well just admit that you're ready for more evil because nearly every top donor to Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea's Clinton Foundation, which is driving Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency, is a multinational corporation or other organization pushing for more centralized control over food, medicine, energy and/or finance. A brief look at the top donors to the Clinton Foundation reveals that a Hillary Clinton presidency will focus on spreading more genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) and crop chemicals into places like Africa; pushing more junk food on the masses; perpetuating the privately-owned Federal Reserve's fiat currency Ponzi scheme; and signing more people up for a lifetime of sick care with pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In other words, it'll be a whole lot more of the same under Hillary, just like it's been under Obama and just like it was under Bush Junior, Bush Senior, and many other former presidents. Take a look at the donor list and see for yourself which industries will presumably be given priority treatment from a Hillary presidency based on the large cash sums they're contributing to see Hillary Clinton occupy the White House. The number one donor to the Clinton Foundation, as you'll notice, is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, an organization whose stated goal it is to see every child in the world vaccinated with live viruses and heavy metals . The Gates Foundation is also driving to push native agriculture out of Africa with its 'Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa,' a corporate ploy to force biotechnology on the people of Africa. A couple spots down on the list is Goldman Sachs, the infamous central banking group that holds even more power over the corrupt financial system than the private Federal Reserve. Dave Hodges from The Common Sense Show describes Goldman Sachs as 'the epitome of the word 'evil,'' noting that this evil organization is actively working to implode the global economy in order to reorganize it under a centralized world system. Other top Clinton Foundation donors include junk food purveyor Coca-Cola, mom-and-pop shop killer Walmart, chemical giant Dow, Big Pharma kingpin Pfizer, and the world's most evil corporation, Monsanto. Clinton Foundation so corrupt that even its evil donors are second-guessing campaign contributions You might be thinking to yourself, 'Wait, aren't these the types of organizations that typically donate to Republicans?' Yes, but they also donate to Democrats because Republicans and Democrats are essentially two sides of the same coin. Regardless of what party the U.S. president belongs to, corporations and central banking cartels are the real winners of every election, and this couldn't be more true with a possible Hillary presidency. Interestingly, as evil as many of the Clinton Foundation's donors are, even they are having second thoughts about supporting Hillary. A recent report by Politico explains how the $2 billion organization is losing some donors who are concerned about how the Clintons are using the foundation's money. 'One major donor who contributed at least $500,000 to the foundation last year said a 2015 donation is less likely because of revelations about sloppy record-keeping and huge payments for travel and administrative costs,' wrote Kenneth P. Vogel for Politico . 'At least three other major donors also are re-evaluating whether to continue giving large donations to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, according to people familiar with its fundraising.'

0," Correlations between lifestyle and male fertility have been made in numerous studies over recent years. Some show that well fed sperm cells are most likely to achieve successful fertilization, while others confirm what most of us already suspected: that bad diet and lifestyle choices are an important cause of male infertility. Saturated fats reduce sperm counts, whole grains and fruits boost them Saturated fats, are not just harder to digest, they may even be responsible for dwindling sperm counts in men. A recent study on young Danish men found that those who had a diet high in foods containing a lot of saturated fats (cheese, cream, fatty meats, chocolate and processed foods) also had 38 percent lower sperm concentrations and 41 percent lower sperm counts than men who did not consume an excess of saturated fats. Last year, a Brazilian study found that whole grains have a positive impact on sperm counts and viability, and that increased consumption of fresh fruits boosted sperm speed and agility. Things like obesity, drug, alcohol and coffee consumption, but also excessive heat, have the opposite effect, reducing motility (which describes how well the sperm 'swims'). Top five food groups to boost sperm count Not all fats are created equal: heart-healthy Omega-3 is also great for your sperm. A study published in the journal Human Reproduction found that men who had a higher intake of Omega-3 had the healthiest looking sperms. Flax seeds, chia seeds , hemp, and walnuts are bursting with Omega-3 fats, vitamin D, protein, dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and disease fighting antioxidants. According to best selling pregnancy and parenting author Heidi Murkoff , Omega-3 fats have the ability to improve blood flow to the genital area, which in turn ensures better sexual function and healthier sperm cells. Kale, spinach, collards, asparagus, avocados and beans are loaded with folic acid, which is an important constituent of healthy sperms. Low levels of folic acid have been linked to sperm cells with chromosomal abnormalities. Oysters and blackcurrant, but also spices like mustard, sesame, and celery seeds are excellent sources of zinc and selenium, trace elements that have been strongly linked to male fertility . One study found that zinc deficiency decreased testicular function in four out of five men. Citrus fruits, red peppers and sweet potatoes contain some folic acid as well, but more importantly, they are rich in vitamin C, which is necessary for folic acid absorption. Vitamin C also reduces oxidative stress on sperm cells, improving their life span and motility. Vitamin A is crucial for the maturation of healthy sperm cells. It is used in very precise biological processes that ensure the replication of healthy genetic material. Low vitamin A intake in men could undermine the sperm cells chances of reaching and fertilizing the egg. Heidi Murkoff described sperm low in vitamin A as 'sluggish' in her 2009 best selling book 'What to expect before you're expecting.' "
0," Evidence is increasingly emerging that a Western diet may be a significant risk factor for asthma. Asthma is a growing and serious health problem worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in 2003 asthma was responsible for 4,261 deaths, 484,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million hospital outpatient visits and 1.9 million emergency room visits across the United States. One of the studies providing strong support for a link between asthma and a Western diet was published in the European Respiratory Journal in 2008. French and Mexican researchers divided 54,672 French women into three separate groups, classified by their overall dietary habits: a 'prudent' pattern, characterized by high intake of fruits and vegetables; a 'nuts and wine' pattern, characterized by those foods; and a 'Western' pattern, characterized by high intake of cured meats, pizza, desserts and salty pies. The researchers found that participants in the 'Western' group experienced significantly more asthma attacks than participants in the other groups, while participants in the 'nuts and wine' group (perhaps approximating the Mediterranean diet) experienced significantly fewer. 'Overall diet could be involved in frequent asthma exacerbations, one aspect of asthma severity,' the researchers concluded. Cut out those hamburgers This was followed by a study published in the journal Thorax in 2010, which looked at more than 50,000 children in 20 separate countries. The researchers found that among children living in wealthy countries, eating three or more hamburgers per week was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing asthma . This link was not seen in poorer countries; in all countries, however, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing asthma. A 2013 study, published in the journal Allergy , found an even stronger effect, with children who ate one hamburger per week shown to be 75 percent more likely to suffer from asthma and twice as likely to suffer from wheezing as children who ate fewer hamburgers. Other fast foods were also linked to increased asthma risk. Another large study, also published in 2013, looked not just at hamburgers but at a large number of foods including meat, fish, fast food, dairy products, eggs, fruits and vegetables, potatoes and various grain products. Only fast food intake was significantly associated with increased asthma risk among both younger and older children. Only consumption of fruit three or more times a week was associated with a lower risk in both age groups. Higher fast food intake also increased the occurrence and severity of asthma symptoms in both younger and older children. 'Such consistency adds some weight to the possible causality of the relationship,' the researchers wrote. Change your diet for immediate relief According to a 2010 study conducted by researchers from the University of Newcastle , a high-fat diet like the Western diet might not just increase your risk of developing asthma, but may actually worsen the immediate effects of the disease. Researchers assigned 40 participants to eat either a high-fat meal containing 1,000 calories (52 percent from fat ) or a low-fat meal containing 200 calories (13 percent from fat). The researchers found that immediately after the high-fat meal, participants had significantly higher levels of inflammation-triggering cells called neutrophils in their sputum than participants who had eaten the low-fat meal. In addition, three to four hours after the meal, participants in the high high-fat group were less responsive to an asthma inhaler than those in the low-fat group. 'This suggests that strategies aimed at reducing dietary fat intake may be useful in managing asthma,' researcher Lisa Wood said. "
0," The explosive introduction of new food additives, in addition to an easing of some federal oversight requirements, has allowed manufacturers to dodge scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for ensuring the safety of chemicals that are flowing into the food supply. And, as reported by The Washington Post , in hundreds of cases the FDA is not even aware of the existence of new additives, which can include chemical preservatives, thickening agents and flavorings, interviews and records have shown. 'We simply do not have the information to vouch for the safety of many of these chemicals,' said Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for food, in an interview with the Post . The paper further reported: The FDA has received thousands of consumer complaints about additives in recent years, saying certain substances seem to trigger asthmatic attacks, serious bouts of vomiting, intestinal-tract disorders and other health problems. 'We have questions about whether we can do what people expect' At a rate that has been much faster than in prior years, companies are adding secret ingredients to practically everything. However, the more widespread concern among food-safety advocates and federal regulators is the increasing trend of companies choosing a quicker certification process, at a level never intended when it was created 17 years ago to, in part, help businesses. Once, there was a more formal and time-consuming federal review process in place, where the FDA , not companies themselves, made the final determination on what was safe. That has nearly been completely replaced by a voluntary certification system. The result, say critics, is that consumers now have very little way of knowing, for sure, that the food products they buy won't harm them. 'We aren't saying we have a public health crisis,' Taylor told the Post . 'But we do have questions about whether we can do what people expect of us.' In the 50 years since Congress created and then granted FDA responsibility for ensuring the safety of food additives, the number of them has soared -- from about 800 to more than 9,000. They range from common ingredients like salt to brand-new green tea extracts. The increase in additives has come as a result of demand from busy Americans, most of whom get half their daily meals from processed foods, according to the Post 's summary of government and industry records. And some food additives have been linked to potentially harmful human conditions. For instance, common additives in foods consumed primarily by children have been linked to increases in hyperactivity, The New York Times has reported: The new research, which was financed by Britain's Food Standards Agency and published online by the British medical journal The Lancet, presents regulators with a number of issues: Should foods containing preservatives and artificial colors carry warning labels? Should some additives be prohibited entirely? Should school cafeterias remove foods with additives? FDA has approved tens of thousands of additives over the years In the past six months alone, top officials at the FDA and in the food industry have admitted that new steps should be implemented to ensure better accounting of new food additives that are now proliferating within the food supply. The Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group, has a more aggressive approach: The group filed suit against the FDA earlier this year, charging that the agency has essentially abdicated its additive oversight role. In addition, the Grocery Manufacturers Association provided seed money this past spring to create a research center at Michigan State University, to deal with the rising concerns about additives. As reported by selfnews , the FDA has approved more than 70,000 food additives, from artificial ingredients to genetically modified ones, and from 'all natural' to GRAS -- generally recognized as safe. Cosmetics and personal care products are even worse, with virtually no regulations on chemicals, and your skin absorbs whatever you put on it, and it ends up in the bloodstream, so add that to the 70,000 other food 'criminals.'

0," Bees have been in the news a lot lately, and not for good reasons. Colony collapse disorder has been debated around the world, with fingers being pointed at many culprits. Not only does this crisis affect our overall food production, but it also hampers the production of one of nature's richest and most healing superfoods - bee pollen. A powerhouse of nutrition Bee pollen is considered one of nature's most complete foods. It contains nearly all the nutrients required by humans and about half of its 40% protein content is in the form of free amino acids and is highly bioavailable to the human body. Bee pollen helps correct diets that are nutrient deficient or imbalanced through its remarkable nutrient profile that is not only comprehensive but also very well balanced. It contains the richest known source of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, hormones, enzymes and fats, as well as significant quantities of natural antibiotics. Revel in the nutrients present in this miraculous superfood: A rich source of carotenoids (which convert to vitamin A) Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9 and B12 Vitamin C Vitamin E Calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, potassium, silicon, sulphur and 59 other trace minerals 22 amino acids, which contain five to seven times the amino acids found in equal weights of beef, milk, eggs or cheese Enzymes including amylase, catalase, cozymase, cytochrome, dehydrogenase, diaphorase, diastase, lactic acids, pectase and phosphatase In a nutrient-starved world, incorporating bee pollen with its exceptional vitamin, mineral, amino acid and enzyme profile could go a long way in filling in the gaps of your day to day nutrition. Healing action of bee pollen The overall effects of bee pollen are comprehensive, as it appears to activate systemic biological functions rather than focusing on one physiological area. After many years of testing, bee pollen has also been noted as lacking any harmful side effects, and it is easily digestible and suitable for all ages. The many healing properties of bee pollen include: Promotes growth of healthy new cells Encourages increased tissue repair Enhances toxin elimination Reduces cholesterol levels Regulates blood pressure Increases resistance to infections Stabilizes the nervous system Improves fertility in women Retards growth of tumors Eliminates excessive calcium deposits Helps release excessive uric acid Promotes skin tissue growth and counteracts wrinkling Increases calmness and relaxation Promotes increased concentration and memory Enhances sexual activity Promotes increased strength, stamina, endurance and energy levels Combats cancer, diabetes, arthritis and depression Considering that all disease is partially rooted in nutrient deficiency, it is no wonder why this nutrient-dense superfood has such a positive effect on all the biological functions of the body. How to incorporate bee pollen into your diet When deciding to incorporate bee pollen into your healthy lifestyle, there are a few factors you want to consider, including buying it raw (not pasteurized) and as local as possible. You also want to take care that you do not heat the bee pollen at higher temperatures (above 105F), as it will destroy the delicate enzymes and vitamin C content. A great way to incorporate bee pollen into your diet is by simply eating the granules themselves, or incorporating them into smoothies, yogurt, trail mixes, cereal and oatmeal. Considering the positive effects that bee pollen can have on our diet, and the fact that they pollinate many of the world's crops, let's do our best to support the industry and feel better physically in the process.

0," Despite the ridiculous pharmaceutical-sponsored reports that omega-3 fats and fish oils increase the incidence of certain cancers, including those of the breast and prostate, scientifically validated research studies continue to confirm that the long-chain fats, DHA and EPA, are essential in the prevention and even treatment of many cancer lines. Both oral and skin cancer diagnosis have increased over the past decade as people make fewer trips to the dentist for routine care and slather on sun protective lotions in the misguided belief that they will be protected from the damaging ultraviolet rays of the sun. Researchers from the Queen Mary University of London in the UK, publishing the result of their study in the journal, Carcinogenesis , have found that foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may help in the prevention of early and late-stage oral and skin cancers. The team determined that the fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may offer benefits to people with certain cancers, based on prior studies suggesting that the fatty acid can kill off cancerous cells. Omega-3 fats are shown to induce cancer cell death while protecting healthy tissue from malignancy Scientists tested the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in a laboratory setting using in vitro samples of cancerous cells, and focused their study on one specific type of cancer called squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC). In addition to the skin and mouth, SCC cancer lines can also occur in the lining of the digestive tract, lungs, as well as other areas of the body. The test results showed that omega-3 fatty acids induced cell death in malignant and pre-malignant cells in doses that did not affect normal cells. Lead study researcher Dr. Kenneth Parkinson concluded, 'We found that the omega-3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre-malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells... surprisingly, we discovered this was partly due to an over-stimulation of a key growth factor (epidermal growth factor) which triggered cell death. This is a novel mechanism of action of these fatty acids.' The scientists determined that since the dose of omega-3 fats required to kill cancer cells did not affect normal cell function, the long-chain fats could be used for the prevention and treatment of oral and skin cancers. Omega-3 fats are found in abundance in their bioavailable form mainly in oily, fatty fish. Nutritionists recommend two to three servings of fish per week, ideally obtained from an organically harvested, deep water source to avoid the possibility of mercury contamination. Additionally, walnuts, flax and chia seeds are good sources of omega-3 fats, but must be converted through a multi-step process in the body to be available for metabolic processes. Many health-minded individuals prefer to supplement with fish oil capsules (1,200 to 2,400 mg EPA/DHA per day) to improve brain health, prevent a potentially fatal heart attack and lower the risk of developing many types of malignancies including oral and skin cancers.

0," Xanthan gum was discovered in the 1960s and was approved in 1968 as a food additive in the USA and Europe. It is mostly used as an emulsifier. It is made from bacteria that create black spots on broccoli and cauliflower. Xanthan gum at first is a slimy, gooey, fermented substance, but during processing it's dried up and finally ground into a fine white powder. You can bet your first and last mutated gene that the corn sugar used to make xanthan gum is not certified organic, but rather genetically modified. So why then is xanthan found in some organic products? They must be using organic corn, but if it doesn't say certified organic corn right on the label, I'm not touching it. Plus, xanthan gum can also be derived from dairy, wheat and soy, which is almost always GMO , so people with those allergies watch out! You're catching a double dose of one of those extra 'little' ingredients you thought wasn't affecting your system. You thought wrong. It ALL adds up. ( http://www.uky.edu ) This thickening agent contains a lot of fiber also, causing digestive irritation and other disruptions like bloating, but that's just the beginning. That's just your body telling you that you just ate something synthetic and toxic. Xanthan is substituted for gluten in many foods, because it has that 'sticky' consistency or quality, so all these folks looking for gluten-free foods could be consistently eating some GMO 'gum.' Maybe that's what's stuck in those divots, causing you abdominal pain . Think about it, if you chewed gum all day and swallowed it when you were done chewing, how would you feel after three to five slices? Take a good guess what xanthan gum is doing to your insides. Xanthan gum - just another industrial, processed food byproduct Wherever you find xanthan gum listed as an ingredient, expect to find other sinister additives (food agent criminals) lurking in the same product. Typical accomplices include ' natural flavors' which are not usually in accordance with vegan or vegetarian standards. Natural flavors themselves add a twist to what you will eat. In fact, glutamates, animal products and even allergens may be the actual source of those so-called 'natural flavors,' and typically are exactly that. Are you allergic to carrageenan, the thickener and stabilizer? What about soy lecithin? What food allergies did you get as a child from the food additives in flu shots and vaccines? Peanut oil and MSG might be the culprits of that, sticking around in your body for years , along with that gluten you consume. Did your allergy doctor talk about that, or did he prescribe you some stomach meds with aspartame in the ingredients. They do that you know. Big Pharma puts aspartame in medicines for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Or, maybe you're all 'congested' and YOUR doctor likes to prescribe you antihistamines, to 'open you up' and to shrink those membranes, so your body won't produce what it needs to in order to flush all those synthetic food additives out? 'Dear Allopathy: Please go away, because you're not helping anyone! ( http://www.selfnews.com ) Who needs health problems? Since most flavoring is lost during processing of just about any kind, for factory food, 'added flavor' and 'shelf stability' are commonplace. It's most commonly found in salad dressings, sauces, ice creams and gluten-free foods. There are many 'factory' eaters out there, who like their food coming to them canned and boxed, and those foods take up most of their pantry. Xantham gum may be used to help gluten-free flours resemble wheat-based flours. So, if you already know the wheat scam , and you're well aware of the gluten scam , then you're looking for something free of those, and that's where this scary additive conveniently shows up. Big Food tries to catch you wherever they can. Get real smart here and you'll feel the difference, I'm telling you. Factory 'people' eat factory food daily First of all, there is absolutely no nutritional value at all in it. Xanthan gum is used in skin care products, dental products, pharmaceuticals and industrial and household cleaning products. Still want to eat it? Still want to turn a blind eye? If someone told you there was some sticky AJAX in your food, would you still be eating it? The products from which xanthan is derived are all likely to be genetically modified, yet somehow it's still approved to be used in organic foods, maybe only if it's less than 5% of total ingredients. You won't find this gum funk by itself though. Also, xanthan acts as a laxative, so when combined with high-fiber flour, you could easily compound health problems, like IBS or colitis. So those 'gluten-free' recipes and pre-boxed foods claiming to be 'all natural' and healthy might just be the beginning of your miserable stomachache that won't seem to go away. Add xanthan gum to the other 70,000 additives, preservatives and chemical agents that the FDA allows in U.S. food and you have a real 'search for the cure' scam working the masses to their graves. Get smart. Educate and 'Fooducate' yourself. It's easy and free: ( http://fooducate.com/ ). Stay 100% organic if you can and protect your one and only body from genetically mutated GUM! "
0," How much aluminum is in your drinking water? It's hard to tell, but in a 15-year study on French elderly men and women, regular consumption of tap water was associated with aluminum toxicity and increased prevalence of dementia. How might the accumulation of aluminum from just tap water alone affect your cognitive ability as you age? In the 15 years of study, researchers found out that dietary aluminum from water sources could be a risk factor for developing dementia. They also found a helpful solution. They found that the mineral silica could help decrease the risk of aluminum-induced dementia in elderly patients. A 2009 report from the American Journal of Epidemiology details this 15-year study from France. The study followed the lives of 1,925 elderly patients between the years 1988 and 2003. All of the elderly men and women were selected from 91 different municipalities with different water sources in southern France. Their aluminum intake levels were studied, from water and other sources, as the researchers investigated the metal's role in bringing about dementia throughout the 15-year period. During that time, the researchers also investigated the impact of silica in reducing participants' risk of dementia. Aluminum from drinking water increased dementia in 15-year study Of the nearly 2,000 elderly studied, none showed any signs of dementia beginning in 1988. The researchers ruled out environmental aluminum intake factors during the study and focused solely on aluminum intake from water. The participants' daily consumption of tap and bottled water was recorded. Reliable water assessment data was analyzed. In the study, aluminum consumption greater than or equal to 0.1 mg per day from drinking water was correlated with declining cognitive ability. Over the years, the accumulation of aluminum inflicted negative mental effects, welcoming dementia in what was once a mentally healthy group of elderly adults. Using the scientific Cox model, the researchers found that highest exposure to aluminum may be a risk factor for full-blown dementia. Hoping to the help the participants, the researchers looked further and assessed silica intake for its ability to reduce dementia. What they discovered was that when participants increased their silica intake by 10 mg/day, incidences of dementia subsided. The change was drastic. This discovery coincides with the expert analysis of Dr. Chris Exley, PhD. Doctor recommends silica to help those affected by aluminum from vaccines At a January 2011 vaccine safety conference in Jamaica, Dr. Exley talked about ways to reduce the toxic effects of aluminum in the body. He talked about the importance of silica and mentioned two brands of silica-enhanced water, Volvic and Spritzer. After conducting several urine tests, Exley and his team of researchers proved that high-silica mineral waters help remove aluminum from the body. In a presentation involving victims of Gardasil's adverse reactions, Exley showed how silica improved the damages caused by aluminum-laced vaccines. Based off 20 years of study, Dr. Exley recommends drinking a liter of silica-rich water daily to reduce the burden of accumulated aluminum in the body. Sources of silica Thankfully, silica mineral water isn't the only place to obtain this important mineral. According to the 1993 book Silica: The Forgotten Nutrient , by Klaus Kaufmann, silica can be found primarily in the following foods (Silica content is measured in mg.): "
0," Today is a milestone day for selfnews because it is the first time we are officially endorsing the platform of a political party. However, the Canary Party is really more of an activism group right now with the aim of influencing elections. You are not likely to actually see Canary Party candidates any time in the very near future (although you might a few years out). What is the Canary Party? It's a group of moms, dads, concerned citizens and scientists who recognize the severe harm being caused to our world and our children by toxic heavy metals and synthetic chemicals found in vaccines, medicines, foods, personal care products and even products for the home. Their published mission statement is : The Canary Party is a movement created to stand up for the victims of medical injury, environmental toxins and industrial foods by restoring balance to our free and civil society and empowering consumers to make health and nutrition decisions that promote wellness. The Canary Party recognizes, as I do, that neither Republicans nor Democrats are ever going to deal with these issues. Both parties have been wholly compromised, bought off and hijacked by corporate interests. The democrats feign a belief in 'environmentalism' but utterly fail to talk about GMOs, mercury in vaccines or toxic additives in everyday foods. Republicans, for their part, want virtually zero regulation on drug companies, food companies and chemical manufacturers, allowing them all to continue poisoning our world with no regulatory oversight whatsoever. Both of these parties fail to recognize how our world, our food and our children are being systematically poisoned by destructive corporations and failed regulatory policies. In terms of lesser-known politically parties, the Green Party seems hopelessly lost in carbon dioxide delusions , and the Tea Party, while doing great work in the realm of liberty, simply doesn't have foods, drugs and environmental chemicals anywhere on its radar. The Canary Party stands for freedom from the systematic poisoning of our world Click here to read the Canary Party position paper . It includes these gems, which selfnews readers will find affirming: In the investigation and management of these and other modern-day plagues, our leading medical institutions have done more than merely fail us, their conduct lies at the root of the problem. Their agents have censored important science, manipulated data, intimidated honest scientists, and deceived the public. Worst of all, they have cloaked themselves in the mantle of science and 'evidence-based medicine' as they have circled the wagons to defend their policies, profits and programs. In the meantime, their conduct and behavior is perpetuating one of the most egregious and systematic episodes of scientific denial in human history. The issue of the mass poisoning of humanity transcends all other political concerns except for liberty. Freedom from being covertly poisoned by unethical corporations is, in fact, a form of liberty. So, in essence, the Canary Party is founded in liberty and focused on some of its most important areas of application: medical freedom, health freedom, food freedom and freedom from harm by insidious corporations that spew chemicals with no regard for the sanctity of life. The Canary Party, for example, believes in 'vaccine choice' -- the idea that individuals and parents should have the right to choose whether they wish to be vaccinated rather than having vaccines forced upon them by the state. This idea of medical freedom is essential to liberty and it is found in the debates leading up to the creation of the United States Constitution (see the writings of Dr. Benjamin Rush ). A state that believes it has the right to force medicines upon the People -- including medicines containing admitted neurotoxins such as MSG, formaldehyde and mercury -- is a state that does not believe in liberty. It is no longer a government 'of the People' but a government that targets the people with 'medicines of mass destruction' which cause untold harm, suffering and even death across the population. This practice must stop, and the Canary Party is rallying Americans from all political persuasions to join together in taking a stand against the brand of medical slavery, medical monopolism and the attempted destruction of holistic health alternatives to the drugs-and-poison status quo. Who is joining the Canary Party? The Canary Party is currently being joined by: Parents of vaccine-damaged children Veterans damaged by forced military vaccinations Medical professionals who understand the importance of avoiding exposure to toxic elements True environmentalists who seek to protect life from destruction Notice that the Canary Party does not take a position on immigration, gay marriage, voting rights or other social issues. The party is focused entirely on halting the mass chemical poisoning of our families, our children and our planet. Who is running the Canary Party? The only person I really know in the Canary Party is Sherri Tenpenny, and she's a brilliant, science-minded researcher with a lot to teach the world about vaccines and immunology. As of yet, I don't know the other Canary Party members very well, so this is not a personal endorsement of each and every person involved in the Canary Party; it's an endorsement of the Canary Party platform and philosophy -- something that's far larger than any individual or group. The philosophy of the Canary Party is powerful and timeless. Whereas the currently philosophy of Democrats and Republicans is to protect POWER, the philosophy of the Canary Party is to protect LIFE. This recipe of protecting life, liberty and happiness, in fact, is a founding principle of the United States of America, but it has been long lost as wicked men and women have risen to power in the Senate, the House and the White House, incessantly seeking to benefit themselves at the expense of the nation. This is how we ended up with Obamacare, Bush's wars in the Middle East, secret military torture bases and NSA surveillance run wild. As our liberty was being systematically eroded by a rogue federal government, our foods, lands and bodies were also being routinely contaminated by chemical pesticides, herbicides, food additives and GMOs. Today, we face not merely the collapse of our global banking system and national debt; we face extinction as a species. And if we do not halt the mass poisoning of our world by drug companies, processed food factories and toxic chemical manufacturers, we won't have much of a world left to fight over in just a few generations. A vision for the real future of humanity While the Republicans and Democrats are looking ahead to only the next election, the Canary Party is looking ahead to the future of life on our planet and working on ways for humanity to survive (and reproduce). No other political party has the foresight -- nor the courage -- to grasp the urgency of these issues. While traditional parties are arguing over jobs, immigration and food stamps, the Canary Party is trying to figure out how we survive the next century without killing ourselves and destroying our civilization. Throughout human history, civilizations have fallen into ruin based on lack of foresight. Current Western civilization is no wiser than that of the Romans, and in many ways our modern world is far more toxic, deadly and destructive than that of the Roman empire. We now have destructive technologies the Romans couldn't have dreamed of: nuclear weapons (and power plants), genetically engineered foods, synthetic chemical preservatives, viral fragments injected into children and called 'vaccinations,' and so on. Western civilization has invented more ways to poison, destroy, intoxicate and pollute our world than any other civilization before it. Yet most members of today's civilization share the common delusion that this destructive way of life on our planet is somehow infinitely sustainable... that somehow the toxic carrying capacity of a human being, or an ecosystem or even a planet is limitless. Under the guise of corporate profits, humanity has blindly lurched forward to the march of 'science!' into a deadly trap of its own making. It is no exaggeration to say that today's food, drug and agricultural giants have brought humankind to the brink of destruction. (For starters, just research the collapse of food pollinators to get an idea of how dire the current situation really is. Just last winter in North America, one-third of honeybee colonies perished...) Only by recognizing the urgency of this global challenge (and taking action to halt the mass poisoning) do we have any real hope of surviving the next century. In the United States, there is no other political party that possesses sufficient long-term vision to even recognize this problem, much less act on it. Only the Canary Party grasps the seriousness of this and has the willingness to do something about it. Everybody else is basically just arguing about how to arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic while the ship goes down. Watch for the Canary Party to make a noticeable impact in the 2014 elections. selfnews is going to help spread the word and make sure candidates realize that those who side with dangerous, deadly corporations are going to be exposed as 'poisoners' who are murdering humankind.

0," The article which originally appeared here has been removed because it is no longer aligned with the science-based investigative mission of selfnews. In late 2013 / early 2014, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger), editor of selfnews, transitioned from outspoken activist to environmental scientist. He now runs the selfnews Forensic Food Lab, conducting world-class food science research and publishing scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through scientific investigation powered by university-level analytical instrumentation, Adams found that, much like the majority of the population, he had been suffering over the past several years from chronic exposure to cumulative toxic elements found in the food supply, including in many organics and 'superfoods.' His findings -- as well as breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, protective food nutrients and the cognitive influences of food contaminants -- are being published at selfnews.com. Notably, Adams found that exposure to toxic elements in foods altered his mindset, outlook on life and degree of happiness in the world. 'I now know that much of my outlook on the world was being negatively shaped by toxic elements found not just in everyday foods, but also in some superfoods and dietary supplements,' Adams now explains. Adams spent much of 2013 painstakingly testing his food intake for the presence of toxic elements, then taking therapeutic steps to eliminate those toxic elements from his body. 'After about six months of intense detoxification, I experienced a sudden, involuntary shift in my worldview. Fear transformed into a sense of calm. Uncertainty was replaced by inspiration. I felt a new sense of awakening and optimism combined with a strong desire to contribute meaningful knowledge to humanity,' Adams explains. As part of this transformation, Adams felt himself drawn into the realm of scientific investigations and analytical chemistry. He spent an intense six months studying university-level chemistry and learning methodologies of atomic spectroscopy , a technology used to quantitatively assess metals, minerals, toxic elements and radioactive isotopes found in all foods, beverages, soils and physical matter. By the end of 2013, Adams had completed extensive training in laboratory instrumentation and high-level chemistry, and he now operates ICP-MS atomic spectroscopy instrumentation which he uses to conduct world-class investigative research on foods, beverages and personal care products such as cosmetics. The ICP-MS instrument he uses is capable of detecting toxic elements at parts per trillion concentrations. His current research not only covers toxic elements but also radioactive isotopes and the global contamination of the food supply with fallout from nearly 70 years of atomic bomb testing. He has begun intensive research on the radioactive contamination of ocean foods from the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, and he has developed unique scientific methologies surrounding the detection and interpretation of data involving radioactive isotopes such as Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Uranium-235. Focused on food science solutions for humanity The Health Ranger's research is now focused on helping save humanity from toxic elements in foods and the environment, including food toxins, water toxins, GMO toxins, pesticides and herbicides, radioactive elements from nuclear accidents and nuclear testing, contaminated soils, adulterated foods and more. Through this research, Adams developed several breakthrough discoveries in food technology, toxicology and nutrition, and he has authored several scientific papers which are being published in 2014. 'Each of these discoveries has the potential to not just save millions of lives across the globe,' Adams explains, 'but to radically reshape the future of human civilization in a positive direction free from war, poisons and environmental destruction.' His new mission is to freely share his discoveries with the world so that humanity can heal from what he calls 'a century of industrial contamination that has driven the human race into a self-intoxicating spiral of clinical insanity.' Mike Adams (aka the 'Health Ranger') is also the executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center ( www.ConsumerWellness.org ), an organization which has already awarded tens of thousands of dollars worth of grants around the world for prenatal nutrition and children's nutrition programs. Click here to see some of the CWC's success stories . Once an outspoken critic and activist, Adams now sees far greater potential in scientific discovery and problem solving. 'One of the things that came out of my own personal healing from toxic element contamination was a rewened, almost hyper-magnified sense of compassion for fellow human beings. Coupled with that, I was blessed with the cognitive capacities needed to discover a new paradigm of scientific knowledge that can help end suffering and eradicate much of the degenerative disease, mental illness and behavioral violence that currently plagues humankind. My deepest desire is to share this knowledge with the world and show others how to use it to heal their minds and bodies, their families, their communities, their nations and ultimately our fragile civilization.' 'Everything is at stake. If we do not change course, human civilization will not survive its own poisoning,' Adams warns. 'But now, thanks to these extraordinary discoveries, we have a blueprint for a way out that can put humankind back on a path of abundance, sanity, health, happiness, cooperation rather than conflict, and accelerated awakening of human consciousness and scientific progress.'

0," Scientific breakthroughs often come from unlikely sources, and a recent discovery has proved to be no exception. Who would have imagined a connection between moldy bread and 'greener' electrical batteries? As odd as it may sound, scientists have found a way to use the fungus found in common bread mold to generate materials that produce electricity, and the discovery may pave the way to manufacturing batteries in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. The fungus, called Neurospora crassa , has the ability to transform manganese into materials that can be used in making electrochemical battery components. From the UK's Daily Mail : 'A team in Dundee has been developing bread moulds to transform materials, with previous research showing the fungi could be used to convert toxic lead and uranium into more stable materials. 'In their latest study, the researchers converted manganese into minerals ideal for use in lithium-ion batteries and capacitors, which store electric charge in a chemical form. ''We have made electrochemically active materials using a fungal manganese bio-mineralisation process,' said Professor Geoffrey Gadd of the University of Dundee, who led the research. 'Gadd's team incubated N. crassa with manganese chloride and urea, a natural waste product, and found that the long filaments grown by the fungus became covered by minerals.' When heated, the treated fungus produces manganese oxides and carbon biomass both of which are ideally suited for use in manufacturing battery electrodes and capacitors. 'The electrochemical properties of the carbonized fungal biomass-mineral composite were tested in a supercapacitor and a lithium-ion battery, and it [the composite] was found to have excellent electrochemical properties,' said professor Gadd. There has been other research conducted in an effort to find ways to improve the performance of these types of batteries and capacitors, but the Dundee researchers believe that they may now have found the key to more sustainable battery production. Potential for home-generated sustainable energy Professor Gadd envisions a future in which this process could be used to generate energy at home using moldy bread : 'A lot of people make their own wine and beer for example, and there's not much difference. In theory, people could do this kind of thing at home if they wanted to.' Paul Graham, chief economist with the CSIRO, predicts that more 'quirky' innovations will soon emerge that may be applied in the home energy sector. From ABC.net.au: 'I think we'll see a lot of activity in this space. What's driving that of course is we've had quite an increase in electricity prices and with solar coming along, it's got a lot of people thinking about what can they do themselves? 'I think there were just a lot of people who wanted to move to green power because the government might have been dragging its feet, then there's a whole group of people who just want to save money on their bills as power prices go up. 'And I think we've also just got a group of customers who are the fast adapters, who just like to get involved in new technology. 'So I think there's a lot of different motivations, but it's all helping to drive down the cost of this stuff for the average person.' Goodbye grid? Inexpensive self-sustainable energy production at home is becoming a reality. As small-scale green energy production and battery storage systems continue becoming cheaper and more efficient, we may soon be able to produce and store all the energy needed to run our homes . Of course, this is not good news for power companies and those who wish to maintain centralized control over energy production and consumption. It will be interesting to see what happens when home energy production becomes cheaper and more practical than staying plugged into the grid and we may not have to wait too much longer to find out.

0," 'As auto sales boomed after World War II, and drivers in powerful new cars increasingly asked service station attendants to 'fill 'er up with ethyl,' they were unwittingly creating a crime wave two decades later,' reports Mother Jones in 'America's Real Criminal Element: Lead.' As it turns out, contact with lead can give rise to aggressive and delinquent behavior, not to mention learning disabilities and lower IQ scores. When leaded gasoline was phased out in the 1970s, an interesting phenomena occurred: the crime rate substantially and consistently dropped. All the same, exposure to the heavy metal hasn't disappeared completely as it still hides in the most ordinary of places - and, predictably, continues to bring about a spectrum of health and behavioral disorders. The link between lead and criminality Kim N. Dietrich, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine , believes that lead can 'miswire' developing brains in children, affecting areas of judgement, impulse control and anticipation of consequences - which ultimately can provoke aggressive behavior. In the late 1970s, Dietrich and a team of other investigators began to study some 300 pregnant women who lived in Cincinnati neighborhoods (usually the inner city) that were known for high numbers of lead poisoning cases. According to Chemical and Engineering News : 'From the time they were born until they were six-and-a-half years old, the young participants had their blood-lead levels measured 23 times. The average childhood concentration for the whole group was 13 g/dL. Now adults in their 30s, the subjects are having their brains scanned and behaviors analyzed. And the results are eerie. As of 2008, 250 members of the lead study had been arrested a total of 800 times. The participants' average blood-lead levels during childhood also correlated with their arrest rate.' A modern health threat Today we may not give much thought to lead exposure, thanks to the protective measures set in place over the years by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Unfortunately, despite these efforts, the heavy metal is still present within our daily lives, silently obstructing the mental and physical health of children and adults alike. '... getting a dangerous dose is more common today than you realize - thanks to sources you'd never expect, such as ceramic dishes, art supplies, and even vegetables grown in city gardens. And although average blood lead levels are way down, new research shows that even low amounts can be harmful,' states Johns Hopkins University professor Ellen Silbergeld, PhD, in 'Lead dangers still lurk in unexpected places.' Even small amounts of lead (4 ug/dl) in the blood can double the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke. The same level can also encourage memory loss. Since lead is stored in the bones, when we have periods of high bone turnover (after a fracture, at menopause or during pregnancy), the metal is released into the blood, resulting in high blood pressure and kidney problems. Hunting and fishing, home renovations, cosmetics, and even faucet fixtures are often sources of exposure. To learn how to protect yourself, have a look at these recommendations. "
0," Deep down, we all have a deeply rooted desire to live a long and high quality life. Modern medicine is certainly enabling us to live longer, but often at a cost that creates a much lower quality of life. So how do we live a longer life and also enjoy the high quality that we all wish we could capture, so we can remain as youthful as possible up until our demise? These 5 tips are a great start. Improve your diet Eating a healthy diet is one of the primary components to a long and healthy life. However, due to a contaminated and nutrient deficient food supply, incorporating a healthy diet has become more difficult. Choosing a whole food diet that is as fresh, clean, and as raw as possible is a big step forward in improving your longevity and quality of life. Examples of these types of whole foods include: "
0," Most Americans would agree the state of the nation is less than ideal. Unemployment is at record highs, home foreclosures are driving people onto the street, health care remains a disastrous failure and the population is more diseased, obese and depressed than ever before. In a newly-published special report, selfnews.com editor Mike Adams (the Health Ranger) argues that all these problems have a common cause : Poor nutrition. The full, free report is available at: http://www.selfnews.com/report_Nutrition_... In it, the Health Ranger explains that virtually all the major problems facing America today have their roots in nutritionally-depleted, over-processed, chemically-contaminated foods. Turning America around, he says, starts within changing what Americans eat. Replacing junk processed foods and chemical additives with fresh produce and superfoods will automatically lead to vast improvements across America, including: Greatly reduced health care costs and far lower rates of disease. Enhanced cognitive function, creativity and productivity. Vastly improved results in education. Huge reductions in crime and prison populations. A stronger Democracy and improved voting results. Enhanced happiness and longevity of the population. Improved international competitiveness, both academically and economically. 'Eating healthy is patriotic,' says Adams. 'One of the best things you can do for your country is eat a truly healthful diet that's free from junk foods and chemical additives.' Read more in the full report here: http://www.selfnews.com/report_Nutrition_... Why junk food is destroying America If America fails to transition to a more healthful diet, Adams says, it will eventually collapse under the weight of a diseased population, a failed health care system and a failed economy. America's junk food habit is destroying the nation much like the Romans suffered lead poisoning from their own aqueducts. 'Americans are being poisoned by the national food supply,' explains Adams, 'And you can't have a successful country when your population is fed a nutritionally-compromised diet.' The true pathway to health care reform, he says, is to start with food supply reform . And that begins with agricultural reform and radical reforms in food subsidies. Subsidies on harmful ingredients like processed sugar and high-fructose corn syrup must be halted, he explains, and new incentives for the growing and consumption of unprocessed, fresh produce need to be explored. 'No nation can maintain a position of world leadership when its people are living in a state of extreme nutritional deficiency,' Adams says. 'Every successful nation must have, at its core, a healthy, creative and productive population. And that can only be achieved through the dedicated pursuit of nutrition and healthy diets.'

0," In the largest criminal fine ever levied against any drug company in the world, a unit of U.S.-based Pfizer, Inc. was sentenced to pay $1.3 billion in criminal fines and revenue forfeiture. It's all part of a $2.3 billion settlement announced by the Justice Department. The case centers around Pfizer's criminal 'off-label marketing' of four drugs, including the painkiller Bextra. After whistleblowers filed lawsuits in three states, the U.S. Justice Department took an interest in the case and prosecuted Pfizer for criminal acts. In the settlement, Pfizer admitted to a felony crime and agreed to pay $2.3 billion in fines and other fees. The investigation of Pfizer reportedly turned up evidence that Pfizer engaged in kickback payments to doctors for nine drugs, including Viagra and Lipitor. Part of the reason the penalty against Pfizer was so large is because the company was considered a 'repeat offender' in promoting drugs for unapproved uses (which is a violation of federal law). Off-label marketing makes a mockery of modern medicine So-called 'off-label' marketing of drugs is rampant in the pharmaceutical industry. Although the FDA, drug companies and many conventional doctors claim the drug industry is guided by a 'gold standard' of scientific scrutiny, the truth is that pharmaceuticals are routinely marketed and prescribed for health conditions for which they have never even been studied ... much less actually approved by the FDA. The fact that this continues today makes a mockery of any 'scientific credibility' the pharmaceutical industry claims to possess. Drug companies take advantage of this gaping hole in regulatory oversight by getting their drugs approved by the FDA for one health condition, then heavily promoting it for numerous unrelated conditions. A drug approved for high blood pressure, for example, could be openly marketed for diabetes or Alzheimer's disease even though there is no evidence whatsoever showing the drug to be either safe or effective for such conditions. The same is true with the intended demographics of pharmaceuticals: Drug companies often get their drugs approved for adults, then they market those drugs to children even though the drugs have never been tested with children. The result is a pharmaceutical industry that appears to be highly regulated, but isn't. Virtually any drug can be pushed for any disease for almost any reason -- all with virtually no oversight by the FDA. In fact, in this Pfizer case, even with the Justice Department filing criminal charges against Pfizer, the FDA has stood by and done absolutely nothing to prevent such actions from being repeated in the future by Pfizer or another drug company.

0," Nichole Rolfe (formerly Bruff) was expelled from the nursing program at Baker College in 2013 for 'harassment of staff.' Rolfe readily admits that she had respectfully questioned two of her teachers during classroom discussions when each of them instructed the students to use diversion, misinformation, threats, and blatant lies to coerce their patients (not theoretical patients- current hospital patients) to comply with vaccination demands. Within two weeks of these incidences, Rolfe was expelled from the program with no warning, no recourse, and no right to appeal. On April 5, 2015, Rolfe and her lawyer filed charges against the college. First Instructor: Lie About Reason for Vaccinations - Give Misinformation - Deflect Fears and Concerns The first instructor named in the complaint, Connie Smith, Assistant Director of Nursing, instructed the students to tell expectant mothers and their partners that they were not allowed access to the labor and delivery floor until they received a DTaP vaccine. The reason given for this demand was the safety and protection the vaccine would give to the newborns. The instructor was clear in her directives that the nursing students were to misrepresent facts and disregard patients' concerns, including fears of vaccine injuries. Rolfe questioned the deception- the reality that vaccinations would not provide protection for 4-6 weeks, therefore they would not in any way protect the hospital newborns from disease. She asked why she would be required to participate in behavior contrary to ethical and legal standards regarding informed consent. The instructor ended the discussion, stating they would pick it up at a later time. Code of Ethics for Nurses, American Nurses Association Excerpt: 1.4 The Right to Self-Determination Respect for human dignity requires the recognition of specific patient rights, in particular, the right to self-determination. Patients have the moral and legal right to determine what will be done with and to their own person; to be given accurate, complete, and understandable information in a manner that facilitates an informed decision; and to be assisted with weighing the benefits, burdens, and available options in their treatment, including the choice of no treatment. They also have the right to accept, refuse, or terminate treatment without deceit, undue influence, duress, coercion, or prejudice, and to be given necessary support throughout the decision- making and treatment process. Such support includes the opportunity to make decisions with family and significant others and to obtain advice from expert, knowledgeable nurses and other health professionals. Instructor Two: Give Sick Children Vaccines and Threaten Medicare Recipients Two days after this incident, the second instructor named in the complaint, Alysia Osoff, gave instructions for the students to use any means necessary to bring pediatric patients up-to-date on their vaccines before their discharge from the hospital. She told the students to lie to the parents receiving Medicare and to threaten them by telling them that non-compliance could result in Medicare refusing to pay their hospital bill, making them liable for the charges. Again, Rolfe questioned the instruction. First she questioned why sick children would be targeted for vaccination when the drug inserts (instructions) clearly warn against vaccinating sick children. Then Rolfe questioned the ethics and legality of lying to parents and threatening them to gain vaccination compliance. Rolfe maintains that she remained calm and professional throughout this exchange while Osoff '... became completely unhinged...' The directions given by these two instructors were in complete contradiction to the training these nursing students had received including written information in their textbooks. More importantly, the instructions violated the law, ethics, and morality. This lack of integrity mirrors the doctrine of the pro-vaccine camp with its endemic lies, manipulations, and threats. In addition to Rolfe's honesty and integrity, she was an 'A' student , 20 weeks from graduation. Her expulsion not only ended her training at Baker College, it left her blackballed for other schools. We can only hope Nichole Rolfe is successful in her lawsuit and her goal to become a nurse practitioner/midwife and that she finds excellent employment with like-minded professionals.

0," Today's doctors-in-training are learning how to think critically and clearly about the need for -- and potential dangers of -- any drugs they prescribe. And surgeons only operate if they are physically and mentally able to make sure they will not be putting their patient in any danger, right? Unfortunately, two new papers show that those assumptions are wrong. In fact, they reveal critical reasons why mainstream medicine can be a danger to your health and even threaten your life. Bottom line: med students are being taught through a hidden curriculum devised and carried out by Big Pharma (and allowed by medical schools) to push the prescribing of their drugs. Meanwhile, countless surgeons are operating and sometimes harming patients because they are impaired by fatigue and lack of sleep. Here are the facts. Medical students in the United States are being bombarded with the pro-drug propaganda of pharmaceutical companies -- and the students are exposed to this throughout their education, even in the years before they have clinical experience treating patients. According to research led by Kirsten Austad and Aaron S. Kesselheim from Harvard Medical School just published in PLoS Medicine , it turns out the drug giants have created what the Harvard researchers have dubbed a highly influential hidden curriculum that pushes doctors-in-training into accepting and promoting Big Pharma's prescription drugs and other therapies. The enormous and ongoing contact with drug companies is associated with medical professionals developing positive attitudes about the marketing of prescription medications. Moreover, the med students are not developing any healthy skepticism about potential negative implications of the drug pushing techniques -- or the drugs themselves. The Harvard research team studied all published studies on this topic and collected the results from a total of 9,850 medical students studying at 76 different medical schools. The results showed that most medical students were interacting with the pharmaceutical industry and that contact increased in the clinical years. In fact, up to 90 percent of all students working with patients in clinics were receiving some form of educational materials from none other than Big Pharma. And most of the medical students thought it was fine and dandy to accept gifts from drug manufacturers. They justified taking these freebies by claiming they were entitled to gifts from drug manufacturers because they had financial hardships; some med students said it must be ethical because most other students accepted gifts, too. Almost two-thirds of students claimed that despite the fact they were receiving promotions, gifts and having other interactions with Big Pharma sales representatives, they were somehow miraculously immune from any bias from all this attention and all the 'extras' from drug companies. Student opinions were split on whether physician-industry interactions should be regulated either by medical schools or the government. The authors of the new study recommend better education for medical students on the subject of physician and drug industry relationships and they are also pushing for medical institutions to support reforms such as rules limiting the contact students have with Big Pharma marketing. However, in a statement to the media, the researchers noted it could be difficult to change the influence of the drug giants who seem to have a stronghold on medical schools and students. 'Given the potential for educational and institutional messages to be counteracted by the hidden curriculum, changes should be directed at faculty and residents who serve as role models for medical students,' the scientists concluded. 'These changes can help move medical education a step closer to two important goals: the cultivation of strong professional values, as well as the promotion of a respect for scientific principles and critical review of evidence that will later inform clinical decision-making and prescribing practices.' Another article just published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) shows that doctors -- both residents still in training and experienced physicians -- may be putting patients at risk due to sleep deprivation. 'The problem may only be getting worse,' CMAJ editors Drs. Noni MacDonald, Paul Hebert, Ken Flegel and Matthew Stanbrook wrote in an editorial. 'Medical care today is more complex than in decades past....Increasing complexity of care at the bedside or in the operating theatre places unprecedented cognitive and physical demands on doctors who oversee and deliver care in these environments.' They noted that a recent study indicated that lack of sleep is causing higher rates of surgical complications, especially if a surgeon had less than six hours of sleep the preceding night.

0," There is new concern over evidence that growth and sex hormones in beef can cause genital abnormalities in boys, and early onset of puberty in girls. British Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) member and chemical expert John Verall was appointed to the government's VPC to represent consumer interests. He recently defied a government gag order, revealing evidence from the study which showed a rise in the rates of breast and prostate cancer in the United States, where two-thirds of all cattle are pumped full of hormones. Of special concern to Verall are the hormones melegestrol acetate, progesterone, testosterone, trenbolone and zeranol. These hormones are known to disrupt the body's natural balance, causing a number of biological effects. 'There is clear evidence of the risk to human health posed by these hormones,' Verall said, citing research that showed oestradiol is considered to be a cancer risk. Studies show that 97 of every 100,000 U.S. women have breast cancer, whereas only 67 of every 100,000 European women are afflicted. Verall added that according to recent studies, children are particularly sensitive to these hormones, which can cause 'sudden growth or breast development, even at levels which are difficult to detect in the laboratory.' Currently, the European Union prohibits the use of growth or sex hormones to speed the maturity of cattle and fatten them up, but there are doubts as to whether the ban has been enforced, because there is no testing for hormone residue in beef imported to the EU. The U.S. government has attempted to have the ban lifted, a move supported by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his administration. ### "
0," Mammograms are so widely used and promoted for breast cancer diagnosis that you would think it is very reliable. That, unfortunately, is far from the truth. False-positives This means mammograms suggest women have cancer when in fact they do not. In a Swedish study published in the British Medical Journal which involved 60,000 women aged 40 to 64, it was revealed that 70 percent of the 726 women referred to oncologists for treatment after mammograms did not actually have cancer. According to an article published in The Lancet in July 1995, of the 5 percent of mammograms which suggested that further testing was necessary, up to 93 percent were actually false-positives. Another article in The Atlantic Monthly in June 1996 revealed that 70 to 80 percent of positive mammograms did not reveal any presence of cancer after biopsy. False-positives lead to many unnecessary biopsies and other invasive surgical procedures, causing needless wastage of money and resources, emotional trauma, financial drain, physical maiming, and loss of breasts. Not accurate with denser breast tissue Women under 40 generally have denser breast tissue, and this lowers the accuracy of mammograms. A study published in Radiology in 1991 estimated that 90 percent of the cases called back for further testing after mammograms could have been due to unclear readings arising from dense overlying breast tissue. False-negatives Partly because of its inability to effectively detect tumors in the presence of denser breast tissue, mammograms also have significant rates of false-negatives. This means that mammograms show 'no cancer' when in fact the women do have the disease, and this shortcoming can prove fatal for many women. Even for women aged 40 to 49, who have less dense breast tissue than younger women, the National Cancer Institute had in 1993 noted a high occurrence of 'missed tumors' - about 40 percent of false-negatives. Affected by ERT Mammography's accuracy is also affected by estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). A study on 8,800 postmenopausal women published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1996 found that ERT use led to a 71 percent higher chance of getting false-positives on mammograms. It also raised the likelihood of false-negatives. Misses small tumors Mammograms also may not detect advanced tumors which are less then 2cm in diameter, when a tumor of about 1cm can already be manually felt via self-examination. With proper training, women can find even smaller tumors. Late detection A diagnostic tool like thermography can actually detect breast cancer tumors years before mammograms can. Being slow to detect breast cancer is problematic because some women, e.g. those below 40, tend to have faster-growing tumors and their conditions could quickly worsen in-between screenings. Conclusion Putting everything together, it is no surprise that some research, including a recent large study which looked at 90,000 Canadian women for 25 years, have found that mammograms did not lower the overall death rate from breast cancer . There are many doctors who feel mammograms are not effective at detecting breast tumors. With its many limitations relating to accuracy and potential harm - its radiation increases breast cancer risk and physical compression of breasts could trigger cancer spread - why are mammograms still so widely used? Numerous experts say this is due to the politics and profits of the industry. Dr. Russell Blaylock, an oncologist, brain surgeon and neuroscientist said that the 'diagnostics are really not that accurate', but 'so much money is being made, and so much money has been invested in these units in hospitals, that no one wants to admit the truth.' 'If I were a woman I'd never have a mammogram ,' he said. Possible screening alternatives include self-examinations and thermograms. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill last week that would have allowed the state's farmers to grow hemp for its oil, seed and fiber for industrial use in the production of food, paper, personal care products, car parts and building materials. AB1147 -- co-authored by Assemblymen Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, and Chuck Devore, R-Irvine -- sought to allow California to join the 30 other countries that allow hemp farming. Currently California state law does not differentiate between hemp crops and marijuana crops, so farmers have been hesitant to grow hemp for fear of having their crops confiscated. Schwarzenegger said in his veto message that although he wants to encourage new state agricultural production, there is no federal law distinguishing between hemp and marijuana. 'Unfortunately, I am very concerned that this bill would give legitimate growers a false sense of security and a belief that production of 'industrial hemp' is somehow a legal activity under federal law,' Schwarzenegger said. AB1147 would have required farmers to submit to crop testing to guarantee that their variety of the cannabis plant was not a hallucinogenic form in return for not having their crops confiscated. Leno said the governor's veto was '...a case of politics sadly trumping science and sound public policy,' and that California family farmers were being denied 'a great cash crop.' John Roulac, founder and president of Nutiva -- a California-based company that sells hemp food products online at www.Nutiva.com -- calls Schwarzenegger's veto 'unfortunate,' but says the fact that the bill passed both houses in California was promising. 'We received so much publicity coverage -- we were in the New York Times, the LA Times, on PBS, CBS -- we educated a lot of people in the process, so that was positive,' Roulac said. 'I think that ultimately the marketplace will trump politics.' Roulac says efforts to legalize hemp have proven effective in North Dakota, where rules for growing industrial hemp have been approved by the governor, and in North Carolina, where legislation was recently passed to study industrial hemp. In response to allegations that industrial hemp could be smoked to produce the same effects as marijuana, Ken Junkert of the North Dakota Department of Agriculture said, 'You'd have to smoke a joint the size of a telephone pole in order to get a headache.' Hemp proponents say the non-psychoactive plant has been misclassified as a Schedule 1 drug, and is vastly different from marijuana plants. For example, marijuana plants grow to 6 feet tall and are planted 4 feet apart, but hemp grows as high as 16 feet tall and is planted mere inches apart for maximum production. The plant is capable of growing in a variety of conditions and does not require herbicides or pesticides, Junkert said. Roulac says the way to reverse the government's stance on the plant is through market demand, since common sense has not prevailed so far. 'Logic and reason are not something that carries the day in Sacramento or Washington, D.C., and building the market for industrial hemp is the most powerful thing that we can do,' Roulac said. Leno says he will continue fighting for legalization on behalf of California farmers, stressing that industrial hemp is a $300 million industry in the United States, but cannot be legally grown here. He says he will try to pass the hemp legalization bill again in January. ### "
0," A nine-year-old Scottish girl, Martha Payne, got some help from her dad to set up her blog ' Never Seconds ,' in which she displayed her school's lunches and created her own content about them. Although the photos of those meals were not flattering, Martha was not decrying her school's food. Instead, her ratings were rather generous. Martha's dad was amazed at the large international following of her blog. It had accrued 2 million hits and she was raised over $3,100 U.S. for a charity called Mary's Meals . Martha had found out about Mary's Meals from her grandfather, who told her it was started locally and spread internationally as a charity to feed needy school children in impoverished areas. Grandpa assured Martha that the charity was efficient and genuine. They used almost all of the funds to feed needy school children. But one day, Martha was called into the school office and told she could no longer photograph and display school lunches in her blog. She was also warned about her comments on school lunch staffers and inspectors from the Argyll and Bute Council . The Argyll and Bute Council is the governing body of Argyll and Bute in Western Scotland, comparable to a USA county containing several communities. Martha's dad informed The Telegraph that the school had been supportive, but the council decided to step in and say no to Martha. What Martha did and what happened Martha wrote a sad goodbye to her blog followers with her lament over not having raised enough money for Mary's Meals to buy a new kitchen in another area targeted for needy school children ( http://neverseconds.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/goodbye.html ). Though she might have been able to continue her blog without the pictures, her goodbye drew outrage from her followers. Tweets on Twitter soon became a 'top-trending' topics in Britain, trending third internationally. Among those tweeting and supporting Martha, whose blog name is Veg, were celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Nick Naim. Even the Scottish Education Minister got into the act, criticizing the Argyll and Bute Council for its 'ridiculous decision.' It seems famous television personality Jamie Oliver has had something to do with improving school meal standards in Britain, which now includes increased veggies and fresh fruit. It also seems that Argyl and Bute schools were lagging behind Britain's improved school lunch fare. To make matters worse for the Argyll and Bute Council , Wired Magazine posted the council's website, email address and Twitter handle on its online article criticizing the council's decision to shut down Martha 'Veg' Payne's site. The outraged response not only forced the council to back down and apologize, but Veg's charity contribution drive swiftly rose from slightly over $3,000 to $35,000. So Veg and her blog are back in business, raising funds for Mary's Meals , and maybe the schools of Argyle and Bute will do something to improve their school lunches. What school food should be Local French school districts actually employ chefs who supervise cooks in-training by using modern kitchens to prepare four and five course freshly prepared meals daily. The foods are fresh from local farms. Menus are constantly changed. Children are allowed to go home for lunch. No vending machines are allowed in the schools. Fresh fruit snacks are offered. Nothing compares to the French standard of school food. "
0," You can eliminate bedbugs from your home without chemicals, using traps that can be built for about a dollar's worth of supplies, say scientists at the University of Florida. 'This concept of trapping works for places where people sleep and need to be protected at those locations,' entomologist Phil Koehler said. In recent years, bedbugs have become a growing problem across the United States, with the blood-sucking insects turning up in cities nationwide. According to an April 2013 survey by the National Pest Management Association, 99.6 percent of all pest management professionals in the country had encountered at least one bedbug infestation in the previous year. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said that most infestations occurred during summer. The association said that summer might be a busy bedbug season because more people are traveling or relocating, and are either bringing bedbugs back into their homes or discovering them in their new location. Although most famous for living in mattresses and bedding, bedbugs can live in nearly any furniture. Their bites are often confused for mosquito bites or rashes, allowing them to go undetected for long periods of time. Traps are cheap, safe and effective Because bedbugs have now become resistant to most pesticides, people often turn to extreme measures to deal with them. But Koehler warns that techniques such as mothballs, bug bombs or pesticide treatment of mattresses are either ineffective or dangerous. In contrast, the traps are an easy way to both determine if your home has bedbugs , and to eliminate them if an infestation is confirmed. Koehler estimates that it would take about an afternoon to make the 50 traps needed to remove bedbugs from a three-bedroom apartment. Compared with the average $3,000 price tag for bedbug extermination in such a space however, the time investment may be well worth it. It can cost $1,200 to eliminate bedbugs even from a small apartment. The traps, made with glue, masking tape and inexpensive plastic containers, present the bedbugs with a rough surface that makes it possible for them to get in, but with a smooth surface inside that makes it impossible for them to get out. They are designed to trap the insects as they move from their daytime hiding places in search of victims to feed on. The simple nature of the traps makes them basically foolproof, Koehler said, and much safer than the alternatives. 'It's really hard to mess this up to the point that you'd hurt anything,' he said. Five easy steps You can find instructions, photos and videos of how to construct the traps on the web site of the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. In essence, however, all that is required is: 1. Cut four pieces of rough-surfaced tape into lengths at least the height of a small plastic container. 2. Press the pieces of tape along the inside of the container, evenly spaced. 3. Wrap more tape around the outside of a larger plastic container, from its base to its upper edge. 4. Glue the smaller container inside the larger one, making sure to leave space between the walls of the containers. 5. (optional) Dust the space between the walls of the containers with baby powder. The bedbugs will be able to climb into the larger container and perhaps even into the smaller one, but will be trapped in the 'moat' between the two containers and unable to escape. The traps should be placed underneath the legs of all furniture in the home, including beds, chairs and sofas. Trapping should continue until no more bedbugs are turning up inside the traps.

Testimonials on Green For Life Here are some testimonials about Green for Life from Amazon.com: Green Smoothies get rid of junk food cravings!!! March 6, 2006 By Rick Josey 'Producer, www.SuperHeartLiving.com' (Newton, NC USA) What a wonderful book! For the past 20 years I've been on a quest to eat more natural foods,and my health improved drastically. But I still suffered from junk food cravings...until I discovered Green for Life! Following Victoria's advice, I added lots of GREENS to my fruit smoothies, and the first day I did so MY FOOD CRAVINGS STOPPED. Bang. Just vanished. Just like my brain's 'cravings switch' was flipped to the OFF position. Apparently my body had been craving minerals all those years, and once I started eating GREENS the cravings stopped. And I'm finally trimming down! Victoria's research in this area is much needed, and much appreciated. I especially love the chapter on the chimpanzees and their daily eating habits. My wife and I participated in one of Victoria's Green for Life teleconferences, and we loved it. She speaks from her heart, is really a nice lady, and this was one of the best conferences ever. We love Victoria! And we sure love the changes that are happening in our bodies! Get this Green for Life book, make yourself some green smoothies, and watch your food cravings vanish. This is the secret to losing weight! :) Thanks, Victoria, for Green for Life! The way to healthy living, October 28, 2007 By M. Caruso I used to do a lot of juicing in the past but it is very time consuming and really messy. My problem is over since I got Green for Life. Making smoothies is a great alternative to juicing. It is much faster, less messy, and you also get some fiber in addition to juice. In addition to great recipes for making smoothies the book is also a good source of information about proper nutrition, the importance of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and much more. Get this book!! Another great volume that you may not miss is Can We Live 150. These two books together make a perfect gift of showing the way to healthy living just for anyone. Simple and cheap way to make a BIG change in your health, October 7, 2008 By Klyde (Yakima, WA USA) Even wild edible plants (weeds) can be used for greens, so it's not just for yuppies. What a great way to get more greens into your diet! I can understand wanting to see more scientific research like another reviewer, but I think the author's theory is strong - based on diet of chimpanzees. Just a few leaves of kale, dandelion, purslane, or spinach for example, some water, and a few fruits to make it sweet and thick; add to your blender. Blend, drink, rinse. Then you're on your way to better health. Easy, cheap, and very filling. Hey, I'd rather just live on frappuccinos and subway sandwiches, but I also want to lower my odds of ending up at the hospital. I've been drinking green smoothies for two months now and I am seeing some good changes - better skin, better moods & energy, weight loss, regular BMs, and I didn't catch my husband's severe cold, for a few. I am convinced Boutenko is on to something big with the idea of green smoothies as a way to sustain some level of raw food intake. Yes, I'm becoming a bit of a groupie. Eating more greens is a diet change anyone can make and it might just give us (speaking as an American) freedom from the debilitating health cycle we seem to be in now: processed food -> degenerative disease -> hospital -> chronic medicine -> worsening health. This book may not have as much scientific data as possible (check out The Live Food Factor by Susan Schenck), and may be heavy on the anecdotes, but it is a very important work. I did not find it to be an ad for the Vitamix blender. She mentions it on 2 pages near the beginning because this blender lasts much longer and blends more smoothly. I used a regular inexpensive blender for several weeks and it worked just fine. (I ended up getting a Vitamix because I can make more things with it). Educated Layperson's Rationale for Green Smoothies + Tasty Recipes, September 9, 2008 By Groovy Vegan (California) Although not a nutrition professional, Victoria Boutenko makes an excellent case for adding green smoothies into one's daily diet. Her strongest arguments include comparing the standard American diet and typical raw foodist diet with the natural chimpanzee diet, as well as dozens of testimonials. There is at least one place, however where she got the facts wrong: On page 95 she says 'chlorophyll provides iron to organs.' In reality, the cholorophyll molecule contains no iron. While similar to the hemogloban molecule, the chlorophyll molecule has a magnesium atom in place of the iron atom. That one error in no way negates the entire book. Most people definitely need more greens and fruit in their diet, and green smoothies are an excellent and tasty way to sneak in these good foods and nutrients. I've tried some of Victoria's smoothies in person when I've heard her speak, and they're always delicious. I always feel better when I drink green smoothies. Her book is quite motivating, and I plan to incorporate them into my diet every day. I encourage people to read the book, get all fired up about green smoothies, make them and drink them every day. :-) Advice for using the recipes: Making a green smoothie is more of an art than a science. Use them as rough guidelines. I noticed the Boutenko recipes often call for about 3 servings of fruit and 2 of vegetables + 1 cup water, so that's what I put in my green smoothie today: 2 small peaches and a large banana + about 5 leaves of dino kale. I added a few mint leaves for flavor. Be sure to taste your smoothie before serving to make sure it's sweet enough to be palatable. (Especially if you taste bitters easily like I do.) Mine needed a bit more sweetening, so I added a couple dates, being sure to take the pit out first. Dates can be very helpful for sweetening, as can extra ripe fruit. "

0," Medicare spends more than a billion dollars every year on a variety of breast cancer screenings, especially mammography. There must be a good medical reason for these tests, right? Not according to researchers at Yale School of Medicine. In a study just published online in JAMA Internal Medicine, the scientists say there is no evidence spending this huge amount of money on breast screening benefits older women at all. The research team, headed by Cary Gross, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center at Yale, assessed overall national costs, as well as variation in costs across geographic regions, of breast screenings in older women, associated work-ups and treatment of any findings. In all, the group studied over 137,000 women on Medicare who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer in prior years. The women were followed for two years so the researchers could learn how they were screened, whether they were diagnosed with breast cancer, and how much the screening and associated treatments cost. Spending more does not increase cancer detection 'Although screening costs varied more than two-fold across geographic regions, there was no evidence that higher expenditures (due to the use of newer, more expensive screening technologies) in the higher-cost areas were benefiting women living in the high-cost regions,' Gross, who is a member of Yale Cancer Center, said in a media statement. 'Specifically, there was no relation between screening expenditures and the detection of advanced cancers.' Amazingly, despite the fact guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force state there's no good evidence that breast cancer screenings have any benefit for women who are age 75 and older, the new research revealed that over $400 million is being spent every year screening Medicare beneficiaries in this very age group. 'In some instances, breast cancer screening can save lives. But no woman wants to undergo testing if it is likely to cause more harm than good, and no health system -- particularly ours -- can afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on screening programs without evidence to support them,' Gross concluded in the media statement. As N aturalNews has previously reported, University of California at San Francisco researchers have also sounded the alarm that unneeded, expensive mammograms are being pushed on elderly women -- specifically those who are incapacitated from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia and likely terminally ill, especially if the women have savings or assets of $100,000 or more. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health , was based on information from Medicare claims. "
0," Flying a commercial plane comes with more risk than meets the eye. According to a new study in JAMA Dermatology, pilots are 2.22 times more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma in their lifetime than those in the general population. Likewise, members of the cabin crew are 2.09 times more likely to come down with the skin cancer. Acute exposure to ultraviolet radiation at high altitudes more than doubles melanoma risk, showing the need for more safety measures to be implemented in the cockpit. The American Cancer Society estimates that melanoma will hit 76,100 Americans this year and take out an estimated 9,710 people. The risk is real for average citizens but is more than twice as high for pilots and airline crew members. Even worse news for pilots is that they are much more likely to die after diagnosis than the general population. Pilots 83 percent more likely do die from melanoma than general population The risk goes unseen and is unheard of, but working 40,000 feet above the ground on a daily basis apparently takes its toll on the skin. Researchers from universities in California and Italy, as well as the FDA, looked at nineteen published studies to investigate the melanoma risk that comes with this career. Assessing data on 266,431 participants, the new study soon found out how much greater the risk was. Not only are pilots at over twice the risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer, but t hey are also 83 percent more likely to die from melanoma than the general population. UVB radiation reflecting into the cockpit from the top and the bottom The authors believe that it's not cosmic radiation or even UVB radiation putting pilots at greater risk for skin cancer. Only about 1 percent of UVB radiation actually penetrates the windshields of aircraft. Likewise, cosmic radiation levels are 'consistently below the allowed dose limit of 20 [millisieverts per year].' The EPA reports that average Americans are exposed to about 3.6 millisieverts per year. The Agency also says that exposure levels of UVB are generally low and aren't a concern. The researchers did assert, however, that UVA radiation can penetrate the glass of the aircraft's windshields, damaging those directly exposed, like pilots. The UVA is more dangerous the higher a plane flies in the air as the rays intensify. Intense UVA can damage DNA, causing mutations to occur in the skin cells. On top of that, a double dose of UVA often hits an airplane, because it can also be reflected from below, especially when planes fly above clouds or through snow-covered mountains. In the study's abstract, the authors conclude, 'Pilots and cabin crew have approximately twice the incidence of melanoma compared with the general population. Further research on mechanisms and optimal occupational protection is needed.' "
0," According to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, loss of coordination and uncontrolled movements associated with Parkinson's disease affect 'one million people in the US and an estimated seven to 10 million worldwide.' Specialists at the University of Rochester speculate that, by 2030, Parkinson's disease could affect twice as many people as it does now. Even as this neural disease grips the elderly, there is hopeful, new evidence emerging that could help patients protect neural cells from dying off and spurring Parkinson's disease. In fact, molecular level evidence has been observed in China. Two Chinese herbal medicines that are well known for toning the kidneys are showing promise for also protecting neural cells in the substantia nigra region of the brain, which is where Parkinson's likes to take hold. Synthetic chemicals wreaking havoc on brain chemistry As synthetic chemicals are ingested, they can store up in the tissues of the human body and manipulate expressions of genes and pathways. With Parkinson's symptoms increasing, it's obvious that the population is being bombarded by cellular manipulating synthetics. As nerve cells die off in the substantia nigra, Parkinson's disease symptoms begin to set in. These physical symptoms show up in elderly people, in their hands and facial expressions. Symptoms include chronic rigidity, impaired coordination, slow movement, and tremors in the hands, legs and face. As neurons progressively die off in the substantia nigra, less dopamine is produced in the brain. Dopamine production, which acts as a chemical messenger controlling coordination and movement, can dwindle, leaving Parkinson's patients with little ability to control movements in their hands, legs and face. As new studies come out on the neurotoxic effects of chemical compounds like PCBs, professionals are beginning to make connections between environmental neurotoxins and cognitive decline in the elderly. As the brain's neuron pathways are manipulated by environmental pollutants like PCBs and aspartame, it's becoming clear how synthetic chemicals can destroy the cognitive abilities of people as they age. Aspartame, which excites neuron cells to death, could have a role in destroying brain function as people age. PCBs, which were banned decades ago, continue to show up in people's tissue samples today. Both chemicals affect expressions in the brain. Two Chinese medicines can protect vulnerable neuron cell deaths In a time when people are assaulted worldwide by environmental pollutants, there are positives. One study shows how two herbal Chinese medicines help protect the brain from neuron death. This study, published in the Neural Regeneration Research , reports that kidney-toning Chinese medicines , such as Herba Epimedii ( Epimedium leaf) and Herba Cistanches (desert-living Cistanche ) have the ability to protect nerve cells by regulating expressions of neurotrophic and apoptosis related factors. In the study, four groups of Wistar rats were treated in the gastrointestinal tract with three Chinese herbal medicines and a control of distilled water. The herbal medicines included were cistanche, epimedium and dodder seed. A set amount of each medicine was given to cultured neural MES23.5 cells for 24-hour periods on 14 consecutive days. After each 24-hour treatment, the neural cells were incubated in a hydrogen peroxide solution for three hours as they were exposed to damage. The results showed that each herbal medicine improved the survival rate of hydrogen peroxide-injured MES 23.5 cells. The medicines also inhibited cell death expression of FasL and caspase-3 and stopped apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. The results of the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay were also promising. Herba Cistanches and Herba Epimedii treatments increased expressions of nerve growth and brain-derived neurotrophic factors. In injured MES23.5 cells, the two kidney-toning medicines increased expressions of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors. In short, two of the herbal medicines studied not only tone the kidneys but can regulate the expression of DNA in nerve cells, halting cell death associated with Parkinson's disease. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) showed a special interest in and appreciation for homeopathic medicine. In 1854, before Lincoln was elected president, he was retained as a lawyer to prepare a state legislative proposal to charter a homeopathic medical college in Chicago. Because Chicago was the home of the American Medical Association, which had been founded in 1847 in part to stop the growth of homeopathy, Lincoln's job was no simple effort. However, many of Chicago's most prominent citizens and politicians participated on the board of trustees of the proposed Hahnemann Medical College, including Chicago's mayor, two congressmen, an Illinois state representative, a Chicago city councilman, the co-founder of Northwestern University, the founder of Chicago Union Railroad, and several medical doctors who were homeopaths (Spiegel and Kavaler, 2002). Despite significant opposition, Lincoln was successful in obtaining a charter for the homeopathic college. Today, the Pearson Museum at Southern Illinois University has an exhibit of a nineteenth-century doctor's office and drug store; included in this exhibit is a homeopathic medicine kit from the Diller Drug Store of Springfield, Illinois. The exhibit notes that Abraham Lincoln was a frequent customer of the drug store and a regular user of homeopathic medicines (Karst, 1988, 11). Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, especially his most trusted advisor and Secretary of State, William Steward. Ultimately, the story of what happened to William Seward is a classic story in medical history that exemplifies conventional medicine's attitude toward and actions against unconventional medical treatments and the physicians who provide them. On the night Lincoln was assassinated, Seward was stabbed in the multi-person assassination plot against the Union. Thanks to the medical care provided by Joseph K. Barnes, MD, U.S. Surgeon General, Seward survived. However, because Seward's personal physician was a homeopathic doctor and because the AMA had a policy that it was an ethical violation to consult with a homeopathic doctor or even provide care for a homeopathic patient, Dr. Barnes was denounced by the vice president of the AMA for providing medical care (Haller, 2005, 192). In addition to choosing Seward to be his secretary of state, several leading advisors were homeopathic advocates. On November 1, 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George Brinton McClellan (1826-1885) to command the Union army during the Civil War. However, in late December McClellan contracted typhoid fever, which left him unable to go to his office to conduct business (Rafuse, 1997). During the first week of McClellan's illness, two homeopathic doctors arrived from New York to care for the ill general and his father-in-law and chief of staff, Randolph B. Marcy, who was also ill. McClellan's decision to employ homeopathic doctors is particularly interesting considering the fact that the general came from a family of prominent conventional physicians. Despite this serious illness, General McClellan remained active, giving regular orders to his subordinates, arranging for troop movement and supply transport, meeting with the president on a weekly basis, issuing court martial orders, and even providing commendations to officers. By January 2, he seemed to be much better and shortly afterwards he had no noticeable physical limitations. McClellan lived another twenty-three years. Despite the success of this homeopathic treatment on the military leader of the Union army, that very month, January 1862, the Army Medical Board rejected requests by homeopathic doctors to serve in military hospitals, arguing that to grant this request would invite applications from all types of quacks and charlatans claiming medical expertise. Typhoid fever caused more deaths during the Civil War and the Spanish-American War than the deaths caused by bullets (Wershub, 1967, 175). Despite the fact that homeopathy gained widespread popularity in the United States and Europe due to its successes in treating various infectious disease epidemics of the mid- and late-1800s, including typhoid epidemics (Bradford, 1900; Coulter, 1973), the antagonism against homeopathy and homeopaths led to government regulations stipulating that graduates of homeopathic medical colleges could not receive a commission for military service. In Connecticut, several 'irregular' physicians offered their services to the governor, who accepted them, but the examining board of the Union army rejected them and instead accepted recruits from a hastily graduated class from Yale College. Although the Union army had strict restrictions against homeopathic physicians, the Confederate army did not. In fact, the physician to the wife of the Confederate army's General Robert E. Lee was a homeopathic doctor, Alfred Hughes, MD (Hughes, 1904, 39). At least in one incidence, General Lee himself was known to have taken homeopathic medicines (Mainwaring and Riley, 2005). Thankfully, the antagonism toward homeopaths was not as severe during World War I; almost 2,000 homeopathic physicians were commissioned as medical officers. Even the American Red Cross authorized a homeopathic hospital unit (Dearborn, 1923). Lincoln was also known to appoint some homeopathic physicians to political positions. For instance, in 1863 he appointed Dr. J. G. Hunt, author of a book on homeopathy and surgery (Hill and Hunt, 1855), to be consul to Nicaragua (King, 1905, I, 177). Lincoln also signed a bill into law that gave the president the authority to make appointments to the Union army's medical department, including homeopaths (Haller, 2005, 187). However, orthodox physicians strongly asserted that they would not work with homeopaths in any way, thus creating new and more difficult problems in military medicine. Although Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, that didn't protect the medical science from his famous wit. He once called homeopathy 'medicine of a shadow of a pigeon's wing.' On a more serious note, it should also be mentioned that the personal physician to Mary Lincoln (1818-1882) during the later part of her life was a homeopathic physician and surgeon from Chicago, Dr. Willis Danforth. Mary Lincoln was known to have experienced serious bouts of depression after her husband was assassinated and two of her children died, one at age 11 (1862) and the other at 18 (1871). Mary Lincoln became the sole heir of the Lincoln estate and her extravagant spending and unusual behavior later in life concerned her son Robert so much that in 1874, he sought to get her declared insane and sent to a mental asylum. The testimony of her homeopath, Danforth, confirmed her insanity because he noted that Mrs. Lincoln experienced 'nervous derangement' and had delusions. She was committed to the asylum, but was free to move about the grounds, and was released three months later. Recent research has uncovered strong evidence to suggest that Mary Lincoln also suffered from syphilis, which may help explain her crazed mental state (Hayden, 2003, 120-132).

0," I trained as a pediatric intern at Bellevue NYU and then in Rehab medicine. I quickly was offered the directorship of the pediatric emergency room at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago. (Story by Dr. Toni Bark, republished from HealthImpactNews.com ) While I had initially been furious if parents came in and were not up to date on their children's vaccines, this attitude changed. And changed drastically. I began to see patterns. Children who were seen in the vaccine clinic would then come to our ER with seizures, respiratory arrest and asthma attacks. I began to realize, not all children respond well to vaccination and in fact, some die. It wasn't until my masters program in disaster management at BU, which I began in 2010 and finished in 2012, did I begin to see the fraudulent nature of how vaccines are being marketed and the corruption in the advisory committees. I had not even been made aware of the federal vaccine court. I had no idea vaccine recipients who were damaged or killed from vaccines had zero recourse with the manufacturer or physician. Vaccine manufacturers enjoy full immunity from law suits of any kind, including defective design (as opined by Scalia in Feb 2011) as they are legally listed as 'unavoidably unsafe'. The vaccine court is almost a secret. They have paid out 3 billion dollars since it's inception in 1986. The vaccine adverse events reporting system is also not well advertised and the government admits it probably only receives 10 percent of the adverse events which occur. We mandate more vaccines than any other country. We also have the worst infant mortality rate of any first, second, and even some third world countries. I am 55, so I only received a handful of vaccines. Today, infants receive 14 different vaccines by age of 1 and by age 18, that number is 58 and in some states with flu vaccine mandates, that number is much higher. A note on the flu vaccine mandates. New Jersey and Connecticut were the first states to mandate flu vaccine for all preschoolers and school age children, annually. This has done nothing to reduce flu cases in their states. In fact, both states are in the highest grouping for flu every year. While most people do just fine with vaccination, a small percentage do not. And I mean, really do not. Vaccination product inserts describe encephalitis as a possible outcome along with guillan barre paralysis. Most parents or doctors (for that matter) do not start out 'anti-vaccine', their stance is changed once they have a child who is permanently and profoundly damaged by a vaccine. They then decide no more for that child and no more for their next children. And they are correct in making that decision. Genetics, epigenetics and timing can have a great influence on vaccine adverse events. No one drug at one dose is right for everyone and to assume it is, is foolishness. It is evident from numerous federal cases against many pharmaceutical companies, drug study data is hidden, manipulated and even manufactured. Why is this hard to believe when it comes to vaccine studies? While I wrote for my masters, I uncovered serious issues with vaccine trials, safety, being one of them. All vaccine safety studies are using false placebos to compare adverse events. The HPV vaccine (which is no longer governmentally recommended in Japan, France and Israel due to serious reactions including deaths) used the new aluminum adjuvant as the placebo. The Prevner safety study, used an experimental meningitis C vaccine. All the independent Cochrane meta-analysis on vaccine studies end the same way: safety studies are needed in order to assess risk/benefit ratios. There are over 200 new vaccines in the pipeline and as those before them, they will all be approved and recommended which will turn to mandates. When is enough, enough? After Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg laws were changed to forbid forced medical procedures. The Helsinki accord is very clear; all patients have the right to informed consent prior to medical procedures. There is no informed consent for vaccination as it is, we really should not be moving backwards. I am more than willing to send you any studies, to speak to you, or even to fly out and give a presentation. Watch the Movie Bought for FREE for a limited time.

0," The pretty pink ribbons are coming undone as more people start to see through the 'breast cancer awareness' racket and waste. Yes, the Susan G. Komen Foundation has brought awareness to breast cancer, but they have not shined a light on the real-life solutions that exist for cancer patients. In fact, the organization often steers breast cancer patients away from the very therapies that work, stereotyping anything outside their sponsored advice as a 'complimentary therapy' scam. Interestingly, cancer patients are being cured using 'complimentary therapies,' despite the medical system's attempt to silence and suppress them. Cancer patients are actually leaving the US medical system altogether, turning down chemotherapy, mastectomy and radiation, and finding answers not sponsored by the pink-washing Susan Komen Foundation. The foundation is directing patients toward immune system suppression, drug-chemical treatment and the maiming of body parts, while shunning several therapies that assist the body's natural ability to heal. Their site says, 'No complementary therapy can cure cancer. If a complementary therapy makes this type of claim, it is a sign that it is a scam' and may 'interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.' A brainwashing pyramid scheme Most people involved in the pink campaign are kind and generous but aren't truly aware of how much waste and propaganda is involved in the breast cancer awareness racket. After reviewing what the foundation supports and how they are funded, it appears as if the entire pink-washing movement is just a front for the cancer industry in the US, which makes people think that cures are nonexistent but just around the corner, as long as you donate a little more money and wear a little more pink. The foundation is driven by catchy marketing and feeds itself energy by promoting itself and its color branding. Meanwhile, this machine encourages patients to succumb to chemical treatments that destroy their own cellular energy production. The whole foundation appears to be about giving and saving lives, but is the money really going into the pockets of breast cancer patients and empowering them with unbiased education on cancer treatment? Much of the money donated to the Foundation either goes toward marketing, to pharmaceutical research or to pad the pockets of its executives. At its core, the Foundation is really just a pyramid scheme, funneling the generous donations of kind people to a tier of executives. According to Charity Navigator, the Foundation spent $18,394,170 in 2013 on administration expenses alone, allotting $560,896 to Founder and CEO Nancy Brinker and $606,461 to President Elizabeth Thompson. Cancer patients are being cured without undergoing the system's standard of chemotherapy, radiation and mastectomy Patients and generous donors are being misled in the mind. While the US is painted pink, from coast to coast, cancer is being cured clinically in Mexico. One place that specializes in assisting the body's natural ability to heal is The Northern Baja Healing Center. Dr. Patrick Vickers, who studied the Gerson therapy directly under Charlotte Gerson in the '90s, applies principles that empower cancer patients' immune systems, maximizing energy production at the cellular level. The passionate Dr. Vickers has studied the handwritten files of Dr. Gerson, dating from 1910 to 1959 and now implements the detoxification and energy-maximizing protocols, expanding the work of one of the greatest medical geniuses in history. Dr. Vickers understands what acidity really represents in the body -- the buildup of hydrogen which ultimately repels the oxygen needed to convert sugar into energy in the mitochondria. He understands the problems with under-utilization of oxygen in the Krebs cycle and can recognize anaerobic glycolysis -- where the final breakdown of sugar ends up as lactic acid. It's lactic acid that feeds cancer cells. To stop feeding the cancer, Dr. Patrick Vickers gives his patients the necessary nutrients from a clean, strict whole-foods protocol which helps their cells' mitochondria utilize sugars and oxygen for optimal energy production. Patients receive up to 5,000 calories per day through clean fruits and vegetables. He uses stomach, pancreatic and intestinal enzymes to boost patients' metabolism for the efficient breakdown of food into energy. He uses organic coffee enemas and a Hippocrates soup to detoxify the liver. He uses a potassium compound powder in patients to eliminate the sodium and water pent up in the cells which restricts efficient mitochondrial function. He also uses vitamin C IVs, Coley's therapy, dendritic cell therapy and more. This is only the beginning: learn more here. Dr. Vickers reports that 70 to 80 percent of patients who end up at his doorstep have 'run the entire gamut' of conventional treatments. 'If the Gerson therapy was the portal of entry therapy for every single person diagnosed with cancer, right from the beginning, the cancer cure rates would go through the roof,' says Dr. Vickers. Click here for a full list of diseases successfully treated using the Gerson therapy. So why aren't women being educated about the Gerson therapy from the start? Is the Susan G. Komen Foundation telling the whole truth about breast cancer? "
0," In the wake of revelations - thanks in every way to the alternative media - that the Department of Homeland Security had planned to purchase and stockpile as much as 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition, a pair of U.S. lawmakers are proposing legislation that would prevent all government agencies from storing vast amounts of ammo. Sens. Jim Inhofe, and Rep. Frank Lucas, both Oklahoma Republicans, have introduced in their respective chambers the Ammunition Management for More Obtainability (AMMO) Act of 2013. The bill, according to a statement from Sen. Inhofe, would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a report on the purchasing of ammunition by federal agencies, except the Department of Defense , and its effect on the supply of ammunition available to the public. The act would also restrict government agencies from obtaining additional ammunition for a six-month period if the agency's current ammo stockpiles are 'higher than its monthly averages prior to the Obama Administration.' 'President Obama has been adamant about curbing law-abiding Americans' access and opportunities to exercise their Second Amendment rights,' said Inhofe. 'One way the Obama Administration is able to do this is by limiting what's available in the market with federal agencies purchasing unnecessary stockpiles of ammunition.' 'I was surprised' Continuing, Inhofe said: As the public learned in a House committee hearing this week, the Department of Homeland Security has two years worth of ammo on hand and allots nearly 1,000 more rounds of ammunition for DHS officers than is used on average by our Army officers. The AMMO Act of 2013 will enforce transparency and accountability of federal agencies' ammunition supply while also protecting law-abiding citizens access to these resources. Lucas said his interest in the issue was piqued after constituents reported that there were shortages of ammunition in his home state, and 'the Department of Homeland Security 's profligate purchases of ammunition.' 'We have introduced the AMMO Act of 2013 to curtail these purchases so Americans can exercise their Second Amendment rights without being encumbered by the federal government,' Lucas said. 'I was surprised to find out the DHS has the right to buy up to 750 million rounds of ammunition over the next five years, while it already has two years worth of ammo already. This is an issue that must be addressed, and I am pleased this legislation provides us the opportunity to do so.' DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano has vacillated between denying her office was buying so much ammo to questioning the motive of those who reported the purchases and questioned her and the department about them. Taking such massive purchases seriously A year ago, selfnews editor and founder Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported on the first of what would become a series of massive ammo purchases by DHS. As he tracked the story for months, DHS was at first silent about the purchases, then denied they were occurring, despite the federal purchase orders posted online. Anyone who reported the purchases was branded a 'conspiracy theorist.' Fast forward to this month, and DHS is signing a completely different tune. Now, we are told, the purchases are just good business; buying in bulk, you see, saves the taxpayer money. Call this the 'Sams Club' excuse. An important point about this 'buy-in-bulk-to-save-money' BS. Napolitano says her agency is supplying nearly 100,000 armed agents and they use the ammo for practice. Only, the bulk of these purchases involves expensive hollow point ammunition . Seasoned shooters will tell you that you don't 'target practice' with hollow point ammunition. There's no telling at this point if the Inhofe-Lucas legislation will pass, but it's an important piece of this government ammo purchase puzzle in that at least some lawmakers are taking it seriously.

0," Sticking more closely to a Mediterranean diet may lead to a longer life, according to a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine . The researchers say that the study is the first to examine a connection between the diet and mortality in a U.S. population. Researchers examined data on more than 160,000 women and 200,000 men who had filled out detailed questionnaires about their eating habits, weight, age, smoking status and other factors known to affect health. The researchers then ranked participants based on how closely they held to either a traditional Mediterranean diet or an alternate Mediterranean diet. Participants scored higher for adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet if they ate more fruits and nuts, grains, beans, fish and vegetables (excluding potatoes), and if they ate less dairy, meat or saturated fat. Those who drank a moderate amount of alcohol, defined as five to 25 grams per day for women and 10 to 50 grams per day for men, also scored higher. The alternative Mediterranean diet was scored similarly, but included only whole (not refined) grains, did not include dairy products, counted fruits and nuts separately, used the same alcohol standard for men and women, and deducted points for meat only if it was red or processed. The people who stuck most closely to either Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely to die during the first five years after the surveys were taken. Among women who followed the alternate Mediterranean diet most closely, mortality was reduced by 22 percent, with mortality form heart disease 21 percent lower and deaths from cancer lowered by 14 percent. The numbers for men were similar. The association between the Mediterranean diet and decreased mortality seemed strongest among smokers, particularly smokers who were of healthy body weight. Among both smokers and non-smokers, those who were obese did not appear to have their lives lengthened by the Mediterranean diet. "
0," Sometimes the best way to tell a story is to let the mainstream media journalists demonstrate what complete morons they truly are. No better example of this exists than the recent airing of Asiana Flight 214 pilot names by a Fox News affiliate KTVU of the San Francisco Bay area. On live television, a Fox newscaster proudly announced they had discovered the names of the pilots and confirmed them with the NTSB. They pilots names were reported as: Sum Ting Wong Wi Tu Lo Ho Lee Fuk Bang Ding Ow Watch the video yourself (below) to hear a journalist mindlessly read these names without even realizing how she was being completely punked. For the record, we here at selfnews express great sorrow for the lives lost in this tragedy, and do not demean them in any way by covering this story. This is about the idiocy of the media in being so easily punked in their reporting about the crash. Mainstream media IQs plummeting faster than broken airplanes The fact that a mainstream TV journalist can be so easily punked brings up all sorts of interesting questions. For example: why are mainstream media teleprompter readers suffering from IQs that are plummeting faster than a crashing jetliner? For starters, you have to be incredibly stupid not to realize these names are a total joke as you're reading them aloud . How can you read, out loud, 'Sum Ting Wong' and not realize these are Bart Simpson-style name jokes? And then there's the deeper question of why a Bay-area journalist wouldn't also immediately recognize these names sound more like Cantonese names, not Korean. Common Korean names sound more like 'Kim Jun Woo,' not 'Ho Lee Fuk.' But alas, these TV journalists have probably never left the USA and so are utterly clueless about global culture. What did we expect? But my favorite part about all this is that this reporter just mindlessly reads anything that appears on the teleprompter. Watch the video for yourself: Hey, helmet head: Is that hair real? It's worth noting, however, that if all of Flight 214 passengers had been wearing the grand helmet of impenetrable hair that this Fox news reporter wears on the set, they would have all been well protected from head injuries. There's nothing more pukishly politically correct than a head of hair that just screams, 'I'M NOT CONTROVERSIAL!' It actually looks like the redhead equivalent of a Darth Vader helmet, minus the breathing apparatus. Eventually realizing it had been punked, channel 2 news issued a 14-second apology in which it claimed an 'NTSB official' had confirmed the names! Here's the apology video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFDwgJa7JOI So apparently if the NTSB told this TV news crew that the airplane was also levitated by magic, and somehow 'the magic broke,' they would report that, too. This just demonstrates the mindless subservience to government that's routinely practiced in the mainstream media . It also goes to show you how loosely this term 'official' is being thrown around. It turns out this 'official' was actually an NTSB intern who was having a little too much fun with the mainstream media. We don't know the name of this intern, but we salute him and his remarkable news making genius in allowing the mainstream media to demonstrate what a bunch of buffoons they truly are. selfnews grants the coveted ' Sum Ting Wong ' award to this anonymous intern in the hopes that his leadership and innovation may inspire countless others to mess with the media and get them to read, on air, names like 'Ho Lee Fuk.' Because for just one moment, all the viewers couldn't help but see what a total farce the mainstream media has truly become. "
0," Tweet A derivative of the sweet wormwood plant used since ancient times to fight malaria and shown to precisely target and kill cancer cells may someday aid in stopping breast cancer before it gets a toehold. In a new study, two University of Washington bioengineers found that the substance, artemisinin, appeared to prevent the onset of breast cancer in rats that had been given a cancer-causing agent. The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Cancer Letters. Based on earlier studies, artemisinin is selectively toxic to cancer cells and is effective orally, according to Henry Lai, research professor in the Department of Bioengineering, who conducted the study with fellow UW bioengineer Narendra P. Singh, a research associate professor in the department. With the results of this study, its an attractive candidate for cancer prevention. The properties that make artemisinin an effective antimalarial agent also appear responsible for its anti-cancer clout. When artemisinin comes into contact with iron, a chemical reaction ensues that spawns free radicals highly reactive chemicals that, when formed inside a cell, attack the cell membrane and other structures, killing the cell. The malaria parasite cant eliminate iron in the blood cells it eats, and stores it. Artemisinin makes that stored iron toxic to the parasite. The same appears to be true for cancer. Because they multiply so rapidly, most cancer cells have a high rate of iron uptake. Their surfaces have large numbers of receptors, which transport iron into the cells. That appears to allow the artemisinin to selectively target and kill the cancer cells, based on their higher iron content. In the latest study, the researchers administered to rats a single oral dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, a substance known to induce multiple breast tumors. Half of the rats then were fed regular food, while the other half were fed food with 0.02 percent artemisinin added. For 40 weeks, researchers monitored each group for the formation of breast tumors. Among the rats that didnt get artemisinin, 96 percent developed tumors. In comparison, 57 percent of the artemisinin-fed rats developed tumors. In addition, the researchers report, tumors that did develop in the artemisinin-fed rats were both significantly fewer and smaller in size when compared with controls. The reason for artemisinins apparent preventative effect may be twofold, the researchers said. The substance may kill precancerous cells, which also tend to use more iron than ordinary cells, before those cells develop into a tumor. Artemisinin also may impede angiogenesis, or a tumors ability to grow networks of blood vessels that allow it to enlarge. Because artemisinin is widely used in Asia and Africa as an anti-malarial, it has a track record of being relatively safe and causing no known side effects, Lai said. The present data indicate that it may be a potent cancer-chemoprevention agent. Additional studies are needed to investigate whether the breast cancer prevention property of artemisinin can be generalized to other types of cancer. Chongqing Holley Holdings, a Chinese company, and Holley Pharmaceuticals, its U.S. subsidiary, supported the research. The company, located in Chongqing, China, has been in the artemisinin business for more than 30 years and is a world leader in farming, extracting and manufacturing artemisinin, its derivatives and artemisinin-based anti-malaria drugs.

0," Tweet It's true: cocoa can prevent and reverse cancer. That's because it's loaded with powerful phytochemicals found naturally in the cacao plant -- the source of cocoa and just one of many Amazon herbs. But in the real world, people will take this information and misuse it: they'll stuff down chocolate bars loaded with refined sugars, and they'll tell themselves that it's good for them! In reality, cocoa is a powerful medicinal herb, but almost nobody in America has ever tasted cocoa by itself. In America and most western societies, cocoa is always consumed with massive quantities of sugar and other food additives. The result? It's probably worse for you than eating nothing at all. If you really want the benefits of cocoa (and, yes, the anti-cancer benefits are real), you'll have to find chocolate bars made with pure cocoa, and made without any sugars or artificial sweeteners. You can also buy nutritional supplements containing theobromine cacao (cocoa). "
0," To hear the multitude of anti-Second Amendment types in the Obama Administration and scattered throughout out the federal law enforcement community, Joe and Jane American don't need a military look-alike, semi-automatic rifle . But apparently it's okay if agents of the Internal Revenue Service have them because, you know, U.S. taxpayers, as a group, are inherently dangerous and violent (insert sarcasm here). No one at the IRS has yet to offer a credible explanation as to why its code enforcement agents must be equipped with, and proficient in, the use of the AR-15 assault rifle (yes, 'assault rifle,' because the government's AR-15s are fully automatic). But they are training with them nonetheless, and that has a few members of Congress scratching their heads. One of them is Rep. Jeff Duncan, (R-SC). He is on a mission to find out the justification for IRS enforcement agents being equipped with high-power assault rifles (especially now that, under provisions of Obamacare, the IRS will become the chief enforcement agency for the individual mandate - the section which requires you to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty ). 'Are Americans that much of a target?' Duncan, who is chairman of the House subcommittee responsible for oversight of homeland security, told Politico that while touring a federal law enforcement facility in late May, he noticed that some agents there were training with AR-15 rifles at a firing range. The agents, he said, identified themselves as IRS . 'When I left there, it's been bugging me for weeks now, why IRS agents are training with a semi-automatic rifle AR-15, which has stand-off capability,' Duncan told the news site. 'Are Americans that much of a target that you need that kind of capability?' The answer, of course, is no . I don't know about you, but I can't remember the last time a taxpayer walled himself up in his home and opened fire on visiting IRS agents . Maybe I missed all of those cases somehow. Duncan says he gets it that the IRS has an enforcement division. But what he's asking is why such a high level of firepower is needed or even appropriate, considering that IRS agents could coordinate any potentially dangerous operations with other federal law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI - especially in a time of tight budgets. 'I think Americans raise eyebrows when you tell them that IRS agents are training with a type of weapon that has stand-off capability. It's not like they're carrying a sidearm and they knock on someone's door and say, 'You're evading your taxes',' Duncan told Politico . The South Carolina congressman says he's going to try to find out what gives, especially given the recent scrutiny of the IRS' politically motivated targeting of conservative, patriot-minded and Tea Party organizations. 'We'll ask the questions and hopefully they can justify it,' he said. 'And if not, we'll bring them in front of the committee for a hearing and ask the questions on the record.' 'Training on assigned weapons' When contacted by Politico , someone from the public affairs division issued a standard, sanitized 'explanation' justifying the need for the additional firepower. 'As law enforcement officials, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents are equipped similarly to other federal, state and local law enforcement organizations,' the statement said. 'Special Agents receive training on the appropriate and safe use of assigned weapons. IRS Criminal Investigation has internal controls and oversight in place to ensure all law enforcement tools, including weapons are used appropriately.' Yes, yes. Of course they do. But again, the question was, Why do your agents need to be 'assigned' AR-15s ? The IRS has yet to explain it to the public. Let's hope Duncan and his panel can get some real answers. "
0," When the upswing in commodity prices eventually makes its way throughout the food system in mid-to-late 2011, food prices are sure to spike with levels potentially reaching those of 2008, announced U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) economist Ephraim Leibtag at the agency's annual Outlook Forum. And if conditions escalate rapidly, there is also the potential for food riots and other civil unrest. The USDA is predicting a 3.5 percent increase in food prices in 2011, which is about twice the overall inflation rate but less than the 2008 increase, according to a recent Reuters report. In 2008, food prices rose 5.5 percent, which represents the highest increase since 1990. But the possibility of food prices dramatically rising in 2011 like they did in 2008 is a definite possibility. 'Given that it's still earlier in the year, I'm prone to be conservative on the side of the forecast,' said Leibtag. 'It's a possibility,' he added, concerning the likelihood of massive inflation in food costs like was seen in 2008. Leibtag also explained the agency's expectation of a four percent rise in costs for meats, poultry, and fish; a 3.5 percent increase for fruits and vegetables; a four percent increase for cereals and bakery products; and a three percent increase in sugar and sweets costs. All increases represent anywhere from a 20 to 60 percent increase over last year's increases. In 2008, food shortages and rapid price increases led to riots in 25 different countries around the world. And the same may happen again, including even in the US, due to factors like the devaluation of the dollar, crop losses, rising oil costs, and other economic factors ( http://www.selfnews.com/031408_food_price... ). The warning serves as a wake-up call to Americans to take back their land and begin growing more food on the local and regional scale. According to statistics from Farm Aid, a family farming advocacy group, roughly five million US farms have been lost since the 1930s, and about 330 farmers every week leave their land. If this trend continues, the situation will only worsen. Factory farming operations have essentially replaced local farming throughout the country. And government policies like subsidization of genetically-modified (GM) crops only continues to drive small-scale farmers off their land and exacerbate the problem.

0," There seems to be no limit to the violations of natural law that will be committed in the name of 'science.' The latest is an effort to make cows produce human breast milk by using genetically modified embryos crossed with human genes, then implanted into surrogate cows. The result is a cow that produces milk containing a human protein called lysozyme, making it closer to the nutritional composition of human breast milk. Efforts are under way to use the same genetic engineering of cows to produce human-like milk with higher fat content, lactoferrin and alpha-lactalbumin as well. Yet another 'scientific' crime against nature That such an experiment is even going on, of course, is sick at so many levels . It is a crime against nature being committed solely for corporate greed. Look where this is headed: These genetically modified cows will be produced en masse , then held in what are basically dairy concentration camps so that they can produce milk that some wealthy, powerful corporation will then market to American consumers as a 'breast milk replacement.' Mothers will be told all sorts of lies about it, such as, 'Oh, you don't need to breastfeed your babies anymore. You can just buy this cow/human GMO breast milk! It's exactly the same!' Of course, the mad scientists pushing this scheme will claim it's a way for women who can't produce breast milk to buy a source of human-like milk for their babies. But that's nonsense: We already have a whole species of HUMAN WOMEN who can produce breast milk and who are trying to offer it for sale online but are being threatened and shut down by health authorities. The government, you see, doesn't want women to be able to sell their own breast milk to other women whose children might need it. No, they want you to buy it from a corporation running a factory dairy operation using genetically modified cows . Because that's more 'scientific' somehow. It all makes no sense, of course. Why genetically engineer cows with human genes when we already have humans with human genes who can create PERFECT human breast milk right now? Corporate greed in the name of science knows no bounds As with nearly everything being done in the name of science these days, this is really just a case of runaway corporate greed ; not respect, humility or even a sense of compassion for humans and animals. In the name of 'science,' these poor genetically engineered cows won't even be able to produce cow milk for their own babies! They will be freaks of nature that are completely out of balance with their own species. The Chinese scientist who carried out this crime against nature, by the way, thinks it's a great idea, saying 'The modified bovine milk is a possible substitute for human milk. It fulfilled the conception of humanizing the bovine milk.' ( http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/03/sc... ) Did you catch that phrase? 'Humanizing bovine milk.' But hey, why even bother? Bovine milk is food for baby cows , and yet the milk industry has somehow convinced human adults that they need to keep consuming this baby cow beverage. Just the fact that so many human beings keep drinking pasteurized, homogenized, processed cow's milk through their entire life is utterly bizarre to begin with. Now with their genetic engineering of dairy cattle, what slogan will they come up with next? 'This milk is NEARLY HUMAN!' OMG, rush out and buy some! It's nearly human! Can I drink some, too? Because what's ultimately obvious from all this is that the real animals in all this are the mad scientists who keep playing God with genetic code. They're smug and arrogant in their 'success' of creating cow's milk that's almost human, not realizing that God and Mother Nature already created the perfect nutritional beverage for human babies hundreds of thousands of years ago , with NO science, no patents, no FDA, no technology and no corporations whatsoever. It's called human breast milk and there is no substitute. Besides, genetically engineering a cow to produce human-like breast milk isn't much of an achievement. A far greater challenge would be genetically engineering a pig to be a moronic and short-sighted as modern-day GMO scientists. I'm not even sure that's possible.

0," Nut milks are extremely popular among health-conscious consumers, but the mass-produced nut milks sold at the store all suffer from two critical problems in their ingredients: carrageenan and calcium carbonate. Carrageenan is a thickening agent that's increasingly concerning to many consumers. Although I personally don't find it irritating, some people say consuming it leads to bowel irritation or digestion discomfort. To me, however, the far greater problem in commercial nut milks is the added calcium carbonate . Nearly all nut milk makers add this ingredient -- essentially powdered limestone -- to their products in order to increase the calcium content to compete with cow's milk. This is why you see label claims such as 'high in calcium!' on commercial nut milk products. What's the problem with calcium carbonate? It's inorganic calcium , and in my opinion you should never drink powdered rocks . Yes, your body needs calcium, but it needs to be from plant sources where the calcium has been enhanced into a bioavailable, organic form. I strongly suspect this is why people who consume very large quantities of commercial nut milks made with calcium carbonate can sometimes experience extreme bone and joint pain . The calcium carbonate causes 'calcification' of the body, and this process can include calcification of arteries and kidneys as well. While a little calcium carbonate won't hurt you, if you're consuming it in large quantities on a daily basis, it can overload your system and lead to real problems. Real nut milk shouldn't be made with powdered rocks The simple truth of all this is that nut milks shouldn't be made with powdered rocks to begin with. It's absurd, actually, to think that you need to add limestone to nut milk. And although I've been a strong advocate of nut milks over the years, I cannot recommend any nut milk made with calcium carbonate. The solution to all this? Make your own nut milks! Suddenly it's EASY to make your own nut milks For years, I made almond milk the hard way: I soaked the almonds, blended them in a Vita-Mix, then used a nut milk bag to squeeze out the almond milk. It was a tedious process, but it produced really delicious and highly nutritious almond milk. Now, there's a far easier way to accomplish the same thing , and it's all due to a breakthrough appliance that probably has the most ridiculous sounding name ever: ' SoyaPower G4 .' And no, it has nothing to do with cell phone signals. The name is just a hodge-podge of randomness. As you probably guessed, the 'SoyaPower G4' was created to give people an easy way to make soy milk. Soy milk is extremely popular in China and Taiwan, you see, and the making of soy milk is a very common activity there. It turns out that the SoyaPower machine is also incredibly good at making almond milk, hemp milk, quinoa milk, oat milk, rice milk and almost any other nut milk or grain milk you can think of. The process is ridiculously easy: Dump the pre-soaked nuts and water into the device and press the appropriate button on the control panel. The device does the blending in minutes to make raw almond milk . (You can also make heated nut milks such as soy milk, which must be cooked.) After it's done, you use the included strainer to easily separate the nut pulp from the gorgeous nut milk liquid. You're done! The SoyaPower G4 nut milk maker produces both raw nut milks and cooked nut milks , depending on your selection. The entire grinding and cooking chamber of the device is made out of stainless steel , so your nut milk never comes into contact with plastic. Click here to get one from the selfnews Store . Also makes quinoa porridge, soup and hot chocolate! What really blew my mind about the SoyaPower G4 is how it can also be used to make porridge, soup and even hot chocolate. Simply drop cacao nibs into the device, add water, and it makes super healthy hot chocolate in minutes! (You might also add some palm sugar as a healthy sweetener.) Check out the video on this page at the selfnews Store for even more ideas and recipes for putting the SoyaPower G4 to good use. Saves you a HUGE amount of money on nut milk One of the best benefits of using this breakthrough appliance is that it saves you huge dollars on nut milks . If you're buying nut milk at the store, you're paying mostly for water. All nut milks are predominantly made of water, and water is very expensive to ship around because it's heavy. It's far more economical to buy your own raw nuts and add filtered water at home, then blend your own finished nut milk for pennies on the dollar . With the SoyaPower, you can literally make your own almond milk for about 1/10th the cost of commercial nut milk . And that means the appliance pays for itself very quickly while saving you money every time you use it. Given today's skyrocketing food prices , it's more and more difficult to feed yourself healthy food on a budget, right? But this appliance is a key solution: it saves you money while increasing the quality of your diet! (Plus, you can stop drinking powdered limestone rocks!) Get yours now at the selfnews Store . This simple appliance has revolutionized my own diet It's extremely rare for an appliance to really change the way I eat. The Vita-Mix is, of course, a breakthrough appliance that's absolutely central to my own diet (I use it every morning to blend a superfood smoothie). Now, the SoyaPower G4 is in the same category: it's a life-changing appliance because it makes the process of creating your own nut milk incredibly convenient. In fact, if I had to name the three most important health-related appliances I know of today, they would be: #1) The Vita-Mix #2) The Excalibur food dehydrator #3) The SoyaPower G4 nut milk maker With those three appliances, you're all set! And if you want to grow your own food for pennies on the dollar , I'm releasing the Food Rising grow system videos and plans next week at www.FoodRising.org Suddenly, eating healthy is more affordable than ever!

0," It's mind-blowing to learn that many farmers and ranchers are reluctant to use natural therapies for their livestock. Granted, their livelihood is completely contingent on the health and well-being of their animals, but taking a non-medical approach should definitely NOT be considered 'experimental!' Research today supports traditional uses For thousands of years, herdsmen have used traditional folk medicine to treat their livestock and it should be no different today. One approach, people generally are not familiar with is the use of therapeutic grade essential oils to treat a wide spectrum of health concerns germane to animals. A word about flies The journal Parasitology Research published an article in 2012 stating that, The housefly Musca domestica L. is recognized as a public health pest causing a serious threat to human and livestock by vectoring many infectious diseases. [The] chemical control method commonly used against this pest, though effective, has some major disadvantages, such as development of insect resistance and bioaccumulation. Pest management strategies for populations of houseflies are needed. In an effort to provide a solution, Indian researchers evaluated how peppermint, ginger, Indian gooseberry and cinnamon essential oils act as a natural insect repellant. They discovered: Peppermint exhibited a 96.8 percent larvicidal activity and 98.1 percent effectiveness at oviposition (egg laying). Ginger exhibited 84.9 percent repellency and 98.1 percent oviposition deterrence. Cinnamon exhibited 77.9 percent repellency and 60.0 percent oviposition deterrence. Gooseberry exhibited 63.0 percent repellency and 42.6 percent oviposition deterrence. Livestock conditions treated by essential oils Dermatitis - Italian researchers published a study this year uncovering how dogs suffering from dermatitis can effectively be treated by a mixture of essential oils (orange, helichrysum, lavender, oregano, marjoram, peppermint). Amazingly, after treating with an application twice daily for a month, the natural cure outperformed the pharmaceutical-grade cream given to the animals and the benefits lasted for over 180 days with no side effects. Mastitis - Another group of Italian researchers conducted a similar study regarding mastitis and discovered that winter savory and thyme achieved superior results in killing mastitis caused by E. coli and S. aureus . Parasites - Brazilian researchers recently published a study in the journal Veterinary Parasitology that evaluated the efficacy of essential oil therapy on gastrointestinal parasites in sheep. Looking at lemon eucalyptus egg hatch and larval development tests, 30 naturally infected sheep were tested and they discovered that the essential oil therapy reduced worm activity by up to 56 percent in just 10 days. Do-it-yourself There are several different ways you can use essential oils for your animals and for your barnyard.

0," Live in Europe? Get your herbs while they last. New rules put forth by the European Union (EU) will ban the sale of certain herbal remedies that have been used for centuries. Traditional herbs such a St. John's Wort or Echinacea must now meet strict licensing guidelines in order to be sold, while other lesser-known herbs that haven't been 'traditionally' used in the last 30 years won't even make the cut to reach consumer shelves. Only those products that have been 'assessed' by the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will be available for purchase. The real kicker? Even approved products will only be recommended for minor ailments such as the common cold, which means that product labeling may no longer be allowed to convey the potent health benefits of widely-used herbal remedies. According the the EU, the laws were put in place to protect consumers from the 'damaging' effects of traditional herbal remedies. The subtext of that statement, of course, is that herbal remedies can sometimes have dangerous interactions when taken with prescription drugs. Used alone, however, herbal supplements rarely pose a problem. With so many people taking prescription drugs, it's clear that the EU's move to ban herbal products is a monopolistic attack on the alternative health movement. While they can't admit the dangerous and deadly side effects of manufactured drugs, they can shift the blame to herbs. Richard Woodfield, MHRA head of herbal medicine policy, claims that the new regulations empower the consumer: 'The current signs are that the [herbal remedy] market will be lively and competitive. The key difference for consumers is that in the future they will be in the driving seat and able to make an informed choice when they wish to use these medicines.' Banning widely-used natural substances that may help cure or prevent illness promotes 'informed' choices? Paul Gimson, director of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Wales, also claims that herbal remedies may not be safe because they have not been put through clinical trials in the same way drugs are tested. Isn't this a tad obvious, however, since drug companies would never even consider testing or promoting a natural herb as a medicinal cure? Clearly, herbal remedies are not widely used because doctors or health care professionals recommend them. They are used because people know they work. The most disturbing part? These regulations point to a movement toward complete restriction of herbal products and the idea that pharmaceutical companies may someday have patents on herbal remedies. Consider a possible scenario: A woman who has been taking Chasteberry supplements to regulate a gynecological condition may now need a prescription for it. She goes to her doctor and, instead of giving her the herb , he recommends a drug. She can no longer buy Chasteberry supplements unless she scours the Internet in search of a reputable company that sells safe herbal products. As we all know, these companies can be hard to find. Not only do these laws threaten the livelihood of nutritionists, herbalists and holistic healthcare providers across Europe , but they put consumers in a lose-lose situation: go without herbal remedies or run the risk of purchasing them online. Vicky Perks, clinical nutritionist at The Health Diva and health food store, Beanfreaks, notes that the regulations are 'poorly thought out' and are driven by money: 'Licensing is just a way of generating extra money for the government. It costs 50,000 to license one product.' Herbal products still on shelves will be for sale until their expiration dates. Stock up while you can. "
0," Let's get right to the point -- most people love salt. Perfecting how to eat salt is an art most have not yet discovered. Not all salts are equal. Alton Brown of Food Network fame explains that all salt is sea salt from one time or another, even if it's found in the Himalayas. Many natural salts have gained gourmet status; and, are recommended for their rich mineral content providing numerous health benefits. Choosing a salt depends on individual taste preferences and upon the application for which it will be used. So without further ado -- I give you salt. Kosher salt versus table salt Table salt is the most common salt found in most kitchens. It's a finely ground, refined form of rock salt, slightly bitter tasting from additives used to keep it from clumping. Most minerals are removed during processing. Some forms of table salt are artificially treated with iodine. Kosher salt has a milder, less pungent taste than table salt and is the choice of many chefs. The flavor disperses quickly as it dissolves fast. The course crystals are excellent for curing meats. Course salt Himalayan Pink Salt: A star among salts, Himalayan salt is typical of coarse salts, with large-grained crystals best used in a salt grinder. Course salts are not as moisture sensitive as other types, allowing them to be stored for long periods. Himalayan pink salt is unrefined and high in minerals, making it a healthful choice. Useful for both seasoning or as a finishing salt. Seasoning salt versus finishing salt Brown explains that seasoning salt draws out and enhances the flavor of food during cooking. Finishing salt is sprinkled just before eating, '...adding a burst of salty goodness and crunchy texture at the very end'. Seasoning salts Kala Namak: Unrefined, authentic Indian salt with a strong sulfuric flavor. Preferred by vegan chefs for adding an egg-like flavor to dishes. Hawaiian Alaea sea salt: Traditional red-colored salt used for preserving and seasoning foods. Enriched with Alae , a volcanic baked red clay, which adds iron oxide for color and flavor. Earthy and mellow tasting and used in authentic Hawaiian dishes. French sea salt: Hand harvested from the Atlantic coast of France, this salt is unrefined and high in minerals, especially natural iodine. A perfect replacement for the chemical taste of iodized salt. The salt has a moist texture and is lower in sodium chloride that other salts. Finishing salts Italian sea salt: From the coast of Sicily, this unrefined salt is rich in magnesium, iodine, fluorine, potassium and sodium chloride. Delicate and flavorful. Hawaiian Hiwa Kai or Black sea salt: Black in color due to the addition of activated charcoal, which enhances the flavor. The charcoal is known for its ability to aid a detox as well as neutralize stomach acids, helping to prevent acid reflux. Celtic sea salt or Grey salt: Grey salt, collected by hand on the Brittany coast in France, is considered one of the best salts by many in the culinary world. The unrefined salt is loaded with minerals, comes in coarse, fine or extra fine grind and provides a rich, luscious flavor. Fleur de sel: Considered the caviar of salts, this specialty salt is hand harvested from the Guerande region salt ponds in France. The salt blooms like a flower on the water's surface under 'just right' weather conditions . It's only harvested once a year. Said to melt slowly on the tongue with a lingering, earthy flavor. Sprinkling salt Most restaurant and professional chefs are taught to salt a dish by using the three-fingered pinch method. Although this seems like a lot of salt the first time you take a pinch, in reality it's the equivalent of 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. So salt with style using this method and stay in control to prevent over-salting a dish. What's in your salt cellar? "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) As any parent will tell you, life for the average teen is a juggling act. They do their best to juggle their jumble of tasks, but almost inevitably, something gets neglected. And for the overwhelming majority of teens living in the U.S. today, that something is nutrition. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's 2007 polling data of 100,000 teenagers, just 13 percent of teens are getting the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables into their diet daily. That's approximately one in every 10 teens. Adults fared better, with about a third of them eating at least two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables per day, but a third is a far cry from health officials' goal: For 75 percent of Americans to be eating at least that amount. The reasons Americans aren't receiving proper nutrition run the gamut: lack of time, lack of will, lack of willpower, or lack of knowledge. A serving qualifies as e.g. 1 orange, 12 cherries, 1/2 cup vegetable juice, or 1/2 potato. It's also likely due to the fact that people with on-the-go lifestyles complain of 'not having the time' for balanced nutrition. But this excuse will ring hollow when teenage boys grow older and find that they're not as well-built, or when teenage girls have brittle bones by the time they're in their 30s. Cells are in an almost constant state of growth and development in adolescence, and these cells rely on fruits and vegetables for vitamins A, C and E, which fuel cellular development. Bone health is largely determined during teen years as well. Bones rely on calcium from sources like spinach and on vitamin B6 from sources like bananas for proper development and density. True, teens have the rest of their lives to improve their diets, but the teen years are crucial to the formation of dietary habits; it's where they take shape. And the earlier those habits entrench themselves, the greater the likelihood that teenager will succumb to age-related diseases come adulthood. According to a study published this month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, rats fed a diet low in vitamins (i.e., vitamin K) were more likely to develop weakening of the bones and hardening of the arteries. Teens can typically get away with eating junk food from a standpoint of weight gain; their metabolism is revved at a much higher rate than the average adult's is. What the average adult stores as fat, the teen burns off. But the infrequency with which teens, apparently, eat fruits and vegetables is not without consequence. Those consequences will become apparent as they grow older, as the quality of their development will no doubt be a shell of what it could have been.

0," Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose standoff with federal officials of the Bureau of Land Management made national headlines thanks in large part to the alternative media, has intervened in an Oregon case involving a father-and-son ranching team scheduled to report to federal prison in a few days. As selfnews reported exclusively , Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven Hammond, 46, were convicted in 2012 under a federal anti-terrorism statute, of committing arson on federal land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. Both were charged in connection with a 2001 fire, and Steven in connection with another fire in 2006. Though the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 calls for a minimum sentence of five years in prison, U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan now retired gave them lighter sentences because he did not believe they had exhibited malicious intent. Federal prosecutors appealed Hogan's three-month sentence for Dwight Hammond, and one-year sentence for Steven Hammond which both had served because they were far short of the minimum. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and ordered them re-sentenced in October, which they duly were. Now, however, as the date approaches for the Hammonds to report to federal prison to finish out their sentences, Bundy and patriot groups are seeking last-minute intervention by local authorities over what they view as unconstitutional and improper charges and sentencing directed at the Hammonds. 'Constitution limits government' 'With great concern and love and much consideration from prayer, I come to you Harney County Sheriff of Oregon David M. Ward, rancher Steven Dwight Hammond, and rancher Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr.,' Cliven wrote in a letter that was also posted online, on his blog site . 'I, Cliven D. Bundy, have been involved for several weeks in the background striving to understand and comprehend your dilemmas in Harney County, Oregon,' his letter continued. 'I understand that the grass that was burnt on each side of the fence was grazing rights that had been created through beneficial use, one side of the fence being private property and the other side of the fence being private property rights. The fires that were set were for a good purpose and had good results.' Bundy asserted that the U.S. government 'has NO jurisdiction or authority' in Oregon , especially 'over this type of ranch management.' 'These lands are not under U.S. treaties or commerce, they are not article 4 territories, and Congress does not have unlimited power,' Bundy wrote. 'These lands have been admitted into statehood and are part of the great State of Oregon and the citizens of Harney County enjoy the fullness of the protections of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution limits United States government.' 'Evidentiary hearing' Bundy wants Sheriff Ward to intervene on behalf of the Hammonds, to take them into custody for their own protection. 'It is my suggestion, Steven Hammond, that you go and check yourself into Harney County jail asking for protective custody. It is my suggestion, Dwight Hammond, that you go and check yourself into Harney County jail asking for protective custody,' he wrote. 'It is my suggestion, Harney County Sheriff David Ward, accept these two ranchers into your jail, notify the United States Solicitor in Washington DC that you have these two ranchers in Harney County jail, that they will remain there indefinitely under your protective custody and the protection of We the People of Harney County and We the People of the United States of America.' As before, contained in a redress of grievances filed with local and federal officials on behalf of the Hammonds, Bundy is calling for a grand jury to be convened, to reexamine the case against the Oregon ranchers. 'I suggest an Evidentiary Hearing or a Grand Jury be formed by We the People.' Sources: http://bundyranch.blogspot.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBBJe7FmRXI http://www.selfnews.com "
0," At a time when the nation was involved in two wars and there was already plenty of strain on the military's budget, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was pressuring the Defense Department to spend scarce Pentagon resources (and taxpayer dollars) to research irritable bowel syndrome. The revelation was contained in a new book, Duty , by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who admitted when he received the request from Reid that he didn't quite know how to react to it, especially given that with 'all the major issues we had to deal with, my personal contacts with Senate Majority Leader Reid were often in response to his calls about Air Force objections to construction of a windmill farm in Nevada because of the impact on their radars,' Gates wrote. 'He also once contacted me to urge that Defense invest in research on irritable bowel syndrome,' he said. 'With two ongoing wars and all our budget and other issues, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.' It wasn't the only time that Reid, who has a history of outrageous behavior and silly requests, got on the bad side of Gates. 'Disgraceful' The former defense chief, who served during the Bush and Obama administrations, said that one time the Senate majority leader made the comment during the troop surge in the Iraq War that 'this war is lost' [ http://www.youtube.com ] - a statement that Gates described as 'disgraceful.' 'I think the troops knew the score,' Gates said recently during an interview on MSNBC. 'The troops believed and believe that they were being successful in their mission. So I think they were able to a certain extent to set aside the politics here at home.' 'Although,' he said emphatically, 'I make the point in the book: when you have somebody like the Senate Majority Leader come out in the middle of the surge and say 'this war is lost' - I thought that was one of the most disgraceful things I've heard a politician say. That sends a riveting message to kids who are putting their lives on the line every day, that they're doing it for nothing, and that was absolutely not the case.' In his book, Gates wrote this about the incident: 'I was furious and shared privately with some of my staff a quote from Abraham Lincoln I had written down long before. 'Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled or hanged.'' In the days since, Reid has fired back at Gates, impugning his character - which is typical for a politician to do - and questioning his motives for writing Duty . 'Just out to make a buck ' In comments last week, Reid said Gates was making certain charges about him and others in the Obama administration because he was 'out to make a buck' (though Gates' net worth is already north of $5 million - about the same as Reid's). 'He denigrates everybody, everyone, Secretary (of State Hillary Rodham) Clinton, the president, (Vice President) Joe Biden, me,' Reid told reporters. He added that he hadn't talked to Obama about the book but he has spoken to Biden about it. 'We just lamented how disappointed we were. It's obvious it's to sell a book,' he said. 'I'm surprised he would in effect denigrate everybody he came in contact with in an effort to make a buck.' Elsewhere in the book, Gates described additional interaction with Reid, saying the Nevada Democrat called him in 2008 before Obama had named a running mate, as reported by the Associated Press: 'Reid said he was thinking about me. ... He asked if I had a public position on abortion; I laughed, saying no. He asked if I was a longtime Republican; I said actually, no.' Gates wrote that Reid wanted to keep the conversation private, adding, 'I couldn't figure out if he was serious, if it was just idle flattery, or if he was delusional.'

0," In a recent publicity stunt gone terribly but humorously wrong, Piers Morgan, the infamous CNN personality and British journalist whose unconstitutional views on gun control have sparked petitions for his deportation, agreed to take his first ever flu shot during a live taping of The Dr. Oz Show that aired on January 11, 2013. But just 10 days later, Morgan, who promised to 'go after' Oz if he developed the flu following the shot, ironically came down with flu-like symptoms that all but debilitated him from hosting his own Piers Morgan Tonight show. An obvious ploy to both quell the growing public distrust of the flu shot and advocate for its alleged safety and effectiveness, Morgan agreed to be this year's media guinea pig in receiving a flu shot injection directly from vaccine advocate Dr. Mehmet Oz, who we recently exposed as being a shill for industrial agriculture ( http://www.selfnews.com/038157_Dr_Oz_organic_food_sellout.html ). In front of a live studio audience, Morgan rolled up his sleeve and received the injection to help dispel the 'myth' that flu shots cause the flu or are in any way dangerous. You can view the clip of Morgan receiving a flu shot from Dr. Oz here: http://youtu.be/cr4RImZVHiY But just a few days later, Piers reportedly began to develop flu-like symptoms that clearly inhibited his ability to speak properly. His symptoms quickly worsened, prompting him to publish a 'tweet' on January 23, just 11 days after getting his flu shot, explaining that his voice had 'plunged to [a] ludicrous level, fading in and out.' Following this, Morgan added, 'Not entirely sure I'll make tonight's live show at this rate.' So much for all that talk about the safety and effectiveness of the flu shot , and Dr. Oz's absurd claim that flu shots cannot cause the flu. As made perfectly evident for millions of Americans to see, Morgan's health quickly began to declined almost immediately after getting a flu shot from Dr. Oz, which is highly suspicious and greatly concerning. Morgan himself essentially affirmed just days later during an interview with country signer Dwight Yoakam that the flu shot he received was responsible for spurring his illness. 'We're both doing the math, aren't we,' retorted Morgan to Yoakam, who had just advised the controversial television personality to never again get a flu shot. 'We both saw him put that thing in my arm, and within 10 days I've been struck down.' You can watch the segment with Morgan and Yoakam here: http://youtu.be/X5SQPPvR-JA Millions of Americans now know that flu shots can make them sick, thanks to Piers Morgan It is difficult not to chuckle at the whole ridiculous charade. What was meant to further pull the wool over the eyes of gullible Americans literally blew up in the face of those that perpetrated it, as millions of Americans have now had their eyes opened to the fact that flu shots are dangerous and can, indeed, cause flu-like symptoms and other health damage. And what better elitist personality to take the fall for this failed attempt at promoting worthless flu shots than Piers Morgan , whose unabashed hatred for the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is helping to fuel a resurgence of appreciation for our precious right as Americans to own weapons for our own protection. With that said, it just might be appropriate to actually thank Piers Morgan for hammering what is hopefully the last nail in the coffin of the flu vaccine scam. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The USDA is currently reviewing the second generation of agricultural biotechnology giant Monsanto's 'Roundup Ready' soybean for deregulation. If the USDA decides to deregulate, the crop could be planted and moved without permits or supervision, and it would probably be commercially introduced in 2009. Jump directly to: conventional view | alternative view | bottom line What you need to know - Conventional View Monsanto's 'Roundup Ready' product line consists of plants genetically engineered to be resistant to the company's Roundup brand of herbicide, so that producers can spray the weed killer without damaging their crops. Monsanto estimates that 87 percent of soybean fields in the United States and 60 percent outside the United States planted first-generation Roundup Ready plants in 2005. The company says that the new soybean, MON 89788, may increase crop yields by 4 to 7 percent more than the first-generation variety. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has recommended approval of MON 89788, calling it as safe as non-genetically modified varieties. The USDA will be accepting public comments on the proposed deregulation until April 6. What you need to know - Alternative View Statements and opinions by Mike Adams, executive director of the Consumer Wellness Center Genetically Modified crops pose a risk to the safety of the food supply due to the risk of unexpected cross-contamination or unknown ecosystem disruptions. We encourage all consumers to buy non-GMO foods only, and avoid the consumption of genetically modified crops or animals. Bottom line The USDA is accepting public comments until April 6 before deciding whether to approve Monsanto's newest 'Roundup Ready' genetically engineered soybean. "
0," One of the most common wild plants found throughout the world, cattail, is astoundingly versatile. So much so that it can make the difference between life and death if one is lost in the wilderness or when food is in short supply. But this humble plant is also extremely handy in ordinary, day-to-day situations too. If you have access to an area with cattail, an exceptional survival resource is right at your fingertips. Year-round usefulness Most of us have come across cattail at one time or another. Distinguished by a brown cigar-shaped head on a hearty stalk, cattail grows in wet areas often close to streams, ponds and lakes. As one of the most functional wild plants, cattail offers different uses during each season. Early spring - Fresh shoots begin to sprout and can be dug up and (once peeled) eaten raw or sauteed. Additionally, the lower part of the leaves can be added to salads. Summer - This is the season when the uses for cattail are most abundant. Once a stem is pulled from the ground, you will notice the lower part is white. When eaten raw, it tastes similar to cucumber. Cooked, it tastes like corn. Lower cattail stalks are a good source of vitamins A, B and C along with potassium and phosphorus. During midsummer, a yellow pollen appears that can be used as flour or thickener for soups and stews. To harvest the pollen, bend the cattail head into a paper bag and shake. In late summer, green flower spikes appear and can be eaten like corn on the cob. Autumn - The root of cattail can now be harvested. Wash thoroughly and submerge in water - let sit until a gel forms. Drain the gel and use for bread making and soups. For a protein-rich flour, dry the roots and grind. It can also be roasted and ground for a healthy coffee substitute. Winter - In northern climates, cattail root is difficult to collect, but not impossible if you can break through frozen ground and ice. In late winter, new shoots begin to emerge, once again providing a food source. Cattail also has many other uses. The brown, tight heads are often dry at the core (even after heavy rain) and can be used as survival tinder. Likewise, dipping the head in oil or fat will create a useable torch. Similar to down, the head yields a fluffy wool when broken apart and serves as excellent insulation for pillows, mattresses and clothing. If lost in the wilderness, a makeshift bed made with cattail down will help protect against heat loss, while the long leaves of the plant can be woven into mats and shelters. Medicinally, the gel found within the leaves act as a topical anesthetic. And a poultice made from the roots will soothe stings, burns and cuts. Before trotting off to reap the benefits of cattail, a word of warning from Kat Morgenstern of Sacred Earth : 'Personally I do not harvest any roots or shoots in order to avoid negatively impacting next year's growth. The pollen and the cobs are by far the safest and easiest parts to collect. Furthermore, it requires some skill to distinguish young cattails from young Yellow Irises - which are poisonous, so unless you are an experienced forager and know how to distinguish these plants before their flowering parts appear, it may be better to leave those young plants alone. 'Last, but not least, cattail is said to have a certain emmenagogue action and should therefore be avoided during pregnancy.'

0," The history of herbal medicine is pretty amazing. All around the world, for thousands of years, herbalists and natural practitioners have developed an impressive body of knowledge about the healing properties of thousands of different plants and herbs to help treat virtually every malady known to man. Some plants, like willow bark, were valued for specific medical properties: In this case, to break fevers and reduce pain and inflammation. Other herbs and plants were valued because of their ability to improve overall health and general quality of life. One such herb is Rhodiola rosea (also known as golden root). Rhodiola has been used in Ayurvedic medicine and other natural healing traditions in Asia for thousands of years and has long been valued for its general tonic properties. And modern science appears to be backing this up. Read on to find out more about the health benefits - including increased longevity - bestowed by this amazing herb. Rhodiola research from UCI This latest study on Rhodiola , a yellow-flowering alpine plant and one with a long history of medicinal use, is come out of the University of California, Irvine . Here, scientists are looking at the effects this plant can have on the human body. To begin with, the found that the benefits of taking Rhodiola are unrelated to diet and that active ingredients in this plant improve health by acting on a complex of biological pathways to support better overall bodily functions and lengthen the lifespan. This discovery is considered to be significant: Traditionally, the medical community has held that dietary restriction is one of the key components of lengthening lifespan, especially restriction of things like sodium and saturated fats. In fact, however, Rhodiola worked even when there was not dietary restriction placed on the fruit flies. Increased quantity - and quality - of life This study, which did take place on fruit flies, did indeed find that regular use of Rhodiola did improve the lifespan of the fruit flies - and significantly, around 25 percent. Because of this, researchers speculate that the use of this herb could possibly help increase the longevity of those who are already healthy. This makes Rhodiola 's active compounds different from, for instance, resveratrol. Resveratrol is an active compound found in red grapes or red wine and has been shown to also increase life expectancy, but only on those who are overweight or in some other way unhealthy. The scientists also noted that not only did Rhodiola increase the life expectancy, but it also delayed the loss of physical performance which is considered to be a natural part of the aging process (in fruit flies and humans!) and thus presumably not only enhanced the quantity but the quality of life. In conclusion, while the researchers acknowledge that further studies are needed to better understand the way that Rhodiola works in the human body - and if it can promote longevity in humans - this preliminary study is certainly thought-provoking. It would hopefully lead in the future to more in-depth studies that will give science a better understanding of Rhodiola 's life-extending potential.

0," For most lazy Americans it is easier to pop a pooping pill than to change the diet or exercise. They would rather pay to poop now and manage the side-effects later than change harmful lifestyle habits. This is why the FDA just approved the drug linaclotide, AKA Linzess (jokingly dubbed laziness ), recently for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). But if you really want healthy bowel movements don't rush out to demand this medication from your pill-pushing doc. Constipation affects up to 27 percent of American adults and occurs more often in women, causing many negative symptoms that hurt quality of life. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder that comes with chronic abdominal pain and decreased bowel movements - ultimately leading to output of hard and dry stool. Constipation is often caused by medications, health conditions, diet and lifestyle choices. How safe is Linzess? Long-term side-effects are actually non-existent with the new drug Linzess . Not because it is a super drug, but because 26 weeks of study on 804 people is what you get. How responsible is this? Other Linzess studies were 12 weeks during treatment phase with a four-week follow-up period. 16 percent of study participants dropped out with diarrhea in one of these 12-week studies. But, there's no need to wait for long-term studies to see how safe this drug is as long-term studies are very costly and documenting those pesky side-effects can keep a blockbuster drug off the market. Unfortunately, this turns the public into the cost-efficient and high-paying lab rats for a look at long-term side-effects. Known side-effects of linaclotide: The biggest major adverse event associated with this new class of drugs has been diarrhea, while other adverse effects reported were flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, headaches, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory and urinary tract infections. Treat the causes and the symptoms go away! Here are a few natural suggestions to 'speed things up.' Fiber - For both constipation and IBS, dietary fiber is the first line of intervention for symptom relief. But the usual causes of slow bowels lie a little deeper in nutritional deficiencies, dysbiosis (fungus or bad bacteria overgrowth), dehydration, and food sensitivities. Vitamin C - One symptom of vitamin C deficiency is constipation . Taking vitamin C in amounts just below bowel tolerance (gas, bloating or diarrhea) can definitely improve bowel movements and regularity. Start slow with 4,000 mg spread throughout the day and every four days add another 1,000 mg to the regimen. When you reach bowel tolerance and stools loosen up, back off a little if they get too loose or maintain the dose that works for you. Probiotics - When the wrong bacteria or fungi gain control of the bowels, they slow things down to ferment foods just how they like them. A high potency probiotic can help change that. Alternate through probiotic brands to keep the bad guys from mustering a counter-defense. Dehydration - Without enough fluids to move things through the intestinal tract, the feces becomes hard and digestion slows way down. Drinking a large glass of water upon awaking improves bowel movements in most cases. Drinking a large glass of water every two hours of the day can also alleviate IBS symptoms. Food sensitivities - A big symptom of food sensitivity is constipation. Studies show that milk can cause constipation and a more recent study also implicates gluten. Constipation is more likely to occur in children fed gluten at six months or earlier - bringing a 35 percent increased risk of constipation. So don't be a lazy bum (pun intended). If you have slow moving bowels, bowel pains or both, find the cause and fix it! Treating the symptoms only hides the causes, allowing sub-clinical problems to grow into bigger problems. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A diet rich in fiber can halve the risk of breast cancer among young women, according to a new study by Leeds University. Cereal fiber, such as that found in whole bread and cereals, was found to be particularly effective. '[This] study further highlights the importance of eating a healthy diet for reducing the risk of cancer,' said Ed Yong, information officer for Cancer Research UK. Researchers found no significant effect, however, on the breast cancer risk of post-menopausal women. Janet Cade, who headed the study, says that this is why no one has noticed the effects of fiber on breast cancer before. 'Previous research hasn't shown a convincing link between increased dietary fiber and the lower risk of breast cancer,' Cade said. 'But earlier studies didn't draw any distinction between pre- and post-menopausal women.' According to the study's authors, there are three possible reasons for the anti-cancer effects of a high fiber diet: First, fiber has a stabilizing effect on the body's insulin levels. High insulin levels have been shown to contribute to the risk of cancer. Second, high-fiber foods also tend to be rich in other essential nutrients, including those with antioxidant properties. Third, and perhaps most relevant, dietary fiber reduces the levels of estrogen in the body, which has been shown to correlate with the risk of breast cancer. These levels are higher in younger women, which may explain the age split that researchers discovered. According to the study, pre-menopausal women should eat at least 30 grams of fiber per day to reduce their cancer risk. By contrast, the American Dietetic Association recommends a minimum of 25 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie diet. Breast cancer is the second most fatal cancer among women, after lung cancer. Between one in 13 and one in nine women will contract it at some point in their lives. The study was funded by the World Cancer Research Fund and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. ### "
0," Some lawmakers in Delaware believe that residents who receive state and federal food assistance should be required to make healthier food choices, to provide a better return on the taxpayers' investment. One such lawmaker, Republican Tim Dukes of Laurel, is so convinced of it that he has recently sponsored new legislation requiring it. 'This problem, food stamps, SNAP is supplemental nutrition, and that's what we're focusing on. We want to see people purchasing nutritional food,' said Dukes. Right now, there are few requirements for federal and state food stamp recipients to buy less of the most questionable foods, in terms of health: sugary or salty snacks, desert items, sugary soft drinks, energy drinks and high-calorie foods, all of which have been proven to lead to heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and other costly health problems. Dukes told local media that his bill does not in any way reduce the amount of benefits or the amount of food that can be purchased by the state's 'most vulnerable citizens.' However, he said, 'I just believe it is ludicrous to have a government nutrition program that subsidizes poor nutritional habits.' In addition, his legislation would direct the Delaware Health and Social Services Department to seek a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees federal food stamp and assistance programs, in order to be able to implement the revisions.

0," People who really know about health know about virgin coconut oil . It's the oil of choice for health-conscious people, and it's used in everything from smoothies (delicious!) to personal care products. You can use coconut oil both inside and outside your body. It's even useful for cooking because coconut oil has a much higher temperature tolerance than even extra virgin olive oil. Its fat molecules stay intact, in other words, at higher stovetop temperatures, so that makes it safer for use as a cooking oil. It's also widely used in raw foods recipe as a stabilizer and source of delicious plant-based fats with their own unique nutritional properties. Virgin coconut oil is 44.6% lauric acid, 16.8% myristic acid, and 8.2% palmitic acid, and it's composed mostly of medium-chain-fatty-acids (MCFA). MCFAs are widely regarded as extremely useful for providing sustainable energy due to their molecular structure. Many bodybuilders and athletes rely on MCFAs as a key part of their high-performance diets. I've been an advocate of organic virgin coconut oil for years, recommending all the top companies such as Nutiva ( www.Nutiva.com ) and Vivapura ( www.VivaPura.net ). They provide outstanding coconut oil products that I use myself on a regular basis. Now, we've teamed up with The Raw Food World to acquire a large shipment of 100% raw, organic, Kosher, centrifuge virgin coconut oil from the Philippines that's available in the selfnews Store starting today. This is the really good stuff that's processed with a centrifuge, not by cooking, so the coconut oil is both raw and molecularly intact. We're also making it available at a terrific discount to selfnews readers. See below for specials that offer as much as 45% off what you'd normally pay for this kind of premium-grade coconut oil . Here are the details (and below, I describe the process of how this oil is harvested, extracted and packaged): Raw organic Kosher centrifuge-extracted virgin coconut oil This is a special shipment of high-grade certified organic virgin coconut oil. It's a premium grade coconut oil that rivals anything available in the industry today. A 16 oz. container of this oil normally sells for $17.95. Through this selfnews Store special discount, it's now available to selfnews readers for just $10.95 for a 16 oz. container. That's a savings of 39% over the regular price. When you purchase three 16 oz. containers of this coconut oil, the price drops to just $9.98 each. That is nearly a 45% discount off the usual retail price, and it comes out to just over 62 cents per ounce. (These 16 oz. containers are GLASS.) Click here to take advantage of this coconut oil special . Looking for an even better deal? We also have it available in a one-gallon container. The normal retail price for one gallon of this premium coconut oil is $74.95, but we've been able to make it available to selfnews readers for just $49.95 , a savings of 32% off the normal price. And here's the best deal of all: When you purchase three one-gallon containers of this premium coconut oil, the price drops to just $44.96 per gallon . That's a 40% savings over the retail price, and it brings the price per ounce down to just 35 cents! Compare this price anywhere, and you'll see what a tremendous deal this really is. We've put together yet another screaming good deal for our selfnews with this coconut oil offer. (These one gallon containers are PLASTIC. We're working on a way to use glass gallon container in the near future, but breakage is a huge problem during shipping, so right now they're packaged in plastic. If you want glass containers, choose the 16 oz. containers instead.) How coconut oil is harvested and extracted Ever wonder how premium coconut oil is actually made? Here's where ours comes from: First, whole coconuts are collected fresh off the tree, then shelled to remove the outer shell (the brown skin). The white coconut meat is removed and ground at low temperatures into granules. These granules are then dried at 104 - 113 degrees Fahrenheit for 2.5 hours. Once dried, the coconut granules are loaded into a customized cold-process expeller that squeezes out the oil. This is also done at 113 degrees or lower in order to preserve the raw nutrients. The oil that comes out is then loaded into a centrifuge machine that spins it at high speed to remove any moisture or particulate matter. (The solid coconut matter that comes out is used to make coconut flour, which can be substituted for wheat in baking recipes.) The resulting oil is called 'Virgin Coconut Oil.' It is then poured into the final containers, labeled and shipped. Note that there is no cooking, pasteurization, fumigation, hydrogenation or other artificial process involved. This is all about harvesting the coconut meat, drying it, then pressing out the oils to be captured, filtered and packaged. It is probably the most natural process you can find for consuming coconut oil other than picking and eating the coconut yourself. Coconut oil has a surprisingly long shelf life -- up to several years on the shelf due to its ability to naturally resist oxidation. When stored in the refrigerator, it is naturally a solid. When warmed in ambient room temperature, it becomes a liquid. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Using virgin coconut oil Here are several ideas for using coconut oil. If you're right now cooking in a pan with something like olive oil, try replacing that with coconut oil. Coconut oil resists creating high-heat carcinogens, meaning you can cook with it at higher temperatures without poisoning your food as often happens with corn oil, soybean oil or other cheap, low-end vegetable oils. Secondly, you can add coconut oil to just about any smoothie to give it a fatty 'ice cream' flavor and texture. Try blending frozen fruit with palm sugar and coconut oil! It makes a delicious, ice cream textured dessert that will just blow your mind with its nutritional potency, too. (Your kids can eat this all day long, guilt free!) If you're into raw foods recipes, you'll find yourself using coconut oil for all kinds of things. Especially desserts, where coconut oil is often part of the icing that goes on the raw cake or pie. It's super delicious! (And also guilt free...) You can use coconut oil in practically any recipe that calls for vegetable oil or shortening. Shortening, by the way, is just hydrogenated vegetable oil. I hope you never eat that because it's terrible for your health. Replace it with coconut oil for the sake of your health... Coconut oil can also be used as a partial replacement for butter . It doesn't quite have the butter taste, but it's close, and the healthy fats in it resemble butter in many recipes. (Try replacing half the butter in a recipe with coconut oil.) Finally, you can use this coconut oil to make your own skin care products . Melt a small amount of bees wax in a pan with coconut oil, add some medicinal herbs or tinctures, and you've made your own skin salve! Coconut oil is a wonderful base for all sorts of personal care products. I've even seen it packaged as a personal lubricant (no kidding!). It's great for skin, hair, face and your entire body, head to toe. The key is getting the good quality coconut oil that hasn't been cooked. That's why you'll really like what we've acquired for you here: It's a premium-grade coconut oil that's perfect for smoothies, cooking, baking and personal care needs. Get some while our supplies last. As with most of our specials, this is a one-time shipment that will probably be sold out within a few days. Click here to get some of this coconut oil for yourself today . You'll really enjoy this oil. I'm stocking up on some for my own kitchen! "
0," There are numerous alternative treatments for ADHD - some more effective than others. Chinese herbal medicine has roots that go back thousands of years. Surprisingly enough, when modern studies test many of the traditional Chinese herbs used to treat ADHD and other medical conditions, the studies find that the Chinese treatment methods are highly effective at treating the condition they are designed to cure. Find out how the following six Chinese herbs are beneficial in treating both children and adults with ADHD: Thorowax root Thorowax root has cell-stimulating, anti-inflammatory, and sedative effects. When used to treat ADHD, the sedative effects of the herbs can help control impulsive behavior and prevent hyperactivity. The sedative effects are extremely mild, and provide just enough sedation to benefit ADHD - not remove all personality from the child or adult taking the herb. Oriental ginseng Ginseng is an herb known for its concentration-boosting effects, which is why many memory-boosting supplements contain ginseng. Ginseng also increases endurance and relieves stress. The herb is known for its ability to improve oxygen flow to the brain, which encourages normal brain development. As some children with ADHD have a developmental delay of about three years, this is an effective herb for treating ADHD. Skullcap root Skullcap root is an herb that protects the nervous system. In many children with ADHD, the balance of the chemicals in the brain controlling the nervous system is off. Skullcap root can help retain the normal balance of chemicals in the brain. Skullcap root is particularly helpful for preventing hyperactivity and calming the nerves. Red jujube The jujube has many helpful properties, but for ADHD, the herb is more effective for calming the nerves and mind and creating a peaceful effect in the body. Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo biloba is an herb that is known for its ability to boost cognitive function in the brain. Ginkgo increases the amine neurotransmitter substances in the brain, which helps counteract some of the chemical deficiencies often seen in children with ADHD. Ginkgo can calm the mind and promote a peaceful spirit. Poria Poria has many benefits, including improving digestion and soothing the nerves. Many children with ADHD have poor digestion, and supplementing with poria can improve the health of the intestines and promote the elimination of toxins that can contribute to ADHD symptoms. Chinese herbs in scientific studies The theory behind Chinese herbs for ADHD sound beneficial, but without scientific backing, it is all postulation. However, several studies have looked at Chinese herbs and how they can benefit ADHD. In 1990, the Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou College of TCM looked at 100 children with ADHD. Eighty children were given Chinese herbs. At the end of the three-month study, 23 children were completely symptom free, 46 children showed significant improvement, and 10 had higher IQ scores. In 1994, the Shaanxi College of Traditional Chinese Medicine examined 66 children with ADHD. The children were given Chinese herbs to help control their ADHD symptoms. Eighty-give percent of the children who took the Chinese herbs had improvements in symptoms. The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong College of TCM looked at another group of children with ADHD in 1995. This time, the children took liquid Chinese herbs. The effectiveness rate of the herbs was 94 percent. Chinese herbs for ADHD If you are looking for alternatives to Ritalin and other ADHD medications, Chinese herbs could be a viable option. Before reaching for traditional medicines, give Chinese herbs a try. "
0," Tweet A team of Cleveland Clinic experts is reporting that the treatment of iron deficiency, through diet or supplements, may help regrow hair. Led by Wilma Bergfeld, M.D., Head of Clinical Research in the Department of Dermatology at the Clinic, the researchers reviewed the scientific literature that has been published over the past 40 years. Their findings show that iron deficiency may be more closely linked to hair loss than previously thought. The researchers findings appear in the May issue of Journal of American Academy of Dermatology and underline the importance of better understanding the potential association between these conditions. If doctors can understand fully the relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss, then they can help people regrow hair more effectively, Dr. Bergfeld, who is Past President of the American Academy of Dermatology and Co-Founder of the North American Hair Research Society, said. We believe that iron deficiency may be related to many forms of hair loss and that people may need higher levels of iron stores than previously thought to regrow hair. Much of what is known about the relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss is based on studies involving women. Although the data suggests that iron deficiency may be linked to several of the most common kinds of hair loss, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for iron deficiency in hair loss patients, the Clinic researchers report. Further research on this subject is necessary. Even so, physicians at the Cleveland Clinic routinely screen patients with hair loss for iron deficiency. A laboratory test called ferritin is often very sensitive for iron deficiency and can detect it in its early stages. If this early form of iron deficiency is treated, then patients may be able to regrow hair more effectively. Doctors often do not treat this subtle form of iron deficiency and reserve treatment only for its most severe form, called iron deficiency anemia. Iron supplements, which are available over-the-counter, can be very effective in treating hair loss, but they are not for everyone. In fact, they can be dangerous in patients with certain medical conditions and should only be taken under the supervision of a physician. Iron deficiency is the worlds most common nutritional deficiency and is can be caused by inadequate dietary intake, excessive menstrual bleeding, and other forms of blood loss. Treatment of iron deficiency includes adequate dietary intake and, when appropriate, oral iron supplementation. "
0," Eating a single gram of turmeric each day could cause short-term memory improvements in people predisposed to memory loss, according to a study conducted by researchers from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and several Taiwanese research institutes, and published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition . 'Our findings with turmeric are consistent with these observations, insofar as they appear to influence cognitive function where there is disordered energy metabolism and insulin resistance,' researcher Mark Wahlqvist said. Turmeric root has been used as a spice and medicine for thousands of years and is still an important component in traditional Asian cooking and medicinal systems. It is a critical component of curry powders, giving them their yellow color. That yellow color itself comes from a trio of chemicals known as 'curcuminoids,' the most commonly known being curcumin. In recent years, much research has focused on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other health-promoting benefits of curcumin. Six-hour memory boost The new study involved testing the working memories of adults over the age of 60 who had recently been diagnosed with pre-diabetes -- which is known to be associated with memory loss -- but who were not receiving treatment. Participants were fed a breakfast of white bread, supplemented with either 1 gram of turmeric or a placebo. Their memories were tested both before the meal and after it. 'We found that this modest addition to breakfast improved working memory over six hours in older people with pre-diabetes,' Wahlqvist said. As the world's population ages, health experts believe that the prevalence of conditions linked to memory loss will rise, including diabetes and dementia. The researchers suggested that early intervention, including with turmeric, might lessen the prevalence of those conditions and blunt their effects in those who develop them. 'Working memory is widely thought to be one of the most important mental faculties, critical for cognitive abilities such as planning, problem solving and reasoning,' Wahlqvist said. 'Assessment of working memory is simple and convenient, but it is also very useful in the appraisal of cognition and in predicting future impairment and dementia.' The power of curcumin Research has also linked turmeric and curcumin more directly to reduced dementia risk. For example, a 2009 study conducted by researchers from Duke University found that curcumin caused changes in the brain counteracting some of the effects of Alzheimer's disease. The chemical specifically targeted the amyloid plaques believed to be one of the main causes of brain damage (and therefore symptoms). 'There is very solid evidence that curcumin binds to plaques, and basic research on animals engineered to produce human amyloid plaques has shown benefits,' researcher Murali Doraiswamy said. 'You can modify a mouse so that at about 12 months its brain is riddled with plaques. If you feed this rat a curcumin-rich diet, it dissolves these plaques. The same diet prevented younger mice from forming new plaques.' 'If you have a good diet and take plenty of exercise, eating curry regularly could help prevent dementia,' Doraiswamy said. Diet and exercise are still the two best ways to prevent the disease, Doraiswamy emphasized. Research has shown a wide variety of other benefits from turmeric and curcumin, including preventing cancer and improving cancer prognosis, arthritis relief, improved heart health and even reductions in body fat. A series of 2013 studies conducted by researchers from the University of Tsukuba in Japan found that curcumin improved two measures of cardiovascular health as much as aerobic exercise did, while the two together provided the greatest benefit. Studies have shown that curcumin is best absorbed from the turmeric root (or powder) itself, rather than from supplements.

To 'promote social justice,' to improve academic performance in school. The rationale is, the drugged kids will now be able to compete with children from wealthier families who attend better schools. Leading the way is Dr. Michael Anderson, a pediatrician in the Atlanta area. Incredibly, Anderson told the New York Times his diagnoses of ADHD are 'made up,' 'an excuse' to hand out the drugs. 'We've decided as a society that it's too expensive to modify the kid's environment. So we have to modify the kid,' Anderson said. It would be hard to find a clearer mission statement from a psychiatrist: mind control. A researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, Dr. Ramesh Raghavan, goes even further with this chilling comment: 'We are effectively forcing local community psychiatrists to use the only tool at their disposal [to 'level the playing field' in low-income neighborhoods], which is psychotropic medicine.' So pressure is being brought to bear on psychiatrists to launch a heinous behavior modification program, using drugs, against children in inner cities. It's important to realize that all psychotropic stimulants, like Adderal and Ritalin, can cause aggressive behavior, violent behavior. What we're seeing here is a direct parallel to the old CIA program, exposed by the late journalist, Gary Webb, who detailed the importing of crack cocaine (another kind of stimulant) into South Central Los Angeles, which went a long way toward destroying that community. It is widely acknowledged, and admitted in the Times article, that the effects of ADHD drugs on children's still-developing brains are unknown. Therefore, the risks of the drugs are great. At least one leading psychiatrist, Peter Breggin, believes there is significant evidence that these stimulants can cause atrophy of the brain. Deploying the ADHD drugs creates symptoms which may then be treated with compounds like Risperdal, a powerful anti-psychotic, which can cause motor brain damage. All this, in service of ' social justice ' for the poor. And what about the claim that ADHD drugs can enhance school performance? The following pronouncement makes a number of things clear: The 1994 Textbook of Psychiatry, published by the American Psychiatric Press, contains this review (Popper and Steingard):'Stimulants [given for ADHD] do not produce lasting improvements in aggressivity, conduct disorder, criminality, education achievement, job functioning, marital relationships, or long-term adjustment.' So the whole basis for this 'social justice' program in low-income communities---that the ADHD drugs will improve school performance of kids and 'level the playing field,' so they can compete academically with children from wealthier families---this whole program is based on a lie to begin with. Meddling with the brains of children via these chemicals constitutes criminal assault, and it's time it was recognized for what it is. In 1986, The International Journal of the Addictions published a most important literature review by Richard Scarnati. It was called 'An Outline of Hazardous Side Effects of Ritalin (Methylphenidate)' [v.21(7), pp. 837-841]. Adderall and other ADHD medications are all in the same basic class; they are stimulants, amphetamine-type substances. Scarnati listed a large number of adverse affects of Ritalin and cited published journal articles which reported each of these symptoms. For every one of the following (selected and quoted verbatim) Ritalin effects, there is at least one confirming source in the medical literature: Paranoid delusions Paranoid psychosis Hypomanic and manic symptoms, amphetamine-like psychosis Activation of psychotic symptoms Toxic psychosis Visual hallucinations Auditory hallucinations Can surpass LSD in producing bizarre experiences Effects pathological thought processes Extreme withdrawal Terrified affect Started screaming Aggressiveness Insomnia Since Ritalin is considered an amphetamine-type drug , expect amphetamine-like effects Psychic dependence High-abuse potential DEA Schedule II Drug Decreased REM sleep When used with antidepressants one may see dangerous reactions including hypertension, seizures and hypothermia Convulsions Brain damage may be seen with amphetamine abuse. In what sense are the ADHD drugs 'social justice?' The reality is, they are chemical warfare. Licensed predators are preying on the poor.

0," The White House has been caught in yet another lie, and one that it's repeated enough times now that there's no excusing it as just another careless faux pas. Desperate to defend its continued funding of abortion mill Planned Parenthood, the Obama regime is now claiming that this illicit baby chop-shop organization needs your tax dollars to continue providing mammograms to women, a service that it admittedly doesn't even offer . That's right -- Obama and Co. wants Americans to believe that Planned Parenthood requires some half-a-million in taxpayer dollars annually to continue providing breast cancer screenings to women, even though Planned Parenthood doesn't, nor has it ever, offered breast cancer screenings to women . Obama's Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell blatantly lied to the American public when she stated the following during a recent meeting with the House Education and Workforce Committee. 'What I think is important is that our HHS funding is focused on issues of preventative care for women, things like mammograms,' she's quoted as saying. Obama regime continues to lie about Planned Parenthood offering mammograms More important than what Burwell thinks in her deluded mind, though, are the actual facts -- that Planned Parenthood doesn't offer mammograms . Planned Parenthood's supposed 'preventative' services for breast cancer are a complete fabrication intended to persuade feeble minds into thinking, 'Yeah, they're murdering babies and selling their body parts. But think about the women!' Obama himself made the same false claim back in 2012 while on the campaign trail, alleging that 'millions' of women receive mammograms from Planned Parenthood every year. In reality, the actual number of women who receive mammograms from Planned Parenthood every year is precisely zero, as admitted by even the left-leaning Washington Post (WP). 'The problem here is that Planned Parenthood does not perform mammograms or even possess the necessary equipment to do so,' a resident fact-checker at WP admitted, defying the White House lie that the nation's largest abortion provider is in any way concerned with protecting women against breast cancer . 'As such, the organization certainly does not 'provide' mammograms in the strict sense. Instead, its clinics provide referrals and direct low-income women toward resources to help pay for the procedure. These services are by no means unique to Planned Parenthood. In fact, the Susan G. Komen Foundation and the American Cancer Society provide them, as well.' Obama's legacy of lies to be marked by administration's defense of genocide for profit It's all par for the course for Obama's delinquent legacy, it seems -- lie after lie after lie, with some of these lies being the same lies repeated over and over and over again. The White House is even now lying about the undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), which clearly and undeniably expose Planned Parenthood for illegally selling aborted baby parts for profit. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest recently told the media that these videos are somehow 'fraudulent,' even though they contain hours of footage from Planned Parenthood officials and doctors openly talking about extracting aborted babies in a way that avoids 'crushing' them so their body parts can be illegally sold to the highest bidder. 'Watch the videos for yourselves,' encourages Michelle Malkin, writing for CNSNews.com. 'Get the facts. Unmask the lies.' 'The cackling profiteers of Planned Parenthood don't care about your breasts. They're too busy putting price tags on the baby hearts, livers, lungs and limbs swirling around in bloody pie plates, stacked in their 'research' labs, subsidized with your tax dollars and sold to the highest bidders. For 'preventative care,' of course.' Read more stories about what Planned Parenthood is really doing at Abortions.news Also, read the truth about Margaret Sanger at TruthWiki.org "
0," Past research bodies have confirmed the health-protective effect of a natural diet rich in flavonoids to protect against a wide range of diseases including heart disease, hypertension, some cancers, and dementia. Researchers from Harvard University and the University of East Anglia have published the result of a study in the journal Neurology that demonstrates how these plant-based phytonutrients can significantly lower the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, especially in men. Flavonoids from healthy foods such as berries, tea, apples, and red wine cross the delicate blood-brain barrier to protect neurons against neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's. This large scale study included more than 130,000 men and women participants that were followed for a period of twenty years. During this time, more than 800 individuals developed Parkinson's disease. A diet high in flavonoids from berries lowers Parkinson's disease risk by forty percent After a detailed analysis of their diets and adjusting for age and lifestyle, male participants who ate the most flavonoids were shown to be forty percent less likely to develop the disease than those who ate the least. No similar link was found for total flavonoid intake in women. Co-lead study author, Dr. Aedin Cassidy noted 'These exciting findings provide further confirmation that regular consumption of flavonoids can have potential health benefits.' This was the first study to examine the connection between flavonoid consumption and the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings suggest that a sub-class of flavonoids called anthocyanins may exhibit neuroprotective effects. Participants consuming one or more portions of berry fruits each week were around twenty-five percent less likely to develop Parkinson's disease, relative to those who did not eat berry fruits.Flavonoids are the bioactive, naturally occurring chemical compounds found in many plant-based foods and drinks. This study demonstrated the main protective effect was from the consumption of anthocyanins, which are present in berries and other fruits and vegetables including aubergines, blackcurrants, and blackberries. Strawberries and blueberries are the two most common sources of flavonoids in the US diet, contributing to a twenty-four percent lowered risk in this research. Parkinson's disease is among a group of chronic diseases presently affecting one in 500 people, with new cases on the rise. Drug therapies are ineffective and bear significant side effects. The result of this study provides yet another example of the power of a natural diet in the prevention of many debilitating and deadly conditions. Nutrition experts recommend adding a minimum of three to five servings of flavonoids to your diet each week. Include all varieties of berries, apples, and green tea to guard against Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative illnesses. "
0," While you may not have a full-blown food allergy, it is likely that you may have a food sensitivity that has gone undiagnosed. Because reactions to foods or food additives are often delayed and not severe, it can be difficult to determine what is triggering mild symptoms, such as headaches, bloating, constipation, gas or fatigue. However, it's important to discover what your body is rejecting, as even a slight intolerance can cause a toxic buildup and inflammation that leads to greater health problems, including chronic disease, down the road. The eight major food allergens More than 160 foods can cause an allergic reaction, but these eight foods cause up to 90 percent of food allergies, so one or more of these is likely to be the culprit of your intolerance. 1. Milk 2. Eggs 3. Fish 4. Crustacean shellfish 5. Tree nuts 6. Peanuts 7. Wheat 8. Soybeans Try an elimination diet There are several ways to eliminate potential food allergens from your diet. You can either eliminate them one at a time for at least two weeks and add them back in to see if you notice a difference, or you can start out by eliminating every food you suspect could be a trigger food and slowly add them (at least two days apart) back in one by one to test for adverse reactions. It's important to remember that some foods may cause a reaction up to three days after consumption, so it can be difficult to determine what your body is telling you. Keeping a food journal and recording how you feel can also help, but may only be effective if reactions are more immediate. Other types of food and food additive intolerance testing With the countless additives and preservatives that are in our food today, it is likely that you may be intolerant of one or more of these, in which case an elimination diet will not be effective. There are several tests that can be done to determine which foods and food additives you are sensitive to. Release Testing (MRT) is a blood test that identifies food, preservatives and additive triggers. Many chiropractors and naturopaths also use a method known as applied kinesiology, which uses muscle strength and weakness to test for allergies and sensitivities. Electrodermal Vega testing is another option, which looks for abnormal electrical charges in the body to determine what foods or additives will create a condition in the body in which disease can develop. Once these intolerances are identified via testing, you can eliminate the triggers and slowly add them back into your diet after a period of time to confirm that the test results were correct. Can intolerances be cured? After eliminating trigger foods for several months, some people have success re-introducing these foods into their diets in very limited amounts and can tolerate consuming them ever so often (ie: once a week or a couple times per month). Others find that it's best to permanently eliminate these foods . Most conventional medical doctors would say that there is no foolproof cure for allergies, but some alternative health therapies, including Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique, claim to eliminate allergies. This technique exposes the patient to small amounts of the allergen while receiving acupressure or acupuncture treatments in order to reverse negative reactions.

0," As we age, one of the functions that can often deteriorate dramatically is our mental function - our brain power , if you will. The good news is, researchers may have discovered a way to prevent this kind of decline: Eat more berries. That's right. According to research published in the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , eating more blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and other berry fruits may help prevent age-related memory loss and other mental status changes. In the journal article, Dr. Barbara Shukitt-Hale, PhD, and Marshall G. Miller note that as we live longer on average, there are increasing concerns about the social and monetary costs of treating Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of mental decline. That concern will only grow as the U.S. population continues to age . Keep your brain healthy and functioning as you age According to the research, eating more berries can have benefits for the aging brains. 'To analyze the strength of the evidence about berry fruits, they extensively reviewed cellular, animal and human studies on the topic,' said a press release from the ACS. A review of the data found that there was strong scientific evidence that berry fruits help the brain remain healthy in a number of ways. For example, berry fruits contain high levels of antioxidants, 'compounds that protect cells from damage by harmful free radicals.' In addition, research shows that berry fruits alter the manner in which neurons in the brain communicate. 'These changes in signaling can prevent inflammation in the brain that contribute to neuronal damage and improve both motor control and cognition,' said ACS, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress. 'They suggest that further research will show whether these benefits are a result of individual compounds shared between berry fruits or whether the unique combinations of chemicals in each berry fruit simply have similar effects.' 'Berry' good benefits The ACS research isn't the first to suggest that antioxidants in berry fruits are beneficial to your overall health. The Global Healing Center also says berries are high in antioxidants and 'have been shown to be some of the healthiest foods on the planet.' The antioxidants in berries and other fruits act as 'scavengers' of free radicals, which create a destructive process on the cellular level, causing molecules within cells to become unstable, according to Dr. Edward Group. 'They may even be a big player in the formation of cancerous cells by a 'chain-reaction' effect, causing other cells to become damaged,' he writes . 'Because of the inherent instability of free-radicals, they try to attack other healthy cells to get stable themselves. This then causes the once-healthy cells to react in the same way, attacking others in [a] never-ending attempt for cellular stability.' But just like with everything else, some scientists and researchers say you should be careful not to overindulge in antioxidants. 'Too much of a good thing can be bad, and some scientists believe excessive amounts of antioxidants can overtax the immune system, hurting the body's ability to repair itself,' says Robert Wildman, Ph.D., R.D., L.D., a nutritional expert .

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A deficiency in minerals can cause hair loss because hair production requires a wide variety of minerals and trace minerals. Numerous systems in the body participate in the production of hair. For instance, hormonal balance is needed in order for hair to grow, and the hair follicles where hair is produced rely on specific nutrients in order to be stimulated. Selenium Helps Grow Hair Selenium is a trace element used by the body in small but vital quantities. A deficiency of this mineral can lead to heart conditions and cancer, as well as to poor hair growth. Selenium is part of the metabolic pathway of iodine metabolism and also contributes to the synthesis of protein. Selenium is found in the soil, especially in the land around Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, but food grown in other areas of the country may not absorb enough selenium from the soil. Fertilizers prevent the natural absorption of trace minerals from the soil as well; so organic food is likely to contain more of this mineral. Brazil nuts are a good source of selenium, along with brown rice and walnuts. Iodine Prevents Hair Loss The mineral iodine is used by the thyroid gland and iodine deficiency can lead to hair loss. Iodine is found in fish and especially in seaweeds, such as kelp. Iodine is found in sea salt, along with other trace minerals found in the sea. Adding seaweed to the diet can add the additional iodine needed to nourish the thyroid gland and prevent hair loss. Zinc Stimulates the Hair Follicles The cells of the hair follicle utilize zinc. Many Americans are deficient in this mineral as well. Zinc can be taken orally or it can also be applied by use of topical zinc creams designed to help prevent hair loss. Calcium Needed for Hair Growth Calcium and magnesium are both needed to grow hair, as well as to grow bones. The most abundant mineral in the body, calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. Adding sesame seeds to the diet can add much needed calcium. Another good source of calcium is found in cooked spinach, with 120 milligrams in a half-cup. Sardines provide a fish source of calcium with about 100 mg of calcium per ounce. Chinese cabbage and kale also provide a large amount of calcium- about 90 milligrams for each raw cup. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium/ http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/calcium/ http://www.selfnews.com/030171_hair_growt... http://www.selfnews.com/029018_hair_loss_...

0," A report recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that black women who consume fried chicken or fast food burgers at least twice a week are between 40 and 70 percent more prone to develop type 2 diabetes over the course of a decade than those who do not. Not only black women but all people who consume high calorie, low nutrient fast foods on even a moderate basis are susceptible to developing the disease. Dr. Julie Palmer and her colleagues from Boston University analyzed over 44,000 black women who were instructed to complete questionnaires that they were given beginning back in 1995. Once concluded, researchers compared the results with another group of women who claimed never to eat fast food. The result was that not only were the women who ate fast food more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than the non-fast food group, they also were generally heavier with many falling into the overweight range. The standard measuring tool for determining healthy body weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI). A healthy BMI is somewhere between 18.5 and 24.9. Most of the participants in the fast food group were somewhere between 28 and 29 when they started the study, which according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is overweight. Those in this group also continued to gain more weight during the course of the study. Interestingly, the two foods that played the largest role in blood sugar disorder were fast food hamburgers and fried chicken. These foods were implicated in causing the most weight gain which resulted in more cases of diabetes . Nearly 3,000 women in the fast food eating group developed type 2 diabetes by the time the study concluded. A previous fast food study conducted in 2004 by researchers from Boston Children's Hospital found similar results. After tracking more than 3,000 young adults for over 15 years, researchers found that people who ate at fast food restaurants more than twice a week gained an average of almost 10 pounds more than those who went only once a week. The twice a week group also had a 200 percent increase in insulin resistance compared to the once a week group. Experts also concluded that those who ate the most fast food lived the most unhealthy lifestyles in general and were the most prone to developing other serious diseases throughout the course of their lives. While some experts suggest consuming smaller portion sizes and less overall calories, a better option would be to make better food choices. Eating less fast food is good, but changing one's lifestyle to include whole, living foods is even better.

0," The state senator behind California's SB277 forced vaccination law is a pro at spreading misinformation, particularly on social media. Carrying out the job that Big Pharma paid him to do -- which we recently proved by publishing information about the industry cash he's received -- Senator Richard Pan recently posted a Facebook status citing a completely fraudulent article denying the existence of mercury in vaccines, which also made blatantly false statements about selfnews' Mike Adams. Written by PolitiFact Georgia 's April Hunt, the article propagated a multitude of lies including claims that they attempted to contact Adams about his views on mercury in vaccines. Click here for details on the PolitiFact falsehoods based on either shoddy journalism or a deliberate smear campaign. In fact, no contact with Adams was ever made by PolitiFact . PolitiFact 's claim is a blatant lie, one that Senator Richard Pan repeated in an attempt to attack Adams and distract voters from the fact that he received campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies before promoting the SB277 vaccine mandate in California. In February 2015, a time when vaccine propaganda reached its peak following the 'Disneyland Measles Outbreak,' PolitiFact falsely reported that 'Adams declined to speak' with them about 'his conclusions regarding mercury' and that he instead referred them to studies on selfnews.com. The allegation is blatantly false. selfnews is demanding not only a retraction but an apology from both PolitiFact GA and Sen. Pan , as both used falsified reports to attempt to smear Adams' character by insinuating his refusal to stand by his scientific proof that flu shots still contain mercury, a known neurotoxin. 'Who are Pan's handlers?' asks Adams. 'Big drug companies and vaccine manufacturers with deep pockets and a total lack of ethics,' he says. 'Richard Pan is a vaccine industry puppet who has betrayed the children of California in exchange for campaign cash from criminal pharmaceutical companies. If he stays in office, he presents a clear and present danger to all children and families in California... but especially African-American children whom a top CDC scientist has already admitted have a higher risk of autism stemming from vaccinations.' It's very important that the general public understands the tactics that Sen. Pan is using to push mandatory vaccination in California, which brainwash the public into believing that vaccines have no risks, only benefits. You can view videos about vaccine injuries at StopMandatoryVaccination.com . View Richard Pan's Facebook page at this link . Californians seek to boot Senator Pan from office Enraged over the forced vaccination bill recently pushed through by Sen. Pan, Californians have had enough and are actively trying to have him removed from office through a recall. You can find out more about the recall by visiting SB277Recalls.com . To kick Pan out of office, proponents will need to collect 35,926 signatures by the end of December , before convincing a majority of voters that there is sufficient cause to depose a man they elevated to the state Senate mere months ago,' reports The Sacramento Bee . California's last successful recall occurred in 2003 when voters unseated Gov. Gray Davis, replacing him with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Pan's track record is less than admirable. He very well may have broken the law when he discouraged people from signing the SB277 Referendum by quoting from an article saying 'Whatever you do, don't sign it' and posting it on his Facebook page. The SB277 Referendum could potentially reverse forced vaccination in California; learn where to sign here . California law clearly states that 'interference in a recall or referendum effort' is strictly prohibited. You can help pressure Attorney General Kamala D. Harris to act by tweeting her at @CalAGHarris . Supporters of #SB277Referendum can also bring awareness to this issue by using #CanPan on Twitter. Senator Pan is a walking advertisement for Big Pharma To say Pan's position on vaccines is biased would be a severe understatement, as he received more than $95,000 from Big Pharma during the 2013-2014 legislative session. He also accepted donations from Merck & Co. in the 2010 election cycle, in which the pharmaceutical industry was buying politicians and strategically placing them in positions that would guarantee the passing of their sinister vaccine mandate. The idea that Sen. Pan is a 'public health advocate' is outrageous. Terms like these are often used by big government and large corporations to try and trick the public, by assigning a name or title that sounds really great and wonderful when in all actuality the complete opposite is true. Take for example the 'Patriot Act,' which severely infringes on Americans' rights, or the 'Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act,' which sounds really good but aims to prohibit individual states from labeling GMOs and enacting laws limiting the use of toxic glyphosate on crops. Another example is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), which as The Hill describes , 'is an out and out surveillance bill masquerading as a cybersecurity bill.' This is true in Pan's case, as he is not really a 'public health advocate' but a purchased advertisement for vaccines. He doesn't seem to care whether or not vaccines are safe. All he cares about is making sure he posts enough pro-vaccine social media propaganda to meet whatever quota he and Big Pharma likely agreed upon. Pan's Twitter page goes something like this: Going away to college? Don't forget to get your vaccines! #VaccinesWork Thinking about going out of the country? Don't forget to take your vaccines! #VaccinesWork Nine months pregnant and about to give birth? Don't forget to take your vaccines! #VaccinesWork Considering that the vaccine industry has paid out over $3 billion to vaccine-injured families since 1986 , this type of advertising by a state senator is unethical, dangerous and undemocratic.

0," After struggling to maintain its image following a barrage of product recalls and safety scares, Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) has announced that it plans to reformulate not only its entire line of children's personal care products, but also many of its adult personal care products, to remove a number of chemicals and chemical byproducts that have been the topic of public concern in recent years. By 2015, virtually all J&J; consumer care products will be free of preservative chemicals that release methylene glycol, the alcohol form of formaldehyde, which has been identified as a cancer-causing agent. J&J; also plans to remove preservative chemicals that produce 1,4 dioxane, a chemical also linked to causing cancer. ( http://www.selfnews.com/028846_laundry_detergents_dioxane.html ) 'There's a very lively public discussion going on about the safety of ingredients in personal care products, (and) it was really important that we had a voice in that,' said Susan Nettesheim, J&J;'s Vice President for Product Stewardship. Though Nettesheim insists that the existing chemicals used in J&J; products are safe, she also says her company is trying to respond to the concerns of its customers. J&J; has even created a website dedicated to this transition to new product formulations, many of which will take place even sooner than 2015, at least in products designed for children and babies. The site, entitled Our Safety & Care Commitment , explains how the company will eventually phase out phthalates, triclosan, parabens, fragrances, and many other questionable chemicals from its product lines in years to come. 'We've never really seen a major personal care product company take the kind of move that they're taking with this,' said Kenneth A. Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), about J&J;'s decision to be an industry leader in this particular area. Cook even expressed a bit of surprise that a company as large as J&J; has decided to take on the incredible, and quite costly, task of reformulating even its signature formulas, to which many people have grown accustomed. In the process of phasing out its questionable ingredients, J&J; says it plans to conduct extensive research on potential alternative ingredients to ensure their safety. When all is said and done, only a few J&J; products will still contain trace levels of formaldehyde and 1,4 dioxane, as well as certain fragrance chemicals. Most J&J; products; however, will eventually be free of phthalates, triclosan, parabens, and formaldehyde. 'We want to share our policies and plans in a forum that is designed to help consumers better understand what we do to ensure that the products they choose are as safe as can be,' added Nettesheim.

0," The advance of robotics in recent years has been incredible and is now about to enter a new era, according to reports. Indeed, 'humanoid' types of robots are expected to hit American retailers sometime next year. Bloomberg News reports that billionaire Masayoshi Son will begin selling a kind of humanoid robot named 'Pepper' by summer 2015 at Sprint Corp. stories in the United States, which is part of a push by SoftBank Corp. to move the technology beyond the factory. In addition, SoftBank says it has received nearly 400 inquiries about its humanoid robot from companies in finance, food service and education, said Fumihide Tomizawa, chief executive officer of SoftBank Robotics, in an interview with Bloomberg News . The 1.2-meter (4-foot) robot 'dances, makes jokes and estimates human emotions based on expressions,' the news service reported. Pepper will be on sale in Japan in February for about $1,900; the company has yet to set a price for it in the U.S. 'We want to build a society that coexists with robots' Last year, SoftBank paid $22 billion for control of Sprint; now, the company has begun to invest in robotics as Japan looks to double the value of its current domestic production to 2.41 trillion yen ($22.9 billion) by 2020. The company has developed an operating system that can control robots much the same as Google's Android software can run a smartphone. Its platform is able to be customized so it can be used in a range of industries including construction, healthcare and entertainment. 'We will sell Pepper in the United States within a year after gathering information in Japan,' Tomizawa told Bloomberg News . 'I won't be surprised if Pepper sales will be half to business and half to consumers.' In July, SoftBank Robotics was launched as a subsidiary to direct the company's business and begin selling Pepper; the robot comes equipped with a laser sensor and a battery that can last up to 12 hours. As further reported by Bloomberg News : The robot was initially targeted at families and the elderly before getting attention for business use since its June unveiling. Tomizawa declined to specify the company's sales targets for robotics. SoftBank expects to generate revenue through applications and original content as customers personalize their robots. 'The basic premise is to produce profit,' Tomizawa said. 'Son is aggressively involved in the project and we report to him one or two times a month.' In 2010, Son described his vision for the future: Create a society where humans coexist with intelligent robots. He has also said that Pepper is a result of time he has spent watching the television show Astro Boy , a cartoon series in the 1960s based on a character who could not experience emotions. In July, Son said he believes that he can improve labor productivity by replacing 90 million jobs with one-third as many robots. 'We could enter the robot business for industrial use in the mid or long term,' Tomizawa explained. China ramping up production too SoftBank's robot development coincides with robotics companies acquired recently by Google, including Schaft Inc., a Tokyo-based company that manufactures two-legged humanoid robots . Other robot firms include Honda Motor Co., which has developed a robot that plays soccer, and Panasonic Corp. Meanwhile, in neighboring China, robotics production is ramping up as well. According to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, the country's first industrial robot line should begin operation this month in the northeastern city of Shenyang, officials said. The Saisun Robot and Automation Co. Ltd. 'will be the first to jump start China's industrial robot production with an annual capacity of 5,000,' the news agency reported. In 2013, China became the world's largest industrial robot market, with 37,000 units sold. That was 20 percent of the global market.

0," (Republished from VaccineImpact.com ) The December 2014 report from the Department of Justice on damages paid by the U.S. Government to vaccine victims was recently published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources. There were 180 cases of vaccine injuries decided. 134 cases received compensation, while 46 cases were denied. Most of the U.S. public is unaware that a U.S. citizen, by law, cannot sue a pharmaceutical company for damages resulting from vaccines. Congress gave them total legal immunity in 1986, and that law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. There is a special 'vaccine court' called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that is funded through a tax on vaccines. If you are injured or killed by a vaccine, you must hire an attorney and fight tax-funded government attorneys to seek damages, as you cannot sue the drug manufacturers. As you can see from the report below, it can take years to reach a settlement. Therefore, this report probably only represents a tiny fraction of the actual number of people harmed or killed by vaccines, since it is so difficult to fight the government in court to win a settlement. This report clearly shows that the flu vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine in America. 134 cases were awarded settlements for vaccine injuries, with 79 of the settlements being for the flu shot, including three deaths. Most of the settlements for injuries due to the flu shot were for Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Other flu vaccine injuries included: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, shingles (herpes zoster), neuropathic demyelination, seizures, neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, optic neuritis, and Bell's palsy. You didn't read about this in your local or national news, did you? Here are copies of the actual report: Hundreds of People are Afflicted with Guillain-Barre Syndrome Every Year from the Flu Shot As can be seen in this report and other reports of government payments for vaccine injuries, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most common side effect and injury due to the flu vaccination. What is Guillain-Barre Syndrome? Here is the definition the CDC [1] gives: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder in which a person's own immune system damages their nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks. Most people recover fully from GBS, but some people have permanent nerve damage. In very rare cases, people have died of GBS, usually from difficulty breathing. Compare this to the CDC [2] definition for Polio: Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus that lives in the throat and intestinal tract. Up to about 72% of susceptible persons infected with polio have no symptoms. However, infected persons without symptoms can still spread the virus and cause others to develop polio. About 24% of infected susceptible persons have minor symptoms such as fever, sore throat, upset stomach, or flu-like symptoms and have no paralysis or other serious symptoms. About 1-5% develop aseptic meningitis with stiffness of the back or legs, and in some persons increased or abnormal sensations a few days after the minor illness resolves. These symptoms typically last from two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. Less than 1% of polio cases result in paralysis of the limbs (usually the legs). Of those cases resulting in paralysis, 5-10% of the patients die when the respiratory muscles are paralyzed. Here is one story of a man who nearly died from GBS [3] resulting from a flu shot, and here is a recent story of a nurse who was awarded $11.6 million after being paralyzed by the flu shot. [4] The fact that GBS is one of the side effects of the annual flu vaccine is well known and documented. The package inserts [5] of flu vaccines even lists a warning regarding GBS: 'If Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give AFLURIA should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.' Did you know that? Are you screened and asked questions prior to receiving a flu vaccine to see if you have any risks based on pre-existing conditions? How many people are injured with GBS due to a flu shot? According to the CDC, [6] 'no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated.' Is this rate accurate? We don't know. How many people might be afflicted with GBS and not make the connection to the flu vaccine? The CDC states [7] that 'an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS each year,' and 'about two-thirds of people who develop GBS symptoms do so several days or weeks after they have been sick with diarrhea or a respiratory illness.' Let's assume the government's estimate of GBS injuries due to flu vaccines is accurate (1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated). How many people does that translate to who are becoming injured (or killed) by GBS as a result of the flu vaccine? According to the latest statistics (December 2014) listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services here, [8] there were about 944 million doses of the flu vaccine distributed between 2006 and 2013. So by the government's own statistics, the flu vaccine is causing about 269 people per year to become injured (including some deaths) with GBS. This is out of 3,000 to 6,000 cases of GBS in the U.S. per year. Could vaccines actually be responsible for a lot more? RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Is the Flu Vaccine even Effective, and Worth the Risk? This is the big question that needs to be answered to justify mass vaccinations and documented lives destroyed by the flu vaccine. Those marketing and pushing for the flu vaccine want you to believe that the minority need to be sacrificed for the greater good of the majority, and that the flu vaccine is effective. Earlier this week (first week of December 2014), the CDC announced that this year's influenza vaccine was not a good match for this season's viruses. (See: CDC: Current Flu Vaccine Not a Good Match for This Season's Viruses, Ineffective [9] ) But even in seasons when there is supposedly a 'good match,' is there evidence that the flu vaccine is effective? Is this a scientific fact, or simply a belief to support a billion dollar vaccine industry that cannot be sued for damages? The media and most medical professionals often state that the flu causes anywhere from '3,000 to 49,000 deaths each year.' The CDC's website, [10] however, states that this is just an estimate, and that they actually do not even know what this number is. Actual text from the CDC website[11] regarding flu deaths (as of 7/18/2014). Lawrence Solomon, the research director of Consumer Policy Institute[12] in Canada, wrote an article earlier this year in the Huffington Post questioning the accuracy of the CDC's estimates: The numbers differ wildly from the sober tallies recorded on death certificates -- by law every certificate must show a cause -- and reported by the official agencies that collect and keep vital statistics. According to the National Vital Statistics System[13] in the U.S., for example, annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year - fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743). Even that 500 figure for the U.S. could be too high, according to analyses in authoritative journals such as the American Journal of Public Health[14] and the British Medical Journal. Only about 15-20] percent of people who come down with flu-like symptoms have the influenza virus -- the other 80-85 per cent actually caught rhinovirus or other germs that are indistinguishable from the true flu without laboratory tests, which are rarely done. In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only 18 were positively identified as true flu. The other 239 were simply assumed to be the flu and most likely had few true flu cases among them. The CDC's decision to play up flu deaths dates back a decade, when it realized the public wasn't following its advice on the flu vaccine. During the 2003 flu season, 'the manufacturers were telling us that they weren't receiving a lot of orders for vaccine,' Dr. Glen Nowak, associate director for communications at CDC's National Immunization Program, told National Public Radio. 'It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot.' The CDC's response was its 'Seven-Step 'Recipe'[15] for Generating Interest in, and Demand for, Flu (or any other) Vaccination,' a slide show Nowak presented at the 2004 National Influenza Vaccine Summit. The CDC unabashedly decided to create a mass market for the flu vaccine by enlisting the media into panicking the public. An obedient and unquestioning media obliged by hyping the numbers, and 10 years later it is obliging still. (Source.)[16] Many Doctors and Nurses Oppose Mass Vaccination There is growing opposition in the healthcare field to mass flu vaccination. However, the pharmaceutical lobby is very powerful, exerting great influence over medical colleges and universities, as well as using politicians to accomplish their goals. This includes mandatory flu vaccination policies increasingly being put into place at healthcare facilities as a requirement to get full reimbursement of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Understanding the risks involved in taking a flu shot, many healthcare professionals, particularly in the nursing field, are refusing mandatory flu vaccines even at the risk of losing their employment. (See: Nurses Across the U.S. are Taking a Stand Against Forced Flu Vaccines [16] and Doctors Against Mandated Flu Vaccines. [17] ) In the video above, Dr. Mark Geier explains the fraud behind the flu vaccine. Dr. Geier is NOT anti-vaccine. He is an MD and has a PhD in genetics. He spent 10 years working at the National Institute of Health, and was a professor at Johns Hopkins University as a geneticist. He is also the author of over 150 peer-reviewed publications. He worked on vaccine safety and efficacy for more than 30 years. He was one of four scientists who worked to replace the DTP vaccine, a vaccine that caused every child to become sick with a high fever at the time of vaccination, with the DTaP vaccine, which is a more purified vaccine and causes illness due to fever in only 3% of those vaccinated. In the video above, he explains that the flu shot causes Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and that the flu shot is not very effective in preventing the flu. He also explains that the CDC does not follow the law for vaccines in requiring long-term safety testing for the influenza vaccine like they do with other vaccines, as it is impossible to test a vaccine that changes every year. So the flu vaccine is basically an experimental vaccine that they want to give out to 300 million people every year. There are also no studies showing the safety of giving the flu vaccine to the same person every single year. However, Dr. Geier points out that the CDC is in the business of distributing flu vaccines, because they represent 300 million doses per year, whereas all the childhood vaccines together only number 20 million. Dr. Geier goes on to explain that flu is 'the wrong thing to vaccinate against' because you have to keep revaccinating against it every year, unlike childhood infectious diseases, such as smallpox, that are only vaccinated for once. Dr. Geier points out how ridiculous it is spend billions of dollars on a vaccine that might, at its best, save about 50 lives a year, when there are far more serious problems causing death which are more worthy of that kind of expenditure. Be informed, don't become a statistic of those damaged or killed by the flu vaccine! There are many other less dangerous ways to protect oneself from influenza. Read more at VaccineImpact.com .

Here's the tour information: The Amazon Wild Foods and Medicinal Plants Adventure Imagine walking through the rainforests of Ecuador, surrounded by medicinal plants and wild foods. Harmonies of birds and locusts blanket the forest from lush treetops. Your group pauses for a moment to take it all in... that's when you discover you're standing right next to a sacred Sangre de Drago tree, rich with natural medicine, standing five stories tall with a gorgeous canopy of leaves shaped like hearts. Your group guide makes a small incision on the tree bark and the medicine begins to flow: It's an anti-cancer tree sap, made of 90% proanthocyanidins. It's been used by the Shuar Indians as living medicine for centuries and now you're getting to taste it fresh, raw and wild, right off the tree... This scene isn't fiction. I experienced it myself last December as part of an eco-tourism mission I've taken on to help promote ecological tourism throughout Ecuador . As you'll soon see, you can experience this too because it's all part of an adventure tour being offered by an Ecuadorian-owned company based in Vilcabamba. I was invited as a guest to go on a preview of this tour, and what I experienced was truly breathtaking: Hikes through the national forest, the identification and sampling of wild herbs, and the tasting of all varieties of exotic wild foods that I never even knew existed. This tour, called the 'Amazon Wild Foods and Medicinal Plants Adventure,' promises five days of adventure in Ecuador that you'll remember for a lifetime. Keep reading below to learn more.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) How we eat may be just as important as what we eat. The diets eaten by most Americans are based on the belief that any number of different foods can be digested at the same time. This belief may be why more than half the population suffers from some sort of digestive distress for which there seems to be no remedy. As sales of antacids soar off the charts, maybe it's time to rediscover the art of food combining. Indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome are modern phenomena Our ancestors did not eat the way we do. Their diets were composted of one or two foods at a time as they came across them, with many meals consisting of nothing but animal protein. With the advent of agriculture, a more varied diet became available, but it was still based mainly on the consumption of meat, and dairy products. Vegetables and fruits were available only in their season, with the exception of a few root vegetables that could be stored. The food processing so taken for granted today had not yet been invented, and processed carbohydrates were not a part of the diet. Rolaids hadn't been invented either, and it appears that our ancestors did not suffer from the digestive problems so prevalent in modern times. Dr. Hay used theory of food combining to regain his own health The art of food combining is the brain child of Dr. William Hay who after several years of medical practice found his own health in shambles. Suffering from high blood pressure, heart disease and weight gain, he decided to take a close look not only at what he was eating but how he was eating it. His discoveries and dietary changes brought him remission of symptoms and reduction of weight by 50 pounds in just a few months. And like most theorists who have come up with an idea that really benefits people, Dr. Hay was ridiculed by his peers. Today, the scientific community is finding evidence that Dr. Hay was onto something. Research is showing a connection between carbohydrates and allergies, diabetes, skin problems, migraines, depression, chronic fatigue, and psychiatric disorders. Food combining reflects the principles governing digestion The theory of food combining is based on the idea that good health results from a body that is slightly alkaline and attuned to the basic principles of digestion. It is a scientifically based system of selecting foods that are compatible from all that are available. By grouping the right foods together people can be assured of effortless digestion and more complete assimilation and use of nutrients by the body. When foods are correctly combined, nutrients from them can be used to their fullest extent to promote good health. Digestion is facilitated by juices and enzymes produced in response to a cue from the food that has been eaten. The juices can be alkaline or acid depending on the requirement of the enzymes they contain. These enzymes are active only in a suitable media with well defined acid-alkaline ranges. They are destroyed by variation in those ranges. Carbohydrate foods stimulate the secretion of enzymes made specifically to break down carbohydrates, while protein foods require the secretion of enzymes made specifically to break down protein. Fats too have specific enzymes needs to facilitate their breakdown. For example, the salivary enzyme, amylase, is produced in response to eating carbohydrates, and its job is to break down carbohydrates for digestion. Amylase is only active in an alkaline medium and is destroyed by a mildly acidic environment. The gastric enzyme, pepsin, is produced in response to eating protein, and its job is to break down protein for digestion. Pepsin is only active in an acid medium and is destroyed in an alkaline environment. While the body will produce juices and enzymes specific to any type of food that has been eaten, it is unable to do so when a variety of foods are eaten together. According to Dr. Hay, it is the combining at the same time of foods requiring both acid and alkaline medium for digestion that is responsible for 90 percent of digestive problems. Good digestive outcome requires meals comprised of similar food types When foods are improperly combined, fermentation in the digestive tract and digestive distress is the likely outcome. When foods eaten at a meal are of the same type, there is no fermentation and proper digestion is allowed to take place. The best way to avoid fermentation is to avoid mixing high protein foods with high carbohydrate foods. While almost every food contains some amount of protein, those with high concentration of protein remain in the stomach for several hours while the gastric juices and enzymes do their work. Depending on the complexity of the protein eaten, this time can be up to six hours. Here are the basic rules of food combining: Number one: Protein and carbohydrate concentrated foods Breakdown of protein requires an acid medium, and digestion of protein dense animal products requires high levels of hydrochloric acid. Since digestion of carbohydrate dense foods requires an alkaline medium in order to be broken down, high carbohydrate foods that have been mixed with high protein foods will not digest but will sit there fermenting, producing indigestion, bloating and gas. And since this fermentation of carbohydrates will inhibit the digestion of the protein, more gas, bloating and discomfort will be produced. This makes the typical American meal, composed of a large hunk of meat along with potatoes and bread, a recipe for digestive disaster. Dr. Hay's research found that most protein foods are best digested when accompanied by a fresh green salad. Other concentrated protein foods like nuts and seeds combine well with acid fruits such as oranges, pineapples blackberries, or strawberries. They also work fairly well with sub-acid fruits such as apples, cherries, mangos, or peaches. The vitamin C in these fruits aids digestion of the mixture. Number two: Eating two concentrated proteins together Each type of protein requires a specific character, strength and timing of digestive juice secretions. This means that no two types of concentrated protein should be consumed together at a meal. Nuts, meat, eggs, cheese, or other protein foods should not be eaten together. And no two types of animal protein should be eaten together, a rule that may be hard to swallow by the surf and turf crowd. Number three: Protein and fats Fats inhibit the secretion of gastric juices needed to digest meat, fish, dairy products, nuts, and eggs by as much as fifty percent. When fat concentrated foods are eaten with protein concentrated foods, the digestive breakdown of the fats is delayed until gastric juices complete their work on the complex proteins. This means fats will remain undigested in the stomach for a long period of time. Although some high protein foods also contain high amounts of fat, these fats will be held in suspension awaiting breakdown without impeding gastric action. However, free fats such as oil, butter and milk fat will coat the gastric mucosa, inhibiting gastric juice. This is why fried chicken is so hard to digest. Number four: Acid fruits with carbohydrates The enzyme in saliva that begins the breakdown of starch concentrated foods in the mouth does the important job of converting complex starch molecules into more simple sugars. In order to work, the enzyme requires a neutral or slightly alkaline medium, the natural condition found in the mouth. When acid foods are eaten, the action of the enzyme needed to break down starch is halted because the medium needed has been altered. Thus acid fruits should not be eaten at the same meal as sweet fruits or other starches. This combination is what makes spaghetti and other dishes combining tomatoes with starch so bloating. Number five: Acid fruits with protein Oranges, tomatoes, lemons, pineapples and other acid fruits can be easily digested and produce no distress when eaten away from starchy and protein foods. However, when included in a meal that contains a protein concentrated food, the acid fruits seriously hamper protein digestion. This is in part what makes the typical American breakfast of orange juice, bacon, eggs and toast such a digestive nightmare Number six: Starch and sugar Eating starches that have been disguised as sweets is not a good way to eat starch. Although the 'treat' produces an abundance of saliva, the saliva contains none of the enzyme needed to digest the starch because the sugar has turned the environment acidic. This is why such items as fruit filled Danish settle on the digestive tract like a sack of bricks. The carbohydrates are fermenting in the body, producing noxious gases. Number seven: Consuming melons Melons should not be consumed with any other foods. Watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and the more exotic melons should always be eaten away from mealtime and alone. Melons are meant to decompose quickly in the digestive system, which is what they will do if there is no interfering with the process. Number eight: Consuming milk Milk is best left to babies who traditionally consume it alone, away from other foods. Milk does not digest in the stomach, but in the duodenum, so the presence of milk in the stomach does not promote secretion of gastric juice. The use of acid fruits with milk does not cause any digestive difficulty, although the benefits of the antioxidant potential of the fruits may be lost due to the affinity they have for the protein in milk. The goal of food combining is digestive bliss If all this seems overwhelming, especially at first, here is the bottom line. Starches, fats, and green vegetables may be eaten together as they require either an alkaline or neutral medium for their digestion. Similarly, protein foods, green vegetables, sugars and acid fruits may be eaten together as they require an acid or neutral medium for their digestion. Starches and proteins, fats and proteins, proteins and acid fruits, starch and acid fruits, and starch and sugars should not be eaten together for those people looking to attain optimal digestion and gastric comfort. Meals that contain the smallest number of courses will produce better digestive results. A one course meal is ideal. As a general rule, simple meals are more conducive to good health than are more elaborate meals, no matter how much attention the person planning the meal has devoted to food combining. As the typical American meal consisting of protein, carbohydrates and fats may remain in the stomach for up to six hours, the potential is there for several hours of digestive misery. And remember, carbohydrates are always the last to be digested. If another meal is eaten before the first one has completely digested, the protein is again digested first, leaving the carbohydrates to be stored as fat. This is why weight loss is a secondary benefit to food combining. When foods are properly combined, they are not stored in a line waiting to be digested. On the other hand, carbohydrates eaten without proteins remain in the stomach for about one hour or even less. A fruit meal remains in the stomach for an even shorter period of time. The ideal regimen of food combining would be a fruit meal for breakfast, a starch meal with a vegetable salad or non-starchy vegetables for lunch, and a protein meal with a salad and non-starch vegetables for dinner.

0," A variety of health issues can arise from bowel irregularity; for this reason, it's best to regularly evacuate the colon. The accumulation of fecal matter in the bowel creates an ideal environment for parasites and bacteria to proliferate. This can create or further exacerbate bowel issues such as diarrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticulitis. Constipation can increase your chances of developing candida, an overgrowth of yeast. Additionally, some parasites, such as roundworm, can contribute to intestinal blockage due to their size. While pharmaceutical laxatives are commonly sought out to remedy constipation, they can be harsh on the colon, create dependency, decrease the colon's ability to contract, deplete the body of minerals and damage the nerves, muscles and tissues of the colon. The following three herbs can be used as remedies for constipation and can also help keep the bowels regular. Aloe Vera The outer leaf of the aloe vera plant contains strong laxative properties. Constipation can be remedied by blending a small piece of aloe, spiky tips removed, and drinking the juice once a day. The clear gel, found inside the aloe leaf, may help promote bowel regularity and may also be used to remedy constipation. The inner portion of the aloe leaf is milder and generally safer to use than the outer part of the leaf that contains the strong laxative compounds. Adverse side effects have been reported when using the outer portion of the leaf, so try using the inside portion first. Aloe can also help soothe and repair stomach ulcers, damaged intestinal tissue and inflammation. Ginger Ginger is an antiseptic, mild laxative and a stimulant. It promotes bowel regularity by improving digestion and stimulating the muscles of the bowel to move matter along. Its mild laxative properties make ginger a great herbal remedy for constipation . The amount of ginger consumed can be increased to create a slightly stronger laxative effect, in cases of constipation, without the negative side effects of pharmaceuticals. Ginger also strengthens the stomach, aids digestion and stimulates appetite, according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. According to a study published in Cancer Prevention Research , ginger reduced markers of colon inflammation and 'may have potential as a colon cancer prevention agent.' The study showed that 2 grams of ginger extract daily, over a period of 28 days, was able to reduce pro-eicosanoids in the colon . Keep bowel movements regular and improve digestion by drinking 2 teaspoons (1 gram) of freshly grated or powdered ginger in 8 ounces of hot water. In times of constipation, drink 2 to 3 cups of ginger tea per day. Slippery Elm Slippery elm contains mucilage -- a thick glue-like substance produced by most plants -- that is beneficial against gastrointestinal inflammation. Slippery elm has been used by Native Americans for centuries. The Native Americans made salves out of it to heal wounds, burns, ulcers, boils and skin inflammation. Taken orally, it can also help relieve diarrhea, stomach issues, coughs and sore throats. A salve can be made by mixing powdered slippery elm with water, stirring it and letting it sit. You'll notice that it will start to thicken and take on a gel-like consistency. Its mucilaginous property soothes the stomach and intestines. Slippery elm also contains antioxidants that help fight inflammation of the bowel. Additionally, it promotes reflux stimulation of nerve endings in the gastrointestinal tract that leads to an increase in mucus secretion, which protects against excessive acidity and ulcers. This is a a great 'all-purpose' herb, because it's effective for constipation and equally for diarrhea, helps regulate the bowel, and heals and soothes irritated tissue in the gastrointestinal tract.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created through an inexact science of shooting genes spliced from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals or humans with a .22 caliber pistol into the DNA of plants or animals laced with a metal such as tungsten. This unsafe science ostensibly supplants millions of years of evolution with little or no scientific justification. In fact, recent research on GMO crops have reported yields to be between 4 to 20 percent less than conventional crops [1-6]. In the 1970's when genetic engineered was pioneered, scientists believed the genome was static and genes could be altered in a uniform manner with the organism only expressing the one intended modification. As research progressed in the 1980's, scientists scrapped the idea of the static genome and moved towards a dynamic genomic belief model. This came about from the realization that by inserting a new gene into a plant, a cascade of unintended consequences arose. Scientists found that there was no possible way to introduce a new gene into an organism and only get one intended result. The genes quickly changed based on a myriad of unknown circumstances that sometimes could not be repeated in the lab even though the exact same procedures were used. The levels of instability from these newly created organisms were overwhelming, but many scientists were silenced. Safety has always been the number one priority of consumers when it comes to GMOs; antithetically, the seed companies' only priority has been to increase profits at any expense. Therefore, it is no surprise that objective and unbiased researchers have recently added to the growing knowledge of the realities of the increased instability and unintended consequences regarding the long-term safety of GMOs . These researchers recently found clear links among the consumption of GM-corn and decreased fertility, immunological alterations in the gut and the exacerbation and creation of allergies. Fertility in GM-Fed Mice Scientists in Austria recently conducted the first ever long-term multi-generational feeding study of Monsanto's genetically modified (GM) corn (NK 603 x MON 810) in mice [7]. The study consisted of two groups: an experimental group, which was fed a 33% GM corn (maize) feed, and a control group, which was fed an equivalent non-GM corn feed. The mice were allowed to live a natural life and were monitored for four generations. Scientists recorded organ weight, gene expression, body mass, metabolism, life span and number of offspring of both groups of mice. The scientists found that mice fed GM corn had significantly less pups per litter than the control group on the third and fourth generation. Furthermore, pups whose parents were fed GM-feed weighed less at birth and at weaning and experienced significantly higher mortality rates than those fed non-GM corn. Lead author of the study Professor Zentek reported that there was a direct link between the decrease in fertility and the GM diet and mice fed non-GM corn reproduced more efficiently. Gene Expression in GM-Fed Mice Using a microarray analysis, the scientists reported that 1016 genes had been differentially expressed in the mice fed GM corn with most being up-regulated. Essentially, the GM-fed mice had hundreds of their proteins, which are encoded by genes, expressed in an increased or decreased quantity, which as a corollary altered certain biological processes in their bodies. For example, sensory perception, ion transport and the ability to breakdown proteins (proteolysis) were down-regulated or under-expressed, while the ability of the mice to regulate T-cells (a primary immunological response especially in fighting cancer), circadian rhythm regulation and the FAS signalling pathway (which is a major pathway for cell apoptosis and is important in the elimination of cancers) were over-expressed. This study elucidates the fact that biologic damage from GMOs may not manifest until the third generation and details strong evidence for the mandatory labelling, and even more so for the mass extinction, of these highly dangerous and unnecessary foods. Immunological Reactions in GM Fed Mice Italian researchers at the National Institute of Nutrition in Rome, Italy, recently published a study examining the effects of a 50 percent GM-corn (maize) diet on the intestinal immune response of mice [8]. The GM-corn was known as Monsanto's transgenic MON810 and was created using an inserted foreign DNA sequence from the bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) designed to protect against a fungus known as the Fusarium species. The study was conducted over 30 and 90-day periods respectively, with mice from two groups, weaning age (mean of 21 days) and old age (mean of 15 months). The study evaluated the peripheral and intestinal immune response to long-term GM-corn and non-GM corn consumption of each group across the two periods. The young and old mice were used because of the lack of research on these subsets as well as their potential susceptibility to immunological changes, more so than non-aged adult animals. The results of the long-term study revealed significant changes in the immunophenotype of the gut, spleen, circulating lymphocytes and the level of serum cytokines of the mice fed GM-corn. Immunophenotyping essentially determines the expression of proteins by the cells. Any differences in the expression of proteins between the control and the experimental groups would be attributable to the GM diet. Specifically, the researchers found an increased presence of several cytokines in the GM fed mice, which are specifically involved in inflammatory and allergic responses by the body. The researchers also found an increase in the protein expression of lymphocytes (TCR+ population). Within this population, the T cells reside in the gut and are associated with regulatory elements of the immune response, specific to infectious agents [9-11]. Elevated amounts T cells have been found in asthmatics, children suffering from food allergies, gastrointestinal symptoms and juvenile arthritis [12]. The GM-fed mice also exhibited significant alterations in the number of T and B cells, indicating a significantly abnormal immune response to the genetically altered feed. Furthermore, other researchers have found a newly expressed protein from the consumption of GM corn (50 kDa -zein), which is a widely known allergenic protein [13]. In conclusion, from the newly presented research it is apparent that ingesting genetically engineered BT corn not only invokes an anaphylaxis (allergenic) response within the body, it also deregulates several proteins, inhibits fertility and alters the overall immunological response by the body. Clearly, Monsanto whose sole goal is to control the world through food, has a lot of explaining to do. References 1. Benbrook, C.M. (1999).

0," A Michigan mother's painful journey to find answers to her son's mysterious death has unearthed yet another case of vaccine-induced early mortality. The untimely fate of Elijah Daniel French, who was born on May 4, 2007, and died just days after receiving eight routine vaccinations in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s recommended vaccine schedule, has been determined by a child death investigator and several pathologists to have been caused by the vaccines. As originally reported by VacTruth.com (and archived here ), young Danny's (as his parents called him) heartbreaking story begins like many others: He was completely healthy, smiling and normal until being jabbed by establishment white-coats with multiple government-recommended vaccines all at once. He quickly digressed into poor health, almost immediately suffering from breathing problems and high fever. According to the family's account, Daniel was vaccinated for seven different conditions at five-and-a-half months old, including with DTaP, hepatitis B, polio, Hib and pneumococcal vaccines. Despite suffering immediate adverse effects, Daniel was brought back to the doctor's office just a few months later and jabbed again with all the same vaccines. This time his condition worsened, and he quickly developed asthma. Believing that her child's doctor knew what was best, Daniel's mother brought him back for a third round of vaccines at 14 months old. This time, the boy was given eight vaccines in four separate injections: MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), Hib, varicella and DTaP. This is when things for Daniel took a serious turn for the worse. 'That night, Danny was still eating and drinking but was cranky and slept more than usual,' his mother reported. 'By the next day, he was extremely fatigued, irritable and had a loss of appetite. He did not have a fever at this time. He was red and warm where they injected him. These symptoms only worsened.' 'By the third day, Danny was unable to stay awake for longer than thirty minutes, he had zero food intake, his fluid intake diminished and he cried excessively. Seventy-one hours after his doctor visit, Danny developed a fever from the vaccines and was given Children's Tylenol. His doctor was called but there was no answer from him because it was the July 4th holiday, the office was closed.' Three independent pathologists confirm that young Danny's death was caused by vaccines Long story short, Danny fell asleep not long after being given another round of Children's Tylenol, and when his mother came back a few hours later to check on him, his body was cold and unresponsive: Young Danny had died. And the cause of death, as Danny's mother would only find out years later after conducting her own thorough investigation, was the vaccines he was given. The initial autopsy report declared that Danny had died from asphyxia in an undetermined manner, but the boy's mother wasn't satisfied with this explanation. She soon discovered that the official death report noted acetaminophen from the Tylenol in Danny's blood, but nothing from the vaccines, pointing to a cover-up. As it turns out, the medical examiner involved was bent against implicating vaccines as a possible cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Danny's mother decided to consult with other medical experts to gain second opinions, and what they all unanimously determined is that, based on blood and tissue samples taken from Danny's body, the boy had definitely died from the vaccines. 'Everything was reviewed by three separate pathologists ,' she said. 'All three confirmed the same findings. The pathologists stated vaccine-induced hypercytokinemia as the cause of my son's asphyxiation. They were able to determine this in large part to the blood panel taken prior to Danny receiving his vaccines, in contrast with the samples I had stored.' 'They also agreed encephalopathy was likely responsible, as it's a cytokine storm syndrome. Danny's pathology report stated his cause of death was asphyxiation, secondary to hypercytokinemia, caused by vaccines received approximately 72 hours prior.'

0," Tweet Nerve cells that normally are not light sensitive in the retinas of blind mice can respond to light when a green algae protein called channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is inserted into the cell membranes, according to a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported study published in the April 6, 2006 issue of the journal Neuron. The study was conducted with mice that had been genetically bred to lose rods and cones, the light-sensitive cells in the retina. This condition is similar to the blinding disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans. Vision normally begins when rods and cones, also called photoreceptors, respond to light and send signals through the retina and the optic nerve to the visual cortex of the brain, where visual images are formed. Unfortunately, photoreceptors degenerate and die in some genetic diseases, such as RP. Both mice and humans go progressively blind because with the loss of rods and cones there is no signal sent to the brain. This study, funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the NIH, raises the intriguing possibility that visual function might be restored by conveying light-sensitive properties to other surviving cells in the retina after the rods and cones have died. Principal investigator Zhuo-Hua Pan, Ph.D., of Wayne State University School of Medicine, and his colleagues, using a gene-transfer approach, introduced the light-absorbing protein ChR2 into the mouse retinal cells that survived after the rods and cones had died. These cells became light sensitive and sent signals through the optic nerve to the visual cortex. This innovative gene-transfer approach is certainly compelling, said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of vision research at the NIH. This is a clever approach that offers the possibility of some extent of vision restoration at some time in the future. In addition to RP, there are many forms of retinal degenerative eye diseases that possibly could be treated by gene-based therapies. The researchers determined that the signals reached the visual cortex in a majority of the ChR2-treated mice. The light sensitivity persisted for at least six months. Did the mice regain usable vision? Probably not, but the investigators suggest a number of technical improvements to their experiments which might make that possible. This study demonstrates the feasibility of restoring visual responses in mice after they lose the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, said Dr. Pan. He and his colleague, Alexander Dizhoor, Ph.D., of Pennsylvania College of Optometry, another of the study authors, think that expressing ChR2 in other types of retinal cells may help to improve this approach. In addition, the authors state it would be interesting for further study to modify the light sensitivity and/or wavelength selectivity of ChR2, or use similar microbial proteins, to produce diverse light-sensitive channels to improve outcomes for the possible restoration of normal vision. The National Eye Institute (NEI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is the Federal government's lead agency for vision research that leads to sight-saving treatments and plays a key role in reducing visual impairment and blindness.

0," The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) recently announced plans to limit the use of a widely used fumigant responsible for mass poisonings. Chloropicrin, an inherently dangerous pesticide, was formerly used as a weapon during World War I. Capable of penetrating gas masks, the chemical induced vomiting, causing the enemy to rip off their masks, thus exposing themselves to other deadly chemicals. After the war ended, America was left with an overabundance of chloropicrin, prompting officials to seek out a new use for the lethal chemical. Named by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a 'lung damaging agent,' chloropicrin became an important tool for the agricultural industry as farmers discovered the chemical's ability to effectively kill nematodes, certain fungi and nearly everything else in the soil, including beneficial organisms. Part of DPR's new regulations on chloropicrin [PDF] include larger buffer zones, better notification systems and a reduction in the amount of acreage that can be sprayed daily by the fumigant. California cracks down on chloropicrin use, doubling buffer zones and improving notification systems Chloropicrin is applied either through soil injection or drip irrigation. Tarps are typically used to cover treated areas in order to reduce chemical drift; however, this method is not always effective, as it's resulted in numerous mass poisoning events. Farm workers and citizens residing in nearby neighborhoods are often the victims of such pesticide drifts. Under California's new regulations, buffer zones for chloropicrin have been increased; in some cases, they're double the size of those enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The new buffer zones apply when Totally Impermeable Film (TIF) tarps are not used, a tool that sounds good but is susceptible to being torn or blown out of place, according to Ann Katten, a pesticide and work safety specialist with the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation. California's old regulations required the minimum buffer zone for chloropicrin to be 25 feet; today it's 25-100 feet, depending on whether or not a tarp is used, and if so, what type of tarp is used. The field size for which the fumigant can be applied has also been reduced. While the EPA allows 160 acres to be spayed daily, California set the limit to 40 acres a day; however, if TIF tarps are used, farmers can spray up to 60 acres a day. Currently, nearby homes and businesses are provided with a warning in English before fumigant application; that same warning will now also be issued in Spanish. California's new rules require growers to provide the local county agricultural commissioner with details of upcoming fumigation at least 48 hours in advance, compared to a previously mandated 24-hour notice. Chloropicrin use skyrocketed over the last two decades While 70 percent of chloropicrin is used to treat strawberry fields, farmers planting other crops including raspberries, melons, peppers, tomatoes and nuts such as almonds, pistachios and walnuts also rely heavily on the fumigant. When farmers first started using chloropicrin on strawberry fields in the 1950s, their production spiked unnaturally, allowing Americans to consume four times more strawberries than previously! Since then, the application of fumigants has skyrocketed. In California, the use of chloropicrin rose 650 percent from 1991 to 2012, according to the state's pesticide data. Over the years, several incidents of chloropicrin poisoning have occurred. In October 2005, at lest 300 people, including paramedics, were poisoned by the chemical when a strawberry field a quarter-mile away was fumigated in Salinas, California. Two years earlier, a plume of chloropicrin drifted into the nearby community of Lamont after being applied to an onion field, poisoning 150 residents. Fumigants have been tied to a multitude of health effects including cancer, respiratory damage, neurological problems, convulsions and tremors.

0," Popular science journal PLOS ONE recently published a comprehensive study led by Chinese researchers. The study mapped out and detailed the intricate design and inner workings of the human hand. That study has now been retracted, all because of one word. The authors of the study used the word Creator to describe the 'connective architecture' of the hand. The objective paper, titled 'Biomechanical Characteristics of Hand Coordination in Grasping Activities of Daily Living,' passed PLOS ONE 's initial editing process. However, after the word Creator was brought to the editor's attention, the study was quickly retracted. PLOS ONE immediately apologized to the scientific community and the world for publishing the forbidden word. Social media erupted with hashtag #CreatorGate . Present-day science has become intellectually intolerant, censoring beliefs, acting as thought police The present-day science community operates a lot like a cartel, like some sort of thought police, censoring beliefs and touting their way as the only way to the portals of science. Censoring any discussion of an intelligent design in nature , modern-day scientists seem to be following some ideological cult. The Creator is pushed out of the discussion. Science has become strictly material, and it's bought and sold and followed blindly, like some sort of arrogant idolatry of self. Here's the piece that angered the scientific community: 'the biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture... is the proper design by the Creator to perform a multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way.' Even though the sentence described the researcher's deeper observations and conclusions, it was forcibly removed as the entire study on the inner workings of the human hand was retracted. Speaking in the journal Nature , one of the Chinese authors of the study was baffled. '[W]e are not native speakers of English, and entirely lost the connotations of some words such as 'Creator,'' he said. 'I am sorry for that.' This didn't matter to PLOS ONE . Any mention of the word Creator , in whatever context, is forbidden. PLOS ONE follows along in cult-like fashion, obeying the egotistical science community Science editor of PLOS ONE Danilo Russo had strong feelings about the study, saying, 'I feel outraged by the publication of a [manuscript] making explicit reference to creationism. This is an extremely serious issue for which the academic editor who handled the paper as well as the journal, besides the authors themselves, should be blamed.' He continues, 'I feel my scientific reputation to be put at risk by this incredible mistake, so should this paper not be retracted as soon as possible I will be compelled to resign from my position of PLoS ONE academic editor. Moreover, I am determined to avoid taking on any further assignment until this issue is fully solved.' His response is indicative of the obedient, cult-like behavior of today's egotistical, censorship brand of science . Melanie Phillips of The Times of London explains the debacle very well. 'Underlying much of this disarray,' she wrote, 'is surely the pressure to conform to an idea, whether political, commercial or ideological.' 'Scientists [today] pose as secular priests,' wrote Phillips. 'They alone, they claim, hold the keys to the universe.... The resulting absence of openness and transparency is proving the scientists' undoing.' Science and spirituality don't have to be contrasts; they help explain one another Intellectual intolerance is plaguing the present-day scientific community, censoring out any discussion about a grander, intelligent design occurring within, throughout and above nature. In their arrogance, many scientists create a divide between what they call science and what they see as a fictitious Creator. Science does not have to be at war with the idea of a Creator. The intricate beauty, vastness, natural relationships and interconnectedness of our world and universe show that man will never be able to understand it all, that there are powers, intelligence and a design greater than us. The bloated ego of our current cult science must be deflated and replaced with a greater tolerance for the ideas that bridge our understanding of science and our spirituality. The gatekeepers of 'science' do not hold all the answers, and maybe that's what scares the present-day science community the most. Maybe they object to the idea of a grand Designer because then they would have to humble themselves and let go their ego. Sources include: CNSNews.com Journals.PLOS.org Science.selfnews.com "
0," The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) today launched 'Operation False Cures,' a coordinated scheme to censor natural cancer remedies and financially destroy companies offering them for sale. In doing so, the FTC joins the criminals at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who currently operate an extortion racket that works by threatening health supplement companies with legal action unless they settle with the FDA by paying them million of dollars. Both the FTC and FDA work to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical companies by discrediting or outlawing competing natural cures that work better, more safely and more affordably than FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. In order to understand what's really going on with the FTC, the key question to ask yourself is simply this: Are there such things as anti-cancer nutrients? In other words, do anti-cancer nutrients actually exist in the real world? Of course they do. Broccoli is loaded with them. So is green tea. Zinc is anti-cancer, selenium is anti-cancer, and rainforest herbs are absolutely loaded with anti-cancer nutrients. Vitamin D is such a strong anti-cancer nutrient that, all by itself, it prevents an astonishing 77% of all cancer, and this is all published in peer-reviewed science journals. Turmeric is anti-cancer, especially when combined with black pepper. So is resveratrol, seaweed, spirulina, chlorella, brown seaweed extract, raw foods, sprouted foods, cabbage, onions, garlic and a thousand other foods. Now get this: The FTC doesn't believe anti-cancer nutrients exist! That's where this whole story enters bizarro land. The FTC, you see, doesn't believe anybody should be able to state on any website that there is such a thing as an anti-cancer nutrient. Period! According to the FTC , anyone even mentioning a 'cure for cancer' is automatically a quack, regardless of the science backing their position. Why won't the FTC question the fraud of Big Pharma? That's because the real intent of the FTC is, of course, to shut down the health supplements industry , thereby protecting its corporate buddies in Big Pharma. Notice how the FTC never goes after the fraudulent advertising and outrageously false health claims of drug companies? I mean, if you're going to protect consumers from dangerous substances being sold, then there's no better place to start than with Big Pharma. Its drugs kill 100,000 Americans a year . What does the FTC have to say about that? Nothing. How about the fraudulent science, the censored negative studies, the criminal price fixing practices and the monopoly racket run by Big Pharma and the FDA... does the FTC spend any effort looking into that? Of course not. What about the fact that FDA and Big Pharma are running a monopolistic price fixing scheme that allows some drugs to be sold at more than 500,000% markups over their manufacturing prices? Americans pay the highest prices in the world -- by far -- for their prescription drugs, and the drug control authorities trap Americans into monopoly pricing by banning imports from Canada and other countries. It's blatant monopolistic pricing, and if it were happening to T-shirts, cars or software, the FTC would leap right in and start suing the companies involved. But when it concerns pharmaceuticals, the FTC remains silent, covering its eyes to the interstate commerce crimes being committed right now by the pharmaceutical industry. Why the FTC is a threat to America The FTC isn't looking out for you folks, it's just part of the criminal gang that's taking away your Free Speech, suppressing your access to truthful information about natural cancer cures , and harming tens of millions of Americans in the process. It's just another corrupt, government-run group of con artists who delude themselves into thinking they're protecting people by suppressing information about cancer cures. You see, the official position of the U.S. government, the drug industry and the entire medical system is that cancer cures don't exist! That's astonishing, given that I've personally spoken to hundreds (maybe thousands) of people who CURED cancer using raw foods, nutritional supplements, anti-cancer herbs and alternative therapies. I've personally spoken with people who have cured pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, skin cancer, bone cancer, throat cancer, thyroid cancer and all sorts of other cancers. I suppose, according to the FTC, I must have been imagining all these conversations. Maybe I'm hallucinating from eating too much vitamin C, and now I'm dreaming up imaginary conversations with people who claim to have cured cancer. That's apparently what the FTC believes. You see, the FTC has fallen in line with all the other health system criminals operating in the United States today by declaring there is no cure for cancer. It's like claiming 'The Earth is flat!' It's such outmoded, ignorant thinking that I can only laugh in total disgust at the so-called 'intelligent' people making that argument. Of course, it's in the interests of the cancer industry to keep everybody completely misinformed about cancer cures. They can't afford to let you learn the truth about how easy it is to cure cancer . Cancer cures are so commonplace now that you'd have to actually make a conscious effort not to see them. You can cure cancer with infrared sauna therapies (detox through sweat) combined with the Max Gerson diet ( www.Gerson.org ), a raw foods diet, superfood supplements, and even things like insulin potentiation therapy, ultraviolet irradiation of your blood, oxygen therapy, Chinese medicine herbs and a whole host of other natural therapies that really work. You can't find most of these therapies offered in the United States because all the natural cancer doctors have either been arrested or fled the country due to the outright oppression of any medical technology outside the toxic chemotherapy and radiation protocols. Curing cancer, as one Chinese medicine doctor once told me, is easier than curing the common cold. But you'll probably have to leave the USA to actually participate in a cure, since curing or treating the cause of cancer (or just about any disease) has been outlawed in the U.S. Eliminating cancer tumors and boosting natural immune function is so incredibly easy that it takes the cancer industry billions of dollars a year in propaganda just to try to hide the truth from people. The FTC and FDA, for their part, use taxpayer money to continue the charade, so they essentially have unlimited funds to pursue their cancer propaganda and disinformation campaigns. Only the internet allows people to learn the truth about cancer, and of course they're trying to shut that down, too. Only a few organizations like selfnews -- which sells no supplements whatsoever -- remains insulated from the orchestrated attacks on free speech now being waged by the FTC and FDA. Together, these two government monstrosities have become a force of death and destruction, laying waste to the health education of the American People, enforcing ignorance and health illiteracy that keeps the People enslaved in a fraudulent cancer racket offering nothing but bankruptcy and death. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Operation False Information If anything, the FTC's announcement today should be called Operation False Information , because that's what it's all about: Spreading lies and disinformation about cancer cures, hoping to dissuade people from learning the truth about the very real cancer cures that exist right now. In taking this position, the FTC has joined the ranks of the criminally-operated FDA, EPA, DEA and USDA, all of which now operate as taxpayer-funded branches of Big Pharma that seek to destroy anything that competes with drug profits and the 'culture of death' permeating American society. From a Biblical perspective, these organizations would be considered satanic, as if they were possessed by the devil himself. If this were Lord of the Rings, they would be like the Dark Lord Sauron, raising armies of orcs to spread darkness and death across the land in the quest for power and control. Make no mistake: The FTC is waging war against the People, much like the FDA, and it will stop at nothing to discredit, destroy and bankrupt the natural products industry in its desperate, evil-minded efforts to enslave Americans in the Big Pharma system of medical control. Because, let's face it: Any organization that claims there is no cure for cancer is delusional. They also claim there's no cure for diabetes, or heart disease, or osteoporosis. In fact, these delusional government people believe there is no cure for ANY disease! That's right: They don't believe there is any such thing as a cure for anything. That's a serious sign of complete detachment from reality. These people are more delusional than a bunch of DEA agents smoking up the crack they confiscated from the local crack house. They are high on their power and steeped in ignorance. They know nothing of the real world and operate from a fictional set of delusions they're now trying to imprint upon the American people. To say there's no such thing as a natural cure for cancer is to instantly label yourself a moron. There are hundreds of natural cures for cancer, and people are curing themselves every day, using no pharmaceuticals, no chemotherapy, no irradiation and no doctors. And it's that reality that scares the bejeezus out of the cancer industry. No doctors? Well how on earth are they supposed to make their money if people can cure cancer themselves? That's the whole point, actually: While I want to set you free with the knowledge and power to heal yourself (and I have nothing to gain from you curing cancer, by the way), the cancer industry has everything to lose if you are empowered with knowledge and informed about natural cancer cures that really work. If you're cancer free, they'll lose your business, and the cancer industry is far more concerned about its own revenues than your health, believe me. Is there such a thing as false advertising of natural cures? Of course there is. Not all cancer cures on the internet are honest. But the FTC doesn't limit its targeted to just false promises. The FTC, by its own admission, believes that ANY mention of a cancer 'cure' is, by itself, fraudulent. Thus, it throws the baby out with the bathwater by targeting all products that claim to cure cancer. Now, if you want to talk about false cures, let's talk about the chemotherapy industry, and the mammography industry, and the whole fraudulent system of oncology. A rigorous review of the scientific literature on chemotherapy reveals that chemotherapy simply doesn't work on 98% of people. It's a fraud all by itself. And even when it 'works' to shrink tumors, it doesn't give people quality of life or restored health. It doesn't cure cancer, in other words. It merely poisons the patient. Mammography is also a fraud. Rigorous scientific studies reveal that mammography harms ten women for every one woman it helps . The devices actually cause cancer by irradiating the breasts! (See http://www.selfnews.com/020829.html ) Modern oncology is a fraud. It's marketed through a system of controlled, fabricated fear. An oncologist makes a false diagnosis, then scares the patient into agreeing to high-profit treatments by telling them, 'You only have six months to live.' This is not merely unethical, it's a criminal deception that's used every day in America to sign up consumers for conventional cancer treatments that will only harm them. So where is the FTC on investigating the chemotherapy fraud? The mammography fraud? The fear marketing tactics of modern oncology? The FTC, as you well know, is a no-show on these issues. Apparently, poisons that kill people, and procedures that maim women are perfectly fine with the FTC, even when they are promoted using deceptive marketing tactics! The FTC, you see, thinks nothing of women being disfigured and having their breasts sliced off by cancer surgeons, even when they don't yet have breast cancer! That's perfectly fine with the FTC. But if you approach that same woman and offer to sell her some broccoli sprouts that can help reverse breast cancer, then suddenly you're the criminal! So the insane doctors wielding scalpels, poisons and lies are fully protected by the FTC, while the naturopaths selling healing nutrients and safe, effective cancer therapies are considered criminals. Welcome to the USA, friends... the land of medical insanity and government-enforced oppression of natural cures. The People's Protection Agency I think we need a new agency called the People's Protection Agency (PPA). The PPA is tasked with making arrests of the top criminals at the FTC, FDA, DEA, USDA and other government racket groups that threaten the health and safety of the American People. The PPA would have a list of certain people to arrest and prosecute for their crimes against humanity. It should be a completely non-violent organization, of course, but it should bring these unindicted criminals to justice and let all the evidence come out in a public forum where the truth is a matter of public record. This list should include the top criminals at the FTC and FDA who are orchestrating these campaigns of health destruction and enforced ignorance against the American people. I would hope that these criminals be brought to justice through proper arrest and prosecution, and I might even recommend that we grant them immunity in exchange for their full accounts of what happened (like many Nazi war criminals, or even the Apartheid criminals in South Africa) so that future generations can learn from the mistakes of our own. It's time to end government-sponsored medical tyranny We are past the time of tolerating the ongoing medical abuse of our families and our children. It is time for the American People to stand up against tyranny, ignorance and oppression. It's time to take back our rights to openly and honestly describe the anti-cancer properties of plants, nutrients and therapies. And it's time that we recognized any person, institution or government that interferes with those God-given rights is itself an enemy of the People, and a disservice to all of humanity. Stay subscribed to selfnews to join the (peaceful) revolution that's coming. Together, we can help transform this world from a place of death, destruction and ignorance to one of life, abundance and free knowledge. There are institutions that wish to prevent us from setting our fellow human beings free, but those institutions are already beginning to crumble, and soon, the opportunity will be right to step forward and be part of the creation of The Next Society, where knowledge reigns over ignorance, peace triumphs over war, and the People are set free from the mental prisons in which they've been trapped for generations. Today's actions by the FTC are the last, desperate attempts to hold together the fragile bars of those prisons and prevent the human race from being set free by the truth about healing cancer. We can live in a world without cancer. The technology exists right now. It's probably growing in your back yard. And yet the cancer industry is doing everything in its power to isolate people from the truth and prevent cancer cures from becoming so widely known that the entire cancer industry implodes like Bear Stearns Co. Be part of the revolution. Forward this article to everyone you know. Post it everywhere. Spread the truth, free the People, and stand up against the ignorance, tyranny and oppression of the cancer industry and its police state enforcers: The FTC and FDA. "

Whether it's a majestic song or a pleasant voice, the sounds of nature or a child's laughter, sounds can have a very positive or negative effect not only on our moods, but even on our body's right down to the atomic level. This is because all matter vibrates at various and specific frequencies. These frequencies can be used for either positive or negative effects. Scientist's have used these laws of physics to create various weapons, medicine uses sound to view inside the body or dissolve stones or tumors and the Chinese have been using sounds to heal and cure for millennia. In the advanced spiritual practices, various chanting methods are used to generate a more peaceful state of mind, boost the energy in various organ systems and increase immunity throughout the entire body. These methods can be used for religious or purely health related purposes. It all depends upon the desire and goals of the practitioner. These methods are based on pure science and the physics of vibrations, something that the Chinese have been aware of for millennia. In the first two articles in this series it was mentioned that the Chinese discovered through observation and analysis of patients that when a person had an illness whose origin was traced to a particular organ, that person always made the same sounds of distress (moaning, whining, and whimpering) regardless of the language that the person spoke. This is equivalent to how people all over the world make the same ha ha sound when they laugh, regardless of their spoken language, the sound is always made when laughing. A person laughs because the body is purging itself of excess fire energy built up in the heart channels when you experience something funny. Martial artists are familiar with the making of various sounds when throwing punches or performing other techniques. Karate practitioners often use the 'Keeah' sound to help increase striking power. Chinese martial artists use other sounds that are even more effective which are based on the same principles as the six healing sounds. When making these sounds during a particular technique, it is known to cause an increase in power, strength and energy. Similar to these sounds that martial artists use to increase power are sounds that can be used to cool, calm and heal various organs of the body. When these sounds are performed in a gentler manner, they can greatly aid in the elimination of excess fire energies from those organs. In Chinese medicine it is often these excess fire energies that are responsible for many diseases and conditions that are so prevalent in today's society. By purging these energies from the body we can greatly boost the health of the organ and heal any diseases the excess and stagnant fire chi may be causing. In the first two articles in this series we covered the sounds for the Lungs and Kidneys. "

Drinking between 5 and 8 cups of green tea each day was shown to lower body weight by 5.6% and to decrease abdominal fat stores by 17.8% over a period of 8 weeks. Green tea consumption has long been associated with lowered risk of cancer, metabolic syndrome and heart disease. This research provides compelling evidence that green tea boosts metabolism to target fat stores and assists weight loss efforts. Green tea extracts have been researched extensively over the past decade and are shown to dramatically lower the risk of Alzheimer`s disease and dementia, cardiovascular disease and many forms of cancer. Additional studies have shown that the polyphenols in green tea are a significant factor in improved oral health and can provide necessary support for weight management and control. Green tea is composed of four primary polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epicatechin) that are shown to influence genetic signaling and metabolic rate. The study was conducted by Polish researchers and used an animal model to determine weight loss and fat accumulation characteristics. The researchers also analyzed cardiovascular risk factors and atherogenesis over an 8 week period. The animals were fed a high fat diet and drank green tea made from either a 1.1% or 2% extract of the active phenolic compound. The results indicate that body weight and fat reduction are dose dependent with maximum results (5.6% lower body weight, 17.8% fat reduction) achieved with the 2% extract. Researchers also found that both concentrations of green tea extract reduced atherogenesis (initial loss of coronary artery elasticity leading to artery hardening and future heart disease) by 14.3% compared to non-supplemented subjects. The study authors did not determine the mechanism for cardiovascular risk reduction. Prior research has shown that the potent antioxidant content of green tea is responsible for significantly lowered levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol and increased particle size that are consistent with reduced heart disease risk. This study used the equivalent of 5 to 8 cups of green tea consumed each day to achieve optimal weight management, fat reduction and cardiovascular risk reversal. Researchers found that the green tea concentration is important to achieve optimal weight lowering results. Drink 6 cups of fresh brewed, non-fluoridated green tea daily (or take a standardized green tea extract supplement) to help prevent coronary artery disease, assist weight loss and boost fat reduction efforts.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) As explained by Ronda Bresnick Hauss in a recent article in the Hill Rag, advanced technology such as PET scans and MRIs allow researchers to examine the brain. While using the mind to heal the body was often discredited or disregarded in the past, these new approaches indicate that the placebo effect does cause actual changes in brain chemistry which in turn leads to changes in the body. Using a placebo means deliberately using a `medicine` that contains no active ingredients. A patient who manifests improvement after taking a placebo obviously becomes better through his or her faith or belief in the process rather than due to any benefit derived from the medicine. Hauss explains how thoughts or beliefs influence the body. When someone is home alone at night and hears a noise, s/he may think someone is breaking in. Breathing speeds up and heart rate increases in response to this threat. Then, with the discovery that a spouse has come home, breathing and heart rate normalize. Hauss reports on a recent clinical study conducted by Benson Friedman at the Mind/Body Medical Institute of the Harvard Medical School. In this study, 60 to 90 percent of diseases such as angina pectoris, bronchial asthma, herpes simplex and duodenal ulcer when treated with placebos showed beneficial results. Other conditions in which placebos have been effective are anxiety, stress, warts and ulcers. Placebos have been found to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and to improve reaction times, pulse rates and immune system activity. In a study of depression, Thomas Walsh, a psychiatrist at Columbia University, found that 30 percent of patients taking placebos experienced improvement. Trials with young people using placebos and the drug Zoloft show even greater results. While 69 percent improved with the drug, 59 percent improved with a placebo. Friedman noted that, for the placebo effect , it was important to have positive beliefs and expectations on the part of both the patient and the health care professional, and a good relationship between both parties. Friedman urged that the term ``placebo effect`` should be dropped in favor of ``remembered wellness``. Remembered wellness , also referred to as the relaxation response, as explained by Julie Milne, is the process of invoking good feelings, of feelings of well-being, to reduce stress, anxiety or pain. Reasons offered for the success of placebos were that patients get more attention from alternative practitioners. Alternative practitioners are good listeners and build trust. One doctor noted that the extra attention and rapport resulted in biological improvement. Currently, 50 percent of German doctors use placebos. One in five physicians and psychiatrists in Canada have used placebos. According to Dr. Charles Raison, in a new approach to testing the efficacy of placebos at Harvard, patients with irritable bowel syndrome were openly informed that they were being given a `sugar pill.` Remarkably, Raison writes, the patients improved `significantly` over those who`d taken nothing. A placebo , Raison notes, adapts itself to whatever condition a patient has. Given for depression, it causes brain changes. Given for backache, it can mimic the effects of opioid analgesics. In cases of Parkinson`s it induces the body to produce more dopamine. Hauss, R. B. (2011). The placebo effect: The amazing power of the mind to heal the body.

0," I'm a Navy veteran who served a four year enlistment from 1979-1983. I was 17 when I signed up and turned 18 the day I completed boot-camp. I was trained as an Aviation Electrician. After all my schooling was completed I was assigned to helicopter squadron HSL-33. It was a unique squadron because the helicopters were not used on aircraft carriers or other aircraft oriented ships but rather a relatively small ship called a'Fast Frigate'. They named this type of detachment 'LAMPS' The ships were modified to accommodate a single helicopter. In 1982 I was part of the aviation detachment to the USS Lockwood. The ship was froward deployed which meant it's home-port was outside the United States. The USS Lockwood's home-port was Japan. It was a very memorable experience. I visited fascinating Oriental countries and gained a valuable insight into how different the rest of the world is from America. There was one day that will always remain the most memorable of all. The USS Lockwood was about 100 miles off the coast of Thailand. We encountered an incredible sight. A small boat crammed with people. It was a mix of men,women and children. The boat was in bad shape and it was loaded beyond the weight limits intend for it and barely able to keep from taking on water. Our ship stopped and pulled along side. I was on topside and witnessed the whole event. As the small craft drifted closer to the ship you could see the desperation in their faces. Soon we were informed that these people were refugees making a very dangerous attempt to flee Vietnam and make it to Thailand . Even as late as 1982 the aftermath of the Vietnam War was still destroying the lives of the people of Vietnam. Another announcement came stating that the refugees were out of water, food, and fuel. They would of never made it to Thailand still about 100 hundred miles away. The announcement was made by the Executive Officer. He continued, 'we will give them the supplies they need and send them on their way.' The reaction was immediate among the crew, we were stunned. Even with supplies and fuel the odds were against them ever making it to Thailand . Then something unexpected happened. A few minutes after that announcement the Captain of the USS Lockwood made this announcement, 'in order to avoid a mutiny we are going to give these refugees a ride to Thailand.' High fives and smiles were to be seen everywhere I looked. We took them aboard and the crew used the ship's only gun near the bow to sink the abandoned boat. That's done to prevent it from being a possible danger to other ships passing through the area. A few hours later we came across another boat of Vietnamese refugees. There were no more announcements the ship picked up those desperate people too. When I think back on that day a number of thoughts come to mind. How many of those small boats with desperate refugees didn't make it to Thailand? I wonder what happened to the refugees we saved? The USS Lockwood was given a Humanitarian Award. We wore a ribbon on our uniforms for the actions taken that day. I'm proud of the attitude of my fellow shipmates they instinctively wanted to help those people. I'm proud I served on a ship with a compassionate Captain that overruled his Executive Officer. His remarks about a mutiny were tongue-in-cheek, there was no danger of that happening. He knew however, it would damage ship morale. I'm grateful the Captain allowed his crew to be the good Americans that day.

0," So you may not know that almost all of the vitamin C supplement manufacturers are making their vitamin C from genetically engineered corn. What! You exclaim. How am I supposed to get enough vitamin C into my family if I don't buy store bought supplements? Answer: You make your own! What you are about to read is something that the giant pharmaceutical companies don't want you to see. Even the health food stores don't want you to know about this secret. You can make your very own vitamin C supplement that is ten times better than anything you could buy in a store at NO EXTRA COST TO YOU! Does it have a 1,000 mg of vitamin C per dosage? Nope. Does it have the USRDA amount per dosage? Not at all. Has it been approved by the FDA? Absolutely not! What homemade vitamin C does have is live enzymes that allow the vitamin C to be 100% assimilated into your body. It has its own natural source of rutin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids. It's easily acquired, easy to make, and even tastes good, too. It's just orange & lemon peels. It's that easy. Any organic orange or lemon peels left over from the fruit you buy will do the trick. Save all of your peels after you eat the inside of the fruit and cut them into thin strips. Place them on a plate on your dining room table and let them dry at room temperature for a couple of days until dry and crisp. You can also dehydrate the peels with a food dehydrator and then store them for about a year in a dry container. For consumption, one idea is to break up peels into smaller pieces and mix them with your favorite tea. This makes the tea taste great, but the downside to this approach is that heat destroys the enzymes . A better option is to place the peel strips into your coffee grinder and grind them into a powder (which won't hurt the enzymes) and use to mix with your early morning smoothie. One rounded teaspoon will supply you with more organic vitamin C complex, rutin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids than your body needs for the day, regardless of your size. And this homemade citrus peel powder mixed in your blender with some fresh organic apple juice tastes good, too.

0," Tweet As the song says, 'You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone' -- and motor skills are no exception. Despite the ranking of the opposable thumb as one of the single most important evolutionary advantages of the human race, many people take the use of their hands for granted until something draws their attention to it, such as arthritis. Joseph B. Marion, author of 'The Anti-Aging Manual', says that an estimated 41 million Americans suffer from arthritis. Arthritis is actually a term covering over 100 rheumatic diseases; but basically, the affliction can be defined as an inflammation of the joints. According to http://www.rlrouse.com, the two most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis, which generally is caused by every day wear and tear on the foot or poor choices of shoe design, and rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the body's autoimmune system begins attacking its own cells, causing joint deterioration and deformation. Some researchers believe a bacterium or virus causes this body malfunction, and others believe that certain people are more genetically susceptible to the condition. This is not to say that some people are genetically predestined to get arthritis, only that some genetic traits put them at more risk. Although the exact catalyst that causes the body's immune system to attack its own synovium is unknown, the website, http://solvearthritisnow.com, lists some of the common things that can worsen the symptoms. These include lectins, such as those found in lima beans, lentils, and nightshade vegetables, food allergies, especially sensitivity to wheat and dairy products, and chemical sensitivities, particularly smoking or second-hand smoke. Arthritis is different from most afflictions in that it isn't always a chronic condition. In a few cases, arthritis will only cause noticeable discomfort during 'flare-ups' which are often caused by changes in barometric pressure and cold weather. Rheumatoid arthritis usually attacks the joints of individuals between 20 and 60, but it has been known to plague some younger joints as well in a condition known as juvenile arthritis. After age 70, new instances of the disease seem to decline. According to http://www.neckreference.com, the condition affects women three times more than men. Foods to avoid for arthritis sufferers According to Phyllis A. Balch, author of 'Prescription for Dietary Wellness,' some arthritis sufferers should avoid nightshade vegetables, so named because they grow in the shade of night rather than during the day. Vegetables in this group include potatoes, eggplant, peppers (although direct application of peppers on joints can be helpful), and tomatoes. Nightshades contain an alkaloid called solanine, which seems to have a negative effect on calcium balance, and can even cause headaches. Balch cites Norman F. Childers, a former professor of horticulture at Rutgers University in New Jersey and author of 'The Nightshades and Health.' Childers was an arthritis sufferer who noticed increased joint pain and stiffness after consuming any type of tomatoes. Childers experimented with his consumption of nightshades. After he had eliminated all nightshade vegetables from his diet, Childers found his arthritis pain to have subsided. Childers concluded, 'Regular consumption of tomatoes, potatoes and eggplants is a primary cause of arthritis.' Childers suggests avoiding nightshade vegetables for a month and observing whether symptoms subside or are alleviated. Other substances to avoid include tobacco, coffee, caffeinated tea, salt, artificial colors, and preservatives. Meat is also said to aggravate arthritis, as it is high in uric acid, a primary factor in the aggravation of symptoms. The effects of uric acid can be mitigated by not consuming meat, while consuming dandelion greens, parsley, alfalfa, and the herb devil's claw. Treating arthritis naturally The conventional medical theory is that there is no cure for arthritis, only treatments for joint pain and inflammation, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and the nutritional supplement glucosamine. But anti-inflammatory medicines, while beneficial in the short-term, can begin to make the problem worse, as well as deteriorate the stomach and liver. There are surgical procedures to help with arthritis involving the draining of certain antibodies. Actual joint replacement is another procedure. But these seem rather barbaric. In the past, medical practitioners had even recommended the removal of teeth as a treatment for arthritis. Another dramatic and unorthodox treatment is a practice known as urtication, which involves using a gloved hand to 'sting' the afflicted joints with a herb known as 'stinging nettle,' or urtica dioica. Although slightly painful, James A. Duke talks of his success with stinging painful joints in 'The Green Pharmacy.' Some homeopathic practitioners have discovered a less dramatic approach, finding success in relieving arthritis pain with more natural treatments, such as the consumption of certain fruits and vegetable juices. Mark Stengler, author of 'Natural Physicians Healing Therapies,' says that vegetables and their juices contain phytonutrients which can be instrumental in aiding the body in regenerating cells a vital part of treating arthritis. Even orange juice can help since it contains vitamin C, an antioxidant. Antioxidants assist the body in the reduction of swelling and inflammation of the joints. Cherry juice for arthritis pain According to an interview with Eve Campanelli, PhD in Prevention magazine, 85 percent of Campanelli's patients had experienced at least partial relief of pain symptoms by drinking two glasses of black cherry juice (four ounces of juice diluted with four ounces of water) twice a day. In addition, Campanelli states that patients can discontinue consumption of the juice once their pain subsides. Campanelli recommends using cherries which have been kept cool and moist, and which have a deep maroon, mahogany, red, or black color. She suggests avoiding fruit of the following kind: those that are shriveled, with dried stems, soft flesh, brown discolorations, or a dull appearance. 'People with rheumatoid arthritis should include in their daily diets juices high in the anti-inflammatory nutrients,' said Cherie Calbom, M.S. Calbom is a certified nutritionist in Kirkland, Washington, and co-author of 'Juicing for Life.' Calbom adds that parsley, broccoli, and spinach can assist in the treatment of arthritis, since these contain beta-carotene, along with carrots, apples, and ginger, all of which contain copper. She also promotes the drinking of pineapple juice, since it is the only source of the strong anti-inflammatory enzyme bromelain. Bromelain helps the body breakdown protein. Incomplete protein break down (i.e. poor digestion) is a condition implicated in arthritis. Bromelain also helps break down plaque and fatty tissue deposits that can clog arteries. It also assists in the natural healing of bruises and minor abrasions. Other juices said to help include bilberry, celery juice, green barley juice, aloe vera juice, and boswellia extract. Birch cortisone can also help reduce inflammation of joints; however, cortisones can interfere with calcium absorption and should be used sparingly. Not all juices have a positive effect on arthritis symptoms. In 'The New Age Herbalist,' Richard Mabey states that spinach juice and spinach itself is bad for arthritis because it contains oxalic acid which can interfere with calcium absorption and exacerbate arthritic symptoms. Stengler says fish oil has been known to have a positive effect on arthritis symptoms. In one experiment, patients who completely supplemented their arthritis treatments and medications with fish oil while giving up their chemical treatments experienced no relapse in their arthritis symptoms. Stengler suggests using at least 3,000 milligrams daily, but added that some patients didn't require such a high dosage. 'Once you start taking fish oil, you can expect to stay on it for at least 12 weeks before it begins to yield benefits,' said Stengler, 'but after that, you can stay on it indefinitely.' However, Stengler suggests that fish oil be used only as one component of a complete arthritis treatment. Some schools of thought rely on acupuncture to assist in dealing with arthritis pain. Acupuncture is based on an ancient Chinese philosophy that the body has an energy called qi, pronounced 'chee.' Application of needles to certain points can restore the flow of qi along invisible channels called meridians. Theoretically, when meridians are disrupted, the body becomes ill in response, such as displaying symptoms of arthritis. Proponents of the practice explain it goes beyond temporary relief and actually re-patterns the body. With some of these lesser known treatment options, arthritis sufferers may no longer have to gravitate toward dry climates to find relief from their pain. Juices and diet changes may provide an equitable solution to the pain caused by arthritis. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Starbucks Coffee -- the world's largest retailer of specialty coffee -- announced last week that it was switching many of its stores in western states and New England to milk free of the controversial artificial hormone rBGH, a move experts say will further harm Monsanto's declining sales of the hormone. The coffee giant announced on Jan. 17 that it had decided to make 37 percent of its dairy products rBGH-free in a number of its stores in Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Montana, New Mexico, Northern California and New England. The artificial hormone -- created by Monsanto and sold as Posilac -- is given to roughly one-third of America's 9 million dairy cows to increase milk production and boost farmers' per-cow revenues. However, consumer advocacy groups have opposed rBGH since the FDA approved it in 1993, claiming its full effects on humans are unknown, and it can boost the risk of developing cancer. Monsanto was aware in late 2006 that increasing consumer demand for hormone-free milk could lead to lower profits. In November, the company issued a warning to investors: 'We believe some processor requests for 'r-BST-free' milk, coupled with rising feed costs, could limit our future sales.' However, higher demand for dairy products free of rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) could mean higher profits for companies that produce organic dairy products, such as Dean Foods' 'Horizon' brand organic milk. According to Dean Foods spokesperson Marguerite Copel, Starbucks' switch to hormone-free milk in many locations could mean booming business. 'We see it as an opportunity -- we don't see it as a negative -- to provide more choices to consumers,' Copel said. According to consumer health advocate Mike Adams, author of 'Grocery Warning,' grassroots journalism and internet activism helped bring about Starbucks' change. 'This decision shows the reach of the internet in educating consumers about the dangers of food additives and factory farming practices that powerful corporations would rather keep silent,' Adams said. 'Corporations may continue to try to shove frankenfoods down the throats of American consumers, but their efforts to hoodwink consumers and bribe government regulators are being exposed by grassroots journalism and passionate reporting from honest consumer groups.' While smaller coffee chains have been in contact with Starbucks to determine where they can purchase rBST-free dairy products for their consumers, larger retailers have also jumped on the hormone-free milk bandwagon. Earlier this week, Safeway announced that its milk suppliers in Washington and Oregon would no longer be using rBGH to increase milk production. ### "
0," Tweet There is a reality about weight loss that people need to be aware of. Losing weight requires you to feel hungry from time to time. There is no way to lose weight without feeling some degree of hunger. Believe me, I have exhaustively explored this issue. I have tried appetite suppressants. I have tried food combinations. I have tried meal-timing strategies. I have tried just about everything natural under the sun to eliminate those hunger pangs and food cravings that you get when you are attempting to lose weight and there is nothing that completely eliminates those cravings. Hoodia gordonii helps, as I've stated in previous articles, but it by no means turns off your hunger like a light switch. There are many strategies that help reduce hunger: avoiding refined carbohydrates, getting plenty of natural sunlight on your skin, drinking large amounts of water on a regular basis, and getting plenty of fiber in your diet. But there is nothing that absolutely eliminates hunger. The bottom line is that if you are going to lose weight, you are going to experience hunger at one time or another. This is especially true if you, like me, engage in strength training. Nothing gets your appetite whipped into a fury like the leg press. The key in all this is realizing there's nothing wrong with experiencing hunger from time to time. It's a normal human response to a decrease in your consumption of calories. The problem that most people encounter when they feel hungry is they feel it's some sort of emergency. It feels like they are dying or wasting away when, in fact, the body is just signaling that it doesn't have enough calories to add new fat to the fat stores it's already carrying around. The first feelings of hunger are really more of a false alarm than anything to be concerned about. At least from a logical point of view. (But when you feel like you're starving, logic goes out the window, right?) A person who is aiming for a low percentage of body fat learns to manage their hunger so that it becomes something they can live with. In my own experience with losing weight -- and remember, I dropped 50 pounds of body fat using absolutely no drugs or pharmaceuticals of any kind -- I found that there are several 'lifesaving' foods and beverages you can turn to when you are feeling intense hunger pains but you don't want to consume foods that add significant calories to your daily intake. These foods and drinks are what I call emergency appetite control foods. What these foods and beverages have in common is that they make your stomach feel like it's full of calorie-rich foods. But in reality, you are filling your stomach with foods that contain almost no calories or carbohydrates. This way, even though your stomach is full, you are not adding calories to your intake. But your body is temporarily fooled into thinking you've just woofed down a triple-plate buffet. In other words, if you eat two cups of cashews versus two cups of cabbage, your body can't really tell the difference for the first few minutes. Your stomach will turn off the hunger signals thinking you have eaten a large quantity of food regardless of whether you are eating cabbage or cashews, but in fact the cabbage may only contain 20 calories while the cashews contain as much as 900 or even 1000 calories. Two cups of cashews provides probably half the calories you need for the entire day, whereas two cups of cabbage provides virtually no calories whatsoever. You burn off the cabbage just digesting it. (Raw cabbage is, in fact, an outright cure for ulcers. But that's another article...) Emergency appetite control food #1 Fresh drinking water. That's right: water is a powerful appetite suppressant and if you drink an 8-ounce glass of water when you first start feeling hungry, you will find that it suppresses your appetite in nearly every case. If you just drink a full glass of water and have the discipline to wait 10 minutes, you will find that your appetite is either completely gone or dramatically reduced. Your next choice, if water does not do the trick for you, is to purchase a 32-ounce quart of natural, organic vegetable broth. You can get organic vegetable broth from Trader Joe's, health food stores, or even many of the finer grocery stores that have a natural health section. The key is to get organic vegetable broth that does not contain excitotoxins. These are ingredients that cause neurological disorders because they overexcite and harm nerve cells. Those ingredients are MSG, yeast extract, autolyzed yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable proteins, and other similar ingredients. Warning: watch out for broth products made by Kitchen Basics. They claim their products don't contain MSG or yeast extract, but when I tried their product, I experienced a massive 'MSG headache' that tells me it contains free glutamic acid that isn't listed on the label. (I'm very sensitive to MSG.) The brand of broth I buy is Trade Joe's house brand, which does not contain free glutamic acid. You can also choose organic chicken broth if you prefer the flavor of chicken. Once you have that, simply empty the entire quart into a very large bowl, heat it up and eat it like soup. You will probably be unable to get through the entire bowl without feeling full. And how many calories have you consumed? Not 900 like you get in two cups of cashews or 1200 like in a big Mac, not even 300 calories like you get from a typical protein bar, instead you get 20 calories only. That's right: you can feel full on 20 calories by drinking an entire quart of organic vegetable broth. Emergency appetite control food #2 The next best strategy is to turn to green vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, bokchoy, and other leafy vegetables. They have so few calories that in my own diet, I don't even count them. That's right: I allow myself to eat an unlimited quantity of any green leafy vegetables without even recording the number of calories I have consumed. In my book, they are 'free' foods. It takes just as many calories for your body to digest them as you get out of the foods themselves. And yet at the same time, they fill your stomach and make you feel full, turning off the hunger signals in your brain. You may have also heard these called 'negative calorie foods.' You can consume these green leafy vegetables in a couple of ways. Most people don't like to eat them plain. Instead, you can fill up a very large bowl (I am talking about something the size of a family dinner salad bowl) with lettuce and salad greens, then add only 100 calories worth of salad dressing. You will want to find some of the lower calorie salad dressings out there, and of course you want to avoid MSG, high-fructose corn syrup, and other ingredients in salad dressings. There are many very good salad dressings that only have 25 calories per tablespoon. Using those dressings, you can put four tablespoons of salad dressing on your salad and start munching away. In a few minutes, you will feel quite full and yet will have only consumed 100 calories that count. Remember the calories for the green leafy vegetables are free. You only count the calories of the salad dressing itself. This is an excellent way to fill your stomach and turn off your hunger signals while only giving yourself 100 calories. Another strategy that uses green leafy vegetables is to stir fry them in a pan with no oils whatsoever. Just use water and flavoring such as onions, garlic and soy sauce. Simply stir fry all the green vegetables you want, add the spices and eat it. I do not count the calories in onions or garlic either, nor do I count the calories in soy sauce since none of these spices have very high calorie density. As a result, that entire meal goes in your stomach and counts for zero calories. Once again, it's a great way to curb you appetite without consuming large quantities of calorie rich food. Emergency appetite control food #3 This is one of my favorites: I call it my 'instant banana pudding' recipe, but of course, it's nothing at all like store-bought pudding. You'll need a blender for this one. Add a quart of soy milk to the blender, then a couple of scoops of unsweetened banana-flavored simply natural spirutein soy protein powder. (Sources are listed in the downloadable book, 'Secret Sources.' Add stevia powder as the sweetener. I also toss in some supergreens powders, but you may want to avoid that at first, since it's an acquired taste (and it turns your banana pudding green). If you were to blend this up, you'd have a banana-flavored soy protein shake. But we're not done yet: while the blender is running, put in about 1/2 tablespoon of guar gum powder, plus another 1/2 tablespoon of xanthan gum powder. These are thickeners. Within seconds, your blender will start whining and the whole mixture will attain the consistency of pudding. Now just pour it into a bowl and eat it like banana pudding! The mixture has near-zero carbs, no sugars, and is high in soy protein. Plus, it tastes great and fills you up fast. This is my favorite choice for a late-night appetite emergency. You can get guar gum and xanthan gum at a health food store, or order online at a vitamin supplier. Emergency appetite control food #4: The last food is pickles. That's right, pickles. But I am not talking about the pickles you find at a regular grocery store. Nearly all pickles you find in grocery stores contain artificial food coloring. They have a yellowish tint to them that has been added through the use of chemical colors. This is not a natural ingredient and so it is something you want to avoid purchasing. Instead, you want to buy completely natural pickles like the ones you get at Trader Joe's that are made without artificial colors or flavors and that have an extremely low calorie count as well. An entire jar of pickles may give you only 50 calories or so and yet they can be quite satisfying and take up a considerable amount of space in your stomach, thereby turning off your appetite cravings. Just don't buy pickles containing any added sugars or artificial colors. Some pickles are, believe it or not, loaded with sugar. They're more like candied cucumbers than pickles. Read the ingredients labels to be sure what you're getting. By the way, while you're eating pickles, it's an excellent time to take some calcium and mineral supplements, too. The acidity of the pickles will accelerate the absorption of calcium. Emergency appetite control food #5: Here's an easy one: apples. Yep, apples. Eat the largest apple you can find. Sure, you'll get some calories and some carbs, but the apple will fill you up for quite a while, and that will stop you from eating far more calorie-dense foods. Let me explain why this is such an effective strategy. If you're crazy hungry, it's very easy to reach for some processed foods (bag of chips, for example) and start munching away until you've consumed 1000 calories or more. And that's about half the total calories you need for the entire day! But I dare you to try to eat 1000 calories worth of apples. It's impossible. You'll fill up even before reaching 400 calories, probably. Apples are great appetite suppressing foods because the bulky fiber fills up your stomach and turns off your appetite control hormones before you overeat. Plus, apples contain various phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals. They're even a decent source of folic acid. How to further suppress your appetite: One more supplementary strategy to all of this is that you can multiply the appetite suppressing effects of all foods by swallowing a couple of fiber tablets before you begin eating. Fiber tablets or capsules would include psyllium husk, glucomannan, oat bran fiber, apple pectin fiber, or other natural fibers. You can find fiber supplements at any health food store. Be careful to watch the dosage of the fiber and drink plenty of water as you take these pills because without adequate water, they can gum up in your digestive tract and in extreme cases, they can block your digestive tract. So, you want to drink plenty of water with them. By consuming both the fiber and the water before you start eating, you've already significantly turned off your appetite. Then by consuming these extremely low caloric density foods and beverages, you will further suppress your appetite. You can get an entire meal into your stomach for 100 calories or less and you can trick your brain into thinking you consumed an all-you-can-eat buffet. But there's a catch to all this: in about an hour or so, your body will figure out that there isn't much energy in the food you've consumed. Your hunger will begin to return, but at least you delayed the onset of that hunger by an hour or more. If you combine this with physical exercise, you can delay it even further because the very act of exercising releases stored body fat and converts it back into blood sugar, which raises your blood sugar level and suppresses your appetite cravings. You can also extend the effect of this by taking appetite suppressant supplements. Hoodia gordonii is one I've reviewed quite extensively, and it is currently increasing in popularity. My own experience is that hoodia tincture can help, but even hoodia doesn't shut off appetite completely. Also, you don't want to starve yourself by eating these 100-calorie meals all day long. Remember, starvation is the fastest way to train your body to hold on to body fat. These are just items to get you past a difficult time when your appetite is unbearably intense. Each day, you still need to get nutrition into your body in the form of whole foods and whole food supplements. The kind of meals I consume are soups made with quinoa, salads with low-calorie dressing, raw fruits and nuts, or avocado shakes made by blending avocado with soy milk and stevia. Of course, I also consume my superfood shakes on a regular basis. They are made from superfoods green powders such as Berry Green or The Ultimate Meal. Overall, keep in mind that weight loss takes effort. You will experience moments of intense hunger, and these low-calorie, filling foods are one excellent way to get through a difficult time without packing on the pounds. "
0," My grandmother Ester died after suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and for the last 12 years of her life she did not recognize anyone from her immediate family, including her husband, her children or her grandchildren. She became violent in the end, and she basically starved herself to death. The hospital/extended care facility put her on forced IV, but it was too little and way too late. My father said she chewed on antacids (Tums, to be specific) every day to sooth her indigestion, and the aluminum content is so high in most antacids that it is believed to be the number one cause of Alzheimer's -- that slowly and miserably killed her, and she never even knew. We know now! So what are 'we' doing about it? You know, there's aluminum in vaccines and flu shots too. Yep, there's aluminum in your USA tap water, most likely. There's aluminum in imported foods from China, even the certified organic that's imported from there. How much aluminum are YOU consuming daily, or were you paying attention to this? Heavy metal toxins could be your demise if you're not careful. As this goes highly underestimated, the people who don't know who they are and who can't recognize the ones they loved can't speak a word about it. Did you know that Alzheimer's is preventable and even reversible? I doubt you know. Let's cover it now. Nutritionists talk about the pineal gland, melatonin and organic sulfur 'A tiny gland in the center of the brain named the pineal may seem insignificant, but researchers have found it to be vital for physical, mental and, many believe, spiritual health,' explains . 'Through poor diet, exposure to toxins, stress and modern lifestyle choices, the pineal gland becomes hardened, calcified and shuts down. To awaken this gland from its slumber, detoxification is necessary using diet and herbs, sunlight and pure water.' You must remove toxic heavy metals from your food, water and personal care products regimen. Key heavy metals removal info: selfnews.com . Are you taking beta-blockers? Watch out. You could be suppressing your melatonin production! selfnewsRadar.WordPress.com . Get your hair and urine tested! Before you can treat metal toxicity, you need to determine what levels of metals you actually have contaminating your body's tissues. Health Ranger Mike Adams wrote, 'Many metals quickly pass from your blood to your tissues, where they may lodge and cause serious long-term health problems. 'Iron lodged in your heart tissue can cause heart disease. Aluminum lodged in your brain tissue can cause Alzheimer's or clinical insanity. Mercury lodged in your brain can cause autism spectrum disorders. Lead lodged in your bones can interfere with red blood cell production and even white blood cell production.' Aluminum in children's medicine Aluminum Lake food coloring, used to heavily coat liquid medicines for children, contains dangerous amounts of aluminum and harmful synthetic petrochemicals. These 'petrochemicals' are carcinogens which can contain petroleum, antifreeze and ammonia, which cause a long list of adverse reactions. Aluminum poisoning can lead to central nervous system (CNS) damage, like memory impairments, autism, epilepsy, mental retardation and dementia. Research shows that just 4 ppm of aluminum can cause the blood to coagulate. This is what causes Alzheimer's disease! Aluminum consumption can also be associated with the development of bone disorders, including stress fractures. How much do you know about this and the heavy metal content in your foods, drinks, cosmetics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals? You better figure it out fast, before you forget who and where you are!

0," The Big Pharma frenzy over H1N1 vaccines has turned into a circus of hilarious medical quackery thanks to the fact that by the time the vaccines are available, most people will have already been exposed to the virus . Hence, most people will have already built up their own H1N1 antibodies, rendering the vaccine not just useless, but downright laughable. Even with the outlandish rush to get these vaccines approved by the FDA -- a hurry that saw the complete abandonment of the principles of 'scientific testing' -- Big Pharma just couldn't get these vaccines produced quickly enough to beat the virus itself. Taking a vaccine shot after you've already been exposed is medically useless. It's equivalent to putting on your seat belt after getting into a car wreck. Even U.S. News & World Report , which is heavily funded by Big Pharma advertising, is now admitting the swine flu outbreak may be over before the vaccines arrive. It reports: 'Richard Wenzel, an H1N1 expert and former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, predicts that the outbreak will last another four to eight weeks before tapering off. In fact, some areas in the South already are seeing a decline in cases. Given that the vaccine will be produced in limited quantities on a rolling basis, most healthy middle-aged adults -- who the government recommends should be vaccinated after children, college students, and pregnant women -- won't be getting immunized before the outbreaks peak and wane.' ( http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/inf... ) Did you catch the significance of that last sentence? Most people won't be getting immunized before the outbreak tapers off. And that means the whole reason for getting the vaccine in the first place -- to avoid being killed by an exploding pandemic -- will soon be rendered pointless. Leave it to western medicine to act all heroic, pretending to be saving people's lives from a pandemic that's already on the way out... Maintaining the illusion Of course, infectious disease reality never got in the way of Big Pharma making a buck, so this inane vaccine push will continue whether people need it or not . All these vaccines have already been ordered and paid for with taxpayer dollars. Delivery is on the way, and there are no refunds. If cities, states and nations don't use all these vaccines, they'll look pretty darned stupid for buying them, won't they? That's why health authorities everywhere are determined to use up these vaccines regardless of medical reality. And that means finding enough willing children and adults to be injected. Following that, as the swine flu pandemic fades away (which it was going to do anyway), all the vaccine-pushing health authorities can proclaim, 'We did it! We beat the pandemic with the vaccines!' But the pandemic was burning out on its own, without any intervention at all. Of course, taking credit for solving problems they didn't really solve is nothing new to the vaccine industry. To this day, the drug companies credit themselves with eradicating smallpox, measles and yellow fever when, in reality, the historical record shows that it was primarily improvements in hygiene and public infrastructure that caused these once-terrible epidemics to wane. The transition from open ditches filled with feces to underground public sewage pipes was, all by itself, one of modern civilization's greatest achievements in terms of reducing infectious disease. Running water, public water treatment systems and sewage processing technologies deserve most of the credit for eradicating infectious disease. Vaccines have relatively little to do with it. If you let the pharmaceutical industry write the history books, they make it sound like our modern world would have collapsed into a cesspool of disease without their vaccines. It's fiction, of course, but it's the kind of fiction that goes over well with a society that maintains an almost fanatical belief in the bizarre mythology of unproven chemical interventions. To this day, there remains absolutely no credible scientific evidence that H1N1 vaccines work at all . Not a single placebo-controlled study has ever been conducted on them! Speaking of rewriting the history books, Big Pharma will no doubt seek to rewrite the history of the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, too. Even if the flu fades out just as the vaccines arrive, the vaccine pushers will claim credit for eradicating the pandemic by blurring the factual timelines. They'll add swine flu to the list of diseases they claim to have eradicated, like the measles. The real story here is that swine flu never posed a real threat to humanity , and it would have gone away on its own, even without the vaccines. Tens of millions of people have already been exposed and subsequently built their own H1N1 antibodies. And guess what? Their immune systems did it for free. No needles required. Amazing! "
0," Good news for patients with both migraines and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): an elimination diet done using the body's actual reactions to potential allergens as the primary trigger foods avoided. A recent randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial in Turkey found that an elimination diet based on the blood's levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in reaction to 270 common food allergens helped alleviate the frequency and severity of migraine attacks and IBS-related symptoms in people with both conditions. This study , performed at the Acibadem University School of Medicine in Istanbul, helped relieve almost every aspect of migraine and IBS attacks. Migraines came less frequently and were less serious, requiring less medication and allowing sufferers to get back to their daily lives almost twice as quickly as those without the targeted elimination diets. IBS symptoms of pain and bloating also happened less frequently and - when they did occur - were less severe. Those on the elimination diet also reported a significant improvement in quality of life. Common trigger foods for migraines and IBS No two people with migraines and IBS will have the same list of foods that seem to aggravate symptoms. Despite the personal variation in trigger foods, there are common foods and food groups that frequently cause problems for individuals with these health conditions. Gluten and grains . Insoluble fiber can cause abdominal pain in some and relieve constipation in others, but as many as 50 percent or more of IBS patients also have gluten intolerance. Gluten can also cause headaches and migraines in individuals with gluten intolerance or allergy. Avoiding gluten and grain-based foods may help alleviate symptoms of both conditions. Dairy. Milk, cheese, and other dairy products may cause a number of uncomfortable symptoms for those with IBS and migraine problems. Bloating and diarrhea can result from lactose intolerance as well as the fatty content in many dairy products, and individuals with strong gastrointestinal reactions to dairy may also experience problems with migraines or other body systems. Caffeine. Although some individuals with IBS may appreciate coffee for its potential use as a 'regulator' - as well as for the energy buzz - coffee and other caffeinated beverages (and foods like chocolate) can disturb both the gastrointestinal tract and the blood vessels in the brain. Some individuals with migraines experience significant relief when caffeine is eliminated from the diet. In order to customize an elimination diet most effectively, consider requesting information on an IgG-based antibody test for the most common food allergens. Follow the advice of a health professional when beginning an elimination diet to ensure proper nutrition in the interim. If an elimination and challenge process successfully reveals a food or food group as a culprit of IBS and migraine symptoms, ask a dietitian how to adjust to the new diet to replace nutritional benefits of the 'lost' foods. "
0," With modern lifestyles, people are exposed to multiple carcinogenic agents on a daily basis. It is hence no wonder that cancer rates are soaring. To keep far away from this terrifying disease, below is a list of cancer foods that cannot be ignored. 1. Flavonoid-rich berries These berries include currants, cherries, cranberries, hawthorn berries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. As powerful antioxidants, flavonoids can be more potent than traditional antioxidants like vitamin C and E, beta-carotene, selenium and zinc. And antioxidants are well-known to be crucial in the prevention of cancer. So pop a berry or two daily as a snack, rather than the nutrition-less sweets, for optimal cancer protection. 2. Turmeric Love curry? Curry is one of the delicious foods that protect against cancer , if it contains turmeric. This is because turmeric contains the phytonutrient, curcumin, which has been found to be anti-inflammatory and cancer-inhibiting. 3. Cruciferous vegetables These vegetables include cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, cress, horseradish, kohlrabi, mustard, radish and turnip. They are beneficial because they contain the phytonutrient, glucosinolates, which has been found to detoxify certain carcinogens and help lower cancer risk, especially colon cancer. 4. Garlic Garlic contains about 200 biologically active compounds, such as sulfur containing amino-acids, glutathione and cysteine, that have powerful protective functions against cancer formation, growth and metastasis. For the best effect, garlic should be eaten freshly chopped and raw. But if the smell and taste of raw garlic is really intolerable, it could be lightly stir-fried with vegetables, or boiled in soups. 5. Mushrooms Mushrooms aren't only tasty to eat, they can also protect one from cancer. At least some mushrooms can. Like the reishi (Ganoderma), shiitake and maitake, which the Chinese and Japanese have been using for ages to boost immunity, protect against as well as treat cancer. 6. Yogurt Various species of probiotics (eg. Bifidobacterium lactis) present in yoghurt have been found to improve immunity and detoxify many carcinogens, including hormones, meat carcinogens and environmental toxins. 7. Spinach Many people formed their impression of spinach from watching the cartoon Popeye as a kid. But is this green food as wonderful as it is portrayed to be? Long reputed for increasing power and energy, spinach is also an anti-cancer food because of its richness in chlorophyll and carotene. Besides protecting one from cancer, it is also rich in iron, folic acid, vitamins and minerals, as well as the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (which has anti-aging properties). If there's only one green vegetable to be eaten, then it must be spinach. 8. Fiber-rich foods Fiber in plant foods are important not only for healthy bowels, they are also important for preventing colorectal cancer. Fiber facilitates the movement of food through the digestive tract, so there is less time for any carcinogens in one's food to be absorbed, and less carcinogens are produced by the 'rotting' food in the gut as it passes through. Whole grains (e.g. unpolished rice), beans, seeds, lentils and vegetables make rich sources of fiber, so be sure to include them in the daily meals. 9. Bee propolis Propolis is a substance produced by bees to protect themselves and their hives against bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Rich in bioflavonoids, vitamins and amino acids, it has been found to be immunity-enhancing and cancer-preventing. "
0," Federal intelligence agencies aren't the only ones secretly collecting sensitive private information about American citizens these days; it's happening on the local level as well. The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) has released information it obtained in a lawsuit regarding the use of 'Stingray' technology by the Erie County Sheriff's Office to track the location of citizens through their cellphones. Stingrays are devices that act as cell tower simulators, allowing a user to pinpoint the physical location of a person via their cellphone. The technology is also capable of collecting the phone numbers that a person has dialed or texted. In certain circumstances, it can even spy on the contents of communications. The NYCLU is concerned over the use of this technology due to its intrusive nature and the fact it can be used to collect private information about innocent people. There are also deeper concerns. In order to obtain the $350,000, taxpayer-funded surveillance system, the Erie County Sheriff's Office was required to sign a confidentiality agreement with the FBI. This agreement includes stipulations that require the sheriff's office to operate the equipment in almost complete secrecy. There is even a clause allowing the FBI to request that the sheriff's office dismiss any criminal cases that might compromise the secrecy regarding how the Stingray is used. NYCLU Staff Attorney Mariko Hirose said: These records confirm some of the very worst fears about local law enforcement's use of this expensive and intrusive surveillance equipment. Not only did the Sheriff's Office promise the FBI breathtaking secrecy to keep information about stingrays as hidden as possible, it implemented almost no privacy protections for the Erie County residents it is sworn to protect and serve. Records released by the sheriff's office show that in the period between May 1, 2010, and October 3, 2014, the Stingray was used at least 47 times. In some of these instances, the technology was used to help other nearby law enforcement agencies. However, permission was granted to use the Stingray through a court order in only one case. This runs contrary to statements made by the sheriff claiming that 'judicial review' was implemented each time the device was used. As Hirose noted: These records confirm some of the very worst fears about local law enforcement's use of this expensive and intrusive surveillance equipment. Not only did the Sheriff's Office promise the FBI breathtaking secrecy to keep information about stingrays as hidden as possible, it implemented almost no privacy protections for the Erie County residents it is sworn to protect and serve. The NYCLU claims that at least one criminal case has been dismissed over use of the Stingray, although the sheriff's office denies it. One of the questions raised by the NYCLU addresses the usefulness of this 'expensive and intrusive' technology if cases are likely to be dismissed. As NYCLU Western Region Director John Curr III put it: If the FBI can command the Sheriff's Office to dismiss criminal cases to protect its secret stingrays, it is not clear how the $350,000 we are spending on stingray equipment is keeping the people of Buffalo safer. In a report on the use of Stingrays and the potential threat to privacy, the NYCLU observed that this technology can be used to 'pinpoint a person's location in the home, a place of worship or a doctor's office, or conduct mass surveillance on people gathered in an area, whether for a protest, lecture or a party.' Even when used to collect information on a single suspect, the Stingray might also inadvertently gather information on innocent people in the vicinity. It appears that once again, our liberties and rights to privacy are being eroded incrementally in the name of law and order by those who consider themselves above the rule of law.

0," Even as hospitals in Germany are now filling up with people sickened by a super-powerful drug-resistant 'superbug' strain of e.coli that looks like it was bioengineered ( http://www.selfnews.com/032622_ecoli_bioe... ), European health authorities are leaping at the opportunity to spread fear about organic foods while ignoring the obvious true cause of the contamination in the first place -- the widespread abuse of antibiotics in animal farming operations. The e.coli blame game has become a circus of musical chairs. First, they blamed the Spaniards as a form of retaliation for Spain's resistance to accepting GMOs ( http://www.selfnews.com/030828_GMOs_Wikil... ). This act drove Spanish farmers into bankruptcy through a savage campaign of rumor-mongering. After ravaging the Spanish vegetable farmers, they began to randomly instill widespread fear about a variety of vegetables: First it was cucumbers, then lettuce and then finally tomatoes. And now, the blame has come full circle and is now being cast upon organic sprout growers in Germany! This has all been nothing more than despicable rumor-mongering that has now reached the point of economic warfare against vegetable farmers. And now it turns out even the latest round of blame cast upon sprouts was completely fraudulent: New tests reveal that the organic sprouts are NOT contaminated with e.coli . The Wall Street Journal is now reporting: 'The Lower-Saxony state agriculture ministry said 23 of 40 samples from the sprout farm suspected of being behind the outbreak have tested negative for the highly aggressive, 'super-toxic' strain of E. coli bacteria... In a surprising U-turn, German officials said initial tests published Monday provided no evidence that sprouts from an organic farm in northern Germany were the cause of the country's deadly Escherichia coli outbreak.' ( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB100014240527... ) Huh? Weren't these sprouts being blamed as the source of the outbreak up until yesterday? Economic warfare and irrational fear-mongering The truth is that we are witnessing an economic blame game run amok as health authorities destroy trust in one vegetable crop after another. It has become an episode of Godzilla, with the monster of German health authorities rampaging through the city, crushing vegetable farmers left and right by merely uttering the name of what they grow. CUCUMBERS! No, wait. Now it's TOMATOES! Hold on, nope. It's actually SPROUTS! Wait a sec. Nope, not that either... This has all become a circus of nonsense that translates into the economic devastation of vegetable growers. And that's the whole point, actually: To demonize fresh vegetables and convince people that the only safe food is dead food . So through this campaign of destructive rumor-mongering, European health authorities can steer people away from eating the very things that help keep them healthy: Fresh vegetables and sprouts, all of which contain natural medicines and phytonutrients that prevent diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. By scaring people away from these fresh vegetables, they are pushing people toward less healthful options: Processed foods, dead foods, pasteurized beverages and fumigated or irradiated vegetables. Across both the EU and the USA, this is what health regulators have been deviously pushing for the last few years. All it takes is a few engineered e.coli scares to convince the public to avoid nearly all fresh vegetables! Already, sales of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and sprouts have plummeted across Europe... even though there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that these vegetables are the source of the e.coli contamination. Astonishingly, virtually the entire public is now increasingly convinced that the only SAFE foods are processed foods! Yep: Beware of fresh veggies because they might kill you! Instead, eat your GMO-contaminated, pesticide-ridden processed dead foods because that's safe! This is the incredible conclusion of the war being waged against fresh vegetables -- a war that is now using bioengineered weapons in the food supply to create fear and cause fatalities among innocent consumers.

0," A healthy, radiant and smooth looking skin is something we all desire. We spend a fortune on expensive lotions, masks and creams that promise us the most amazing results. Unfortunately, most of these commercially available skincare products are loaded with chemicals that do more harm than good . In our longing for eternal youth, we often forget that beauty and a healthy looking skin come from the inside. We are what we eat. What we put in our mouths does matter, and will reflect on our skins. Diets loaded with processed foods, sugar and unhealthy fats leave the skin looking and feeling dull, oily and discolored. Our skins reveal the stories of our lives. A nourished body fueled with whole foods and packed with skin-boosting vitamins, is the only way to glow from the inside out. Here are five very important skin-boosting vitamins, and where to find them, to make your skin glow like never before. Five essential vitamins for a healthy skin Vitamin A Vitamin A is necessary to maintain and repair skin tissue. It keeps the skin elastic and hydrated, and prevents premature ageing . Vitamin A deficiency can lead to a dry, flaky complexion, and can cause acne and wrinkles, too. To make sure you get enough of this vitally important nutrient, make sure to eat plenty of vitamin A rich foods, such as mango, papaya, apricot, squash, carrots, sweet potato and dark leafy greens. Vitamin B complex Biotin, or vitamin B7, is essential to hair, nail and skin health. While our own bodies produce biotin in the liver and the kidneys, it is important to also get it through the food we eat. Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is another important member of the vitamin B complex that improves circulation and promotes skin hydration. Deficiencies can cause skin itchiness, rashes, brittle nails and hair loss. Vitamins of the B complex can be found in eggs, salmon, cauliflower, carrots, whole grains and bananas. Vitamin C Vitamin C, known to prevent colds and boost the immune system, protects the skin against premature ageing too. It stimulates collagen production to keep the skin supple and toned. As we age, our need for vitamin C increases. Fill up on citrus fruits, berries, grapes, leafy greens, bell peppers and cauliflower, to make sure you get enough of it to help reduce wrinkles, improve skin texture and reduce photodamage. Vitamin E Vitamin E is a free radical fighter that slows down the ageing of skin cells and restores their moisture balance. Topical use of vitamin E oil works wonders to reduce the appearance of scar tissue and soften dry, rough skin. For a smooth, soft and supple skin, add vitamin E rich foods, such as olives, nuts and leafy greens to your diet. Vitamin K Vitamin K, often referred to as the forgotten vitamin, is an important nutrient to reduce wrinkles and the appearance of bruises and dark circles under the eyes. Dark, leafy greens are the best way to meet your needs. Or try topical use to maximize the skin boosting effect. To make sure you look at your best, include these nutrients in your daily diet, use natural skincare products, and protect your skin against the sun's UV rays.

0," The internet is no longer the only open-source communication medium that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is trying to censor. The Alliance for Natural Health - USA (ANH-USA) reports that the FDA is now going after 'smartphones' by trying to force mobile 'app' developers to gain pre-approval from the rogue federal agency before being allowed to publish certain health- and medicine-related apps for public use. Based on the language in an agency draft guidance issued last summer for public review, the FDA appears poised to begin regulating medical mobile apps as if they were medical devices , which means they would be subject to the agency's extensive regulatory approval process before being made available in mobile app stores. And since medical devices are largely regulated in the same way that drugs are, medical mobile apps will essentially be treated as though they too are drugs. This latest regulatory attack comes as health-related mobile phone apps are literally exploding across the smartphone landscape. There are now thousands of smartphone apps that help people track calorie intake, log exercise routines, obtain nutrition advice, and even self-regulate things like blood sugar levels. The medical app market, according to ANH-USA, is growing by a whopping 25 percent annually, more than any other app category. What this means is that more people than ever are taking control of their own health, and using their smartphones as a convenient way to make better health decisions. But the FDA apparently does not approve of this, especially since it cannot extract user fees from this market segment under the current regulatory paradigm. So the agency is now trying to change the law in order to get its hands on this lucrative market. FDA regulation of smartphone apps will stifle innovation, further erode freedom of health speech The FDA's justification for attempting to inject itself into the mobile app business is that certain apps essentially turn a smartphone into a medical device, it says, which makes them subject to FDA jurisdiction. But the criteria used to determine whether or not a medical mobile app is also a medical device is somewhat ambiguous, particularly as it concerns users' ability to input specific health information for customized output. Put another way, the FDA essentially wants to regulate any mobile app that provides specific, health-related information to users in a customized way. So while an app that keeps track of how many miles a user runs and calculates related calorie loss would be exempt, an app that allows a user to calculate which dietary supplements he could benefit from based on his specific health profile might be considered off limits apart from official FDA approval. 'Given the FDA's bias against alternative medicine, a pre-approval process for apps will very likely ensure that we won't see many that are focused on natural health,' says ANH-USA. 'An app, for example, that measures daily recommended intake for vitamins and minerals would adhere to the standards of conventional medicine rather than the nutrient standards recommended by integrative physicians.' Such regulations will also significantly stifle innovation , as it will be far too expensive for many mobile developers to gain FDA approval for their apps. Many of them will also likely be confused as to whether or not their apps even need FDA approval in the first place, as the proposed scope of enforcement is somewhat vague and open to interpretation. The draft guidance specifically states, for instance, that exempted apps cannot be intended to cure, treat, seek treatment for mitigating, or diagnose any disease, disorder, 'patient state,' or any specific, identifiable health condition. Based on the FDA's extensive record of tyranny against supplement manufacturers using such legal terms, it seems obvious that the FDA will attempt to use such language to hamper all mobile apps that try to share truthful, unbiased health information with the public.

0," Most people, even smart people, know surprisingly little about the way money really works in Big Government. With the debt ceiling fiasco suddenly raising awareness of the possibility of a total global financial blowout, now seems like a good time to remind people of seven disturbing facts about money that are almost never acknowledge in the old media. Fact #1 - There is no FDIC insurance fund. The money at your bank is insured against loss by the FDIC's insurance fund, right? Nope. That's total fiction. There is no actual money in the fund . The FDIC insurance money has already been looted by the U.S. Treasury which has simply replaced the money with a bunch of IOUs. Why does this matter? Because it means that if the U.S. government goes into default, so will the FDIC! And that means all your bank funds have zero insurance . That's gonna be a big shock for tens of millions of people when they finally figure this out one day... Fact #2 - There are no social security funds, either. When you pay social security taxes, all that money goes into a trust fund that's held for safekeeping until the day it pays you back, right? Ha! That's the 'sucker's view' of social security that only ignorant people believe. In reality, there is no money in the social security trust fund because it too has all been looted by the U.S. Treasury and spent. In truth, social security is already broke. Can't wait for people to wake up and figure this one out, either... Fact #3 - The U.S. Treasury is stealing money from you every day, even if you pay no taxes! Here's a mind-boggling truth that most people just can't seem to get their heads around: The U.S. Treasury is stealing money from you every single day by the simple fact that they keep creating new money and handing it out to wealthy banksters. Well, technically this is being done by the Federal Reserve, which isn't even part of the federal government . But it's all done in cahoots with the Treasury, which is eroding the value of your money through these money creation and distribution actions. That's why prices keep going up all around you, folks: Food isn't suddenly worth more money; the truth is that your money is worth less! That's how the Treasury and the Federal Reserve steal from you without even breaking into your home. Probably 99.9% of the population has no understanding of this phenomenon -- the erosion of currency valuation through the centralized government printing of more currency. And yet it is a government scam that has been carried out against citizens of the world time and time again, spanning millennia! As history has clearly shown, every nation that goes down the path of printing more currency to pay its bills eventually ends up in a runaway hyperinflation scenario followed by economic collapse. The USA will be no different. Fact #4 - The 'balanced solution' isn't balanced. Don't you love the quirky White House Press Secretary who keeps spewing out the phrase 'balanced solution' even while the debt deal leaves the U.S. budget entirely unbalanced? When you're spending more money than you're earning, that's not financial balance. When the White House says 'balanced' what it really means is 'compromised' -- as in, half way between the Republican position (spend us into purgatory) and the Democratic position (spend us into oblivion). Neither party has any real solution to the cancerous growth of Big Government. That's because they are creatures of Big Government! Politicians can no more solve the problems of Big Government than arsonists can solve the problem of office fires. Because they are, themselves, creatures of runaway debt spending (how else do you get elected these days?), they simply do not possess the cognitive framework from which real financial solutions must stem. Fact #5 - The government is going to steal everything from you before it collapses Oh my, this is a tough one for people to get their heads around... especially those who naively trust governments to act in the interests of the People. The simple truth of the matter -- and I've publicly made this prediction before -- is that the government is going to STEAL almost everything you own as it heads toward a total financial implosion. This will include: The government theft of private retirement accounts. The feds will claim they're taking them over 'for your protection.' Yeah, right. And then one day they will simply all vanish. Kiss your IRA goodbye... The government theft of precious metals. Within the next 3 years, watch for a national emergency to be declared, followed by government confiscation of gold and silver . The feds will take your gold and hand you paper money in exchange. The paper money, of course, will be all but worthless shortly thereafter. Only the suckers, of course, will actually turn in their metals... Government takeover of your bank accounts. As banks begin to fail in the big collapse, the government will step in and take ownership of the failed institutions, just as it did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which used to be publicly-owned companies but are now largely just government finance operations). This will put your bank accounts under the direct control of the White House, which can use executive orders to do things like banning all wire transfers out of the country or limiting daily withdrawals and transfers. Sure, you'll still 'own' your money in the bank, you just won't be able to freely access it! Fact #6 - Most people have no idea about fractional reserve banking, derivatives, the money supply or the Federal Reserve It's not just that most people don't understand banking and finance; it's that even members of Congress have no idea how all this works. With few exceptions (like Ron Paul), they're just clueless! Get this: Even most bankers don't even know how fractional reserve banking really works. They don't understand derivatives, either, which is why they screwed them up so badly in the housing boom that crashed in 2007. And because bankers, investors and bureaucrats have no idea how it all works, they unwittingly turn it all into a runaway catastrophe. Allowing ignorant adults to play with debt and derivatives is like letting infants play with nuclear weapons . It can only lead to something messy. Fact #7 - Most people are betting their lives on the dollar People buy insurance for their cars, their homes and even their health. But when it comes to money, 99 out of 100 people in America are betting their entire financial existence on the U.S. dollar! They get their paychecks in dollars, their savings accounts are in dollars, and all their assets are denominated in dollars. As a result, they have no diversity to protect them against dollar devaluation. That's kinda crazy, considering just how quickly the dollar could collapse in the near future and become totally worthless. That's why smart people are diversifying their assets and converting dollars into land, gold, silver or even storable food . Here in central Texas, even ammunition has a long-term barter value that far exceeds dollars. Looking around at the financial behaviors of others, I'm just stunned at how many people are betting everything on the dollar because they never realized they had any other option (that's the way the government likes to keep it, of course!). RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Coming soon: A huge national finance education of the masses Mark my words, folks: The great financial collapse of America is now closer than ever. While I can't put an exact prediction date on it, there's absolutely no doubt that it's coming. The morons in Washington aren't doing anything to avoid it, either -- they're all just cashing in as much as they can before the big collapse rolls in. Bunch of cowards and crooks running this country. They don't understanding banking and finance, and they're determined to make sure you don't either . Because the less you know about what's really going on, the longer they can continue to loot the U.S. economy while people stand around and do nothing. How bad is the situation, really? Just yesterday, Vice President Joe Biden called Congressional Tea Party members 'terrorists' for their insistence that the U.S. budget be balanced. So now, the mere idea of calling for a balanced budget turns you into a 'terrorist' to be prosecuted under the Patriot Act. And why not? Demanding financial sanity MUST be labeled an act of terrorism for our criminal government to continue its own criminal looting operation. Next we'll probably see the President ordering the arrest and prosecution of any members of Congress -- i.e. 'terrorists' -- who do not go along with unlimited increased in the debt ceiling. Now you see what the terrorism laws are really all about: They are legislative weapons to be used against political enemies , not actual terrorists. Meanwhile, Big Government is technically engaged in the use of financial weapons of mass destruction against the People, yet no one notices. A bizarre world we live in, folks. It is dominated by the mindless masses and run by criminal sociopaths. Those who demand real solutions are labeled terrorists, and those who try to explain all this to everybody else are labeled 'alarmists.' Just wait until this house of cards collapses, though. There will be a day of reckoning in which a whole bunch of apologies will be owed to all those people who tried to warn the nation what was really happening (and where it would lead us). "
0," Once again, employees of the nation's most worthless federal agency, the Transportation Security Administration, are in trouble with the law for allegedly committing a sexually abusive act against a passenger. According to the local CBS affiliate, Denver police have launched a sexual assault investigation against TSA screeners who work at a checkpoint at the Denver International Airport. The report says the investigation began recently, after a Colorado woman filed a complaint, saying a pat-down and frisk she received there was akin to sexual assault. 'It's an open and active investigation,' Denver police spokesperson Sonny Jackson said. 'We take all complaints seriously and we are on this case as well. We have launched an investigation into it.' As reported by CBS4 : The criminal probe stems from a complaint filed by Jamelyn Steenhoek, 39, who was patted down by TSA agents on Dec. 26 as she was escorting her 13-year-old daughter to a flight bound for Philadelphia. Steenhoek was not flying, just getting her daughter to the gate. 'I feel like someone who works for a powerful agency that we are afraid of used their power to violate me sexually - to put me in my place,' Steenhoek, a full-time college student and a working mother for a county social services department, told the local station. After finding nothing, the agent repeated the groping Though she had proper credentials to escort her daughter to the airline gate, an alarm sounded at the TSA checkpoint when she passed through. The humiliated mother said she believes the checkpoint metal detector sounded after picking up jewels that were sewn into the rear pockets of her blue jeans. When the alarm sounded, TSA agents at the checkpoint asked if she would agree to have her hands swabbed, which she did. 'Then they told me I tested positive for explosives,' Steenhoek said, adding that she told the agents that the positive probably stemmed from earlier in the day when she had pumped gas into her vehicle. 'She said, 'We'll have to do a search.' So I thought, 'Okay,'' Steenhoek said. Steenhoek told the station she was focused on simply getting the search over with and getting to the gate with her daughter, with enough time to spare in order to get the daughter a bite to eat before her flight departed. She said she was then ushered away to a small private room at the checkpoint, with her daughter watching from a few feet away. 'They told me to spread my arms and spread my feet,' Steenhoek said, noting that the female TSA agent conducting the search appeared to become agitated as Steenhoek tried to hurry the process along - so she could get her child to her gate. 'At that point she did a pretty invasive search,' she said. 'They are just areas of the body I'm not comfortable being touched in. On the outside of my pants she cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that.' The embarrassed mother also said the TSA agent repeatedly dug her fingers into Steenhoek's armpits as well. 'The part of the search that bothered most was the breast search,' she explained. 'You could tell it shouldn't take that much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician - full touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.' 'You want one or more of them to be charged?' Worse, though the initial invasive search turned up nothing, the agent nevertheless repeated the procedure. 'So it didn't make any sense. The whole search was done over and more touching and grabbing than the first time,' Steenhoek said. Finally, the Gestapo - er, I mean, the TSA agent - released Steenhoek without finding anything suspicious, dangerous or prohibited. She managed to get her daughter to her gate on time. Steenhoek said she made a complaint to TSA management about her treatment, but like so many abused Americans before her, she didn't believe she was going to get any satisfaction. So, three days later, she went to the Denver Police Department and filed a complaint against the as-yet-unnamed female TSA agent who conducted the search. 'I was looking for consequences, for TSA to be accountable for what they do to people,' Steenhoek told CBS4 . 'You want one or more of them to be charged with sexual assault ?' she said she was asked. 'I do,' Steenhoek responded. Police officials say they will submit the complaint to the district attorney, to see if there is enough evidence to file charges. As often as this kind of nonsense has happened already, I'm not holding my breath that anyone at the TSA will be held to account.

0," As you might have expected, the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington State this year has created new markets for pot-infused products, not the least of which are snacks and treats that customers eat to get high. According to a recent New York Times report, stores that sell marijuana-laced goodies like watermelon dew drops, mandarin elixers and chocolate truffles are now having a tough time keeping enough inventory on hand. 'The stuff just flies off the shelves,' Linda Andrews, owner of LoDo Wellness Center, one of Colorado's newest recreational marijuana stores, told the paper. The Times further notes: As marijuana tiptoes further toward the legal mainstream, marijuana-infused snacks have become a booming business, with varieties ranging from chocolate-peppermint Mile High Bars to peanut butter candies infused with hash oil. Retail shops see them as a nonthreatening way into the shallow end of the marijuana pool, ideal for older customers, tourists staying in smoke-free hotels or anyone who wants the effect without the smoke and coughing. Support for 'childhood packaging' of pot-infused edibles But as the popularity - and resultant use - of such products grows, there is mounting concern from some groups, doctors, schools and parents that the products could find their way into the hands of children and teens, the latter of whom might be looking for a discreet way to get high. As such, there have been some steps taken already to keep pot-infused products out of the wrong hands. Colorado, for example, has ordered stores to sell products in child-resistant containers. And, like other states that offer medicinal or recreational pot, products are not permitted to be labeled in a manner that appeals to kids. Also, serving sizes, ingredients and expiration dates are to be placed on packages by manufacturers. Advocates for smart marijuana-use laws support those measures. Evan Nison, executive director of NORML New Jersey , a group which supports repealing anti-pot laws, told selfnews that he supports 'childhood packaging of edibles.' 'Simple regulations like these are one of the benefits of legalization. If we require age verification and correct packaging, these sorts of situations can be avoided,' he said. 'We can strengthen regulations and learn from the experiences of Colorado and Washington to make sure we have the most responsible cannabis industry possible.' But critics contend that the measures don't go far enough, especially for products that contain as much as 10 times the psychoactive THC that a casual pot smoker might ingest. 'They're attractive to kids; they're easily disguised,' Gina Carbone of Smart Colorado, a group that opposes legalization, told the Times . 'They're not being regulated properly at all to protect kids.' 'People understandably have serious concerns' Kamy Akhavan , president and managing editor of ProCon.org , a non-partisan group that provides research and data from both sides of the marijuana issue, told selfnews that, in all 20 states where medical marijuana use is permitted, officials 'restrict medical marijuana sales to people 18 years or older.' But in several of them, 'states allow for minors to consume medical marijuana with parental and physician approval.' And in New Jersey, he noted, state law actually 'specifies that edibles can be sold to minors but only if they have parental permission and approval from a pediatrician and a psychiatrist.' That could be part of the problem, contend experts, who note that an increasing number of children are being treated for accidental THC ingestion. As reported by the Times : The children, many of them toddlers, were taken in because they seemed strangely sleepy and disoriented. One had trouble breathing. About half had eaten marijuana cookies, cakes or candies, forms that researchers believed made them more enticing. 'Those edible products are inherently more attractive than what a bud would look like,' Dr. George Sam Wang, co-author of a 2013 study that examined the number of children who were taken to emergency departments due to accidental THC ingestion in the Denver area from October 2009 through December 2011. Akhavan says the concerns are not unfounded. 'People understandably have serious concerns and questions about marijuana and its impact on health and society,' he told selfnews . Especially its unintended consequences for kids. Sources: http://www.nytimes.com http://www.normlnj.org/ http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org "
0," Move over methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), there is a new 'superbug' in town. Reports from CBS 2 in Los Angeles say that a deadly new bacteria known as CRKP is rapidly making the rounds in hospitals and care facilities throughout Southern California. According to reports, the bacteria has no known cure, and it may never have one. CRKP, also known as Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, is not actually a new superbug. As early as 2006, it was known to have spread throughout an Israeli hospital, and shortly thereafter to every hospital in Israel ( http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/554704 ). And now, it is becoming a serious problem worldwide. ABC 7 in Los Angeles quotes its own Dr. Richard Besser who stated that CRKP is 'very fatal' and that it kills roughly 40 percent of people who contract it ( http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=ne... ). And reports indicate that 350 people in the Los Angeles area already became infected with CRKP within a seven-month time frame last year. Some experts are blaming a lack of new antibiotic drug development as the reason why CRKP and other superbugs are allegedly incurable. But inquiry into superbugs has actually revealed that overuse of antibiotics is to blame for their existence in the first place, whether it is humans taking too many antibiotics for minor ailments, or factory farmers giving them to animals to accelerate their growth and cover up filthy, disease-ridden conditions. Last year, a study published in the journal Science revealed that superbugs appear to be the direct descendants of mutated bacteria created as a result of the introduction of synthetic antibiotic drugs. By analyzing the course of mutation of MRSA over the years, scientists were able to pinpoint antibiotics and their overuse as the primary culprit ( http://www.selfnews.com/028479_superbugs_... ). When taken by humans, antibiotics actually destroy all the good bacteria in the gut along with the bad, which ends up destroying proper immune function. Without balanced and healthy gut flora, the body is essentially crippled from being able to ward off harmful pathogens, including deadly superbugs ( http://www.selfnews.com/superbugs.html ).

0," In a shocking reversal of its previous position on the matter, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is supposed to be a consumer watchdog group that works on behalf of citizen interests, has arbitrarily decided that cloned animal food is safe, and that it can be sold without proper labeling. Just days before making this complete about-face, FSA had purported that there was not enough evidence that cloned food was safe to support its approval. Caving to what appears to have been immense pressure from other UK government agencies, as well as the various companies that stand to benefit from cloning, the FSA and its flip-flop decision have caused a significant uproar. After all, FSA's previous claims are true that proper safety studies are lacking, how can the agency suddenly claim there is no evidence that cloned food is any different than natural food? Back in February, UK Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Jim Paice expressed his opinion that cloned food is no different than natural food, and suggested that no restrictions be applied to its sale. Such statements, of course, have no scientific backing whatsoever, but the European Commission has also expressed the very same sentiments ( http://www.selfnews.com/031528_cloned_mil... ). On the contrary, all available evidence shows that cloned animals are, in fact, very different from natural animals. A 13-year research project involving cloned animals in New Zealand was actually ended because virtually all the cloned animals involved were deformed, became gravely ill at an early age, or they flat-out died ( http://www.selfnews.com/031573_cloning_an... ). So how can anyone push food made from such creatures on the public? Purely from the perspective of popular opinion, roughly 80 percent of UK shoppers surveyed indicated they oppose cloned food . So FSA's new policy is nothing but a slap in the face to consumers who will now have no choice in deciding the foods they eat, just like Americans have no choice in consuming unlabeled genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). Numerous organic and consumer groups, including the UK Soil Association, have expressed outrage over FSA's policy reversal. And responding to consumer outcry, most major UK grocers have already pledged not to use cloned materials in any of their store-brand products.

0," The cancer industry has apparently become so desperate to recruit new customers that it is now resorting to what can only be described as a type of medical date rape. A number of hospitals and cancer centers across the country are reportedly now holding community-driven 'mammogram parties,' a deceptive cancer marketing scheme that basically entails deliberately getting women tipsy or drunk on alcohol with their friends and neighbors in order to entice them into getting medically molested via mammograms. The horrendous bait and switch tactic is taking place under the guise of 'saving lives,' as it is specifically designed for women who feel uncomfortable with getting mammograms, and who would otherwise avoid getting them if it were not for the added pressure of being wined and dined in a comfortable and relaxing environment. Women are being encouraged to 'grab their girlfriends' for a night out at the local cancer center, during which time they take turns getting blasted with ionizing radiation in between munching down fancy cheeses and chocolate fondue, and sipping down delectable wine. 'It may be a good way to improve compliance and make having a mammogram more enjoyable,' claimed Dr. Julie Silver, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School , to ABC News about the disturbing mammogram party phenomenon. Are mammogram parties an organized form of medical date rape? It is interesting that Dr. Silver would use the word 'compliance' in conjunction with mammograms, as the word is generally used in reference to someone giving an order or command to do something. This, combined with the fact that cancer centers which hold 'mamm' parties are basically having to induce inebriation in order to convince many women to get mammograms, shows how slyly coercive the cancer industry is becoming in its quest to recruit new cancer patients. With thousands of women waking up to the fact that mammograms are much more dangerous than we are all being told, and a cause of cancer in and of themselves, it is hardly surprising that the cancer industry has sunk to unconscionable new lows. And yet at the very same time, getting women drunk in order to compress their breasts for a radiation screening is technically a form of rape, or at the very least, molestation with alcohol and ambiance representing the date rape drugs of choice. Even worse is the fact that many insurance companies are now covering the costs associated with holding mamm parties, which include not only food and beverage costs, but also all the massages and other luxurious spa resort amenities that increasingly characterize many of the gatherings. Whatever it takes to get women to subject themselves to radiation blasts is fair game, in other words, and it appears as though the specious strategy is quite a success. 'I am having fun,' explained one woman attending a recent mamm party in Nevada to KTVN Channel 2 News in Reno. 'Way better than the last time I came here and had [a mammogram]. This time it didn't hurt. Maybe it was the glass of wine I had before I went.' "
0," Frankincense and myrrh have long been touted for their healing abilities and protective powers. For example, both have ties to Christianity, where they were gifts brought to Bethlehem by the Wise Men. They were also used across a variety of cultures in ancient times; in Egypt, frankincense was used as an eyeliner, thought to not only enhance beauty but bring about vision-protecting abilities. Greek physician Hippocrates wrote extensively about myrrh, and both frankincense and myrrh were heavily traded for thousands of years. (1) Today, the benefits of both continue to prove effective, including the ability to heal certain cancers. Frankincense as a cancer fighter In fact, researchers from Leicester University say the gum resin frankincense contains a chemical compound that has the potential to kill cancer cells and that it may be a viable treatment of cancers such as breast, prostate, ovarian and colon. The particular compound is acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) and was studied at length by university experts and has been said to have the ability to fight off ovarian cancer cells even as they are in the last stage. (2) 'After a year of studying the AKBA compound with ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro, we have been able to show it is effective at killing the cancer cells,' said Kamla Al-Salmani, a PhD student from the University's Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine. 'Frankincense is taken by many people with no known side-effects.' Even more promising is their finding that the Frankincense compound is effective even among cancer cells that have been resistant to chemotherapy, something which Dr. Mark Evans, Kamla's PhD Supervisor and University lecturer, says 'may indeed be able to help overcome drug resistance, and lead to an improved survival rate for patients with late-stage ovarian cancer.' (2) Myrhh, frankincense and other combinations can help with healing Myrrh, too, has been found to be effective for improving health. Used as an essential oil, it's been shown to have the ability to heal skin conditions such as athlete's foot and eczema, aid in wound healing, strengthen gums and ease respiratory problems. (3,4) More notably, a study published in the Journal of Food Safety, Nutrition and Public Health found that myrrh had cholesterol-reducing abilities. (5) A combination of frankincense and myrrh is also helpful for health; the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy suggests that along with cardamom and cinnamon, the two can stave off stomach aches, fight bad breath, loosen phlegm and provide toothache relief. (5) Another combination involves that of myrrh and turmeric, which was discovered to have a protective, cell-detoxifying effect that reduced lead toxicity. That particular study was published in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology and conducted by researchers at Alexandria University Research Development in Egypt. (6) While the benefits of frankincense and myrrh are plenty, it should be noted that their oils (all essential oils) are potent, and as such, careful consideration to diluting for ingestion and applying topically should be given. Ideally, only therapeutic-grade essential oils should be used, and discussion with a naturopath prior to use can help ensure utmost safety. Using such oils in a diffuser is a common way to reap the benefits of such oils safely.

0," Gabriel Cousins offers some interesting information about the sunlight that's available and accessible from uncooked foods from nature. He tells us that there is light energy - literally energy from the sun - in uncooked foods from nature. He also tells us that when foods are cooked, this light energy dissipates or leaves the foods. It's an argument that when you eat uncooked natural foods, you are literally putting the sun's powerful energy into your body. And when you apply a spiritual layer over this, it's easy to see why folks eating lots of uncooked foods from nature tend to develop higher consciousnesses. With their diets these people are letting light into their bodies and quite simply, by putting light in the body is how people tend to become enlightened . This is in opposition to eating diets of mostly cooked foods, which as seen from this perspective would be dark, or having no light. Regularly eating animals and chemicals is also putting darkness into your body, and eating fearful animals is a good way to make yourself fearful. It's not commonly known, but this energy does transfer. And since psychologists tell us that there are only two basic human emotions, love and fear, with this, we start to see how we create our own emotional, and therefore energetic states, by what we put in our bodies. How Much Does Our Food Have to Do with Our Current World Situation? The light and dark energy component is also why the people who seem hell-bent on destroying the planet and people these days so often use poisons to do so, and so consistently poison our foods . It's the easiest way they can come up with to get the population to comply with the ways of the dark because these things literally make us dark. When you apply a 'where we are in humanity' layer on top of all this - and a lot of people would agree that the world climate is currently fairly dark - one has to ask: Could a dark world climate be caused by the majority of the population regularly and almost exclusively eating dark foods? If it is, is the solution just as easy? Doing deep detoxification is a powerful method to remove the stored darkness. Then, when you begin avoiding the dark foods and chemicals, and start adding to your body lots of foods that hold light, enlightenment becomes an option and an extremely viable one. Then you have to ask yourself, would we really have all of these world problems with a population of enlightened people? The answer is no. Is it odd that in a culture that struggles so much, so few have noticed that all of the individuals who have become known for their enlightenment, have been into deep detoxification? Of course, they've mostly become religious figures and it's not what the church teaches, but if you look at their lives, they all became enlightened, or ended their suffering through the same path - physically removing their internally stored darkness, often through fasting. Green leafy vegetables are known to hold the most light energy. "
0," Tweet Using unusually rigorous scientific conditions and measures, Johns Hopkins researchers have shown that the active agent in sacred mushrooms can induce mystical/spiritual experiences descriptively identical to spontaneous ones people have reported for centuries. The resulting experiences apparently prompt positive changes in behavior and attitude that last several months, at least. The agent, a plant alkaloid called psilocybin, mimics the effect of serotonin on brain receptors-as do some other hallucinogens-but precisely where in the brain and in what manner are unknown. An account of the study, accompanied by an editorial and four experts commentaries, appears online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. Cited as landmark in the commentary by former National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) director, Charles Schuster, the research marks a new systematic approach to studying certain hallucinogenic compounds that, in the 1950s, showed signs of therapeutic potential or value in research into the nature of consciousness and sensory perception. Human consciousnessis a function of the ebb and flow of neural impulses in various regions of the brain-the very substrate that drugs such as psilocybin act upon, Schuster says. Understanding what mediates these effects is clearly within the realm of neuroscience and deserves investigation. A vast gap exists between what we know of these drugs-mostly from descriptive anthropology-and what we believe we can understand using modern clinical pharmacology techniques, says study leader Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., a professor with Hopkins departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry and Behavioral Biology. That gap is large because, as a reaction to the excesses of the 1960s, human research with hallucinogens has been basically frozen in time these last forty years. All of the studys authors caution about substantial risks of taking psilocybin under conditions not appropriately supervised. Even in this study, where we greatly controlled conditions to minimize adverse effects, about a third of subjects reported significant fear, with some also reporting transient feelings of paranoia, says Griffiths. Under unmonitored conditions, its not hard to imagine those emotions escalating to panic and dangerous behavior. The researchers message isnt just that psilocybin can produce mystical experiences. I had a healthy skepticism going into this, says Griffiths, and that finding alone was a surprise. But, as important, he says, is that, under very defined conditions, with careful preparation, you can safely and fairly reliably occasion whats called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person. Its an early step in what we hope will be a large body of scientific work that will ultimately help people. The authors acknowledge the unusual nature of the work, treading, as it does, a fine line between neuroscience and areas most would consider outside sciences realm. But establishing the basic science here is necessary, says Griffiths, to take advantage of the possible benefits psilocybin can bring to our understanding of how thought, emotion, and ultimately behavior are grounded in biology. Griffiths is quick to emphasize the scientific intent of the study. Were just measuring what can be observed, he says; Were not entering into Does God exist or not exist. This work cant and wont go there. In the study, more than 60 percent of subjects described the effects of psilocybin in ways that met criteria for a full mystical experience as measured by established psychological scales. One third said the experience was the single most spiritually significant of their lifetimes; and more than two-thirds rated it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant. Griffiths says subjects liken it to the importance of the birth of their first child or the death of a parent. Two months later, 79 percent of subjects reported moderately or greatly increased well-being or life satisfaction compared with those given a placebo at the same test session. A majority said their mood, attitudes and behaviors had changed for the better. Structured interviews with family members, friends and co-workers generally confirmed the subjects remarks. Results of a year-long followup are being readied for publication. Psychological tests and subjects own reports showed no harm to study participants, though some admitted extreme anxiety or other unpleasant effects in the hours following the psilocybin capsule. The drug has not been observed to be addictive or physically toxic in animal studies or human populations. In this regard, says Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist, it contrasts with MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines or alcohol. The study isnt the first with psilocybin, the researchers say, though some of the earlier ones, done elsewhere, had notably less rigorous design, were less thorough in measuring outcomes or lacked longer-term follow-up. In the present work, 36 healthy, well-educated volunteers-most of them middle-aged-with no family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder were selected. All had active spiritual practices. We thought a familiarity with spiritual practice would give them a framework for interpreting their experiences and that theyd be less likely to be confused or troubled by them, Griffiths says. All gave informed consent to the study approved by Hopkins institutional review board. Each of thirty of the subjects attended two separate 8-hour drug sessions, at two month intervals. On one they received psilocybin, on another, methylphenidate (Ritalin), the active placebo. In designing the study, researchers had to overcome or at least, greatly minimize two hurdles: the risk of adverse side-effects and the likelihood that the expectations of getting the test drug or the placebo would influence subjects perceptions. To lessen the former, each subject met several times, before drug sessions began, with a reassuring monitor, a medical professional experienced in observing drug study participants. Monitors stayed with them during the capsule-taking sessions. Actual trials took place in a room outfitted like a comfortable, slightly upscale living room, with soft music and indirect, non-laboratory lighting. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured throughout. The researchers countered expectancy by having both monitors and subjects blinded to what substance would be given. For ethical reasons, subjects were told about hallucinogens possible effects, butalso learned they could, instead, get other substances-weak or strong-that might change perception or consciousness. Most important, a third red herring group of six subjects had two blinded placebo sessions, then were told theyd receive psilocybin at a third. This tactic-questionnaires later verified-kept participants and monitors in the dark at the first two sessions about each capsules contents. Nine established questionnaires and a new, specially createdfollowup survey were used to rate experiences at appropriate times in the study. They included those that differentiate effects of psychoactive drugs, that detect altered states of consciousness, that rate mystical experiences and assess changes in outlook. The study, Griffiths adds, has advanced understanding of hallucinogen abuse. As for where the work could lead, the team is planning a trial of patients suffering from advanced cancer-related depression or anxiety, following up suggestive research several decades ago. Theyre also designing studies to test a role for psilocybin in treating drug dependence. The study was funded by grants from NIDA and the Council on Spiritual Practices. Una McCann, M.D., William Richards, Ph.D., of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Robert Jesse of the Council on Spiritual Practices, San Francisco, were co-researchers. "
0," A Michigan woman who says she was wrongfully dismissed from nursing school at Baker College in Flint for raising concerns about the institution's unethical -- and for all intents and purposes, illegal -- vaccine bullying curriculum has filed a lawsuit in circuit court against the private establishment. Nichole Rolfe, who was getting close to graduating from her program before being ousted, claims that she became a target of several of her teachers after questioning the methods by which they were instructing her and her fellow students to coerce parents into vaccinating their children, in violation of the American Nursing Association's Code of Ethics. According to Rolfe's official legal filing, which is available here , [PDF] problems arose when some of her instructors began dispensing unethical advice on how to deceive parents into getting their children vaccinated. Rolfe says that she and her classmates were advised to push the Tdap vaccine for pertussis (whooping cough) on parents walking into the labor and delivery floor, even though the vaccine admittedly doesn't confer antibodies for up to six months, and possibly not at all. When she questioned the rationale behind this, she was immediately silenced. 'I asked how they could promote this when they were giving these families a false sense of security,' recalled Rolfe on a posting to the VacTruth Facebook page back in 2013, in which she petitioned for help from the health freedom community. 'The instructor ended the conversation.' Rolfe told by Baker College instructors to LIE about vaccine safety and to threaten parents Rolfe says she and her fellow nursing students were also instructed to push vaccines on sick children, even though doing so is both contraindicated (not advised) and in violation of informed consent protocols. Rolfe was also told to lie to parents about vaccine safety, to which she also vocalized objection. A couple of weeks later, Rolfe was dismissed from the program on the false grounds that she had 'harassed' her instructors, even though she was merely asking critically thought-out questions about the ethicality and legality of what she was being taught. Rolfe was also one of the top students in her program, having earned solid marks. Specifically named in the suit are Connie Smith, the Assistant Director of Nursing at Baker College, and Alysia Osoff, the pediatrics instructor who allegedly told Rolfe and other nursing students to push vaccines on ill children and lie to parents in order to coerce them into getting Tdap vaccines. In other words, Osoff's advice was legally, morally and ethically wrong. 'Obtaining uninformed or false consent for a medical procedure under false pretenses is assault and battery under both criminal and civil law,' notes Rolfe in her complaint. 'Obtaining uninformed or false consent for a medical procedure under false pretenses is a violation of the American Nursing Association Code of Ethics for nurses. Obtaining uninformed or false consent for a medical procedure under false pretenses is contrary to the practice of family center care and gaining and securing the trust of patients.' Nursing students today are being brainwashed into medical fascism propaganda, and dissenters are being punished The fact that Rolfe actually questioned these and other blatant violations of the Hippocratic Oath to 'do no harm' sets her apart from the rest of her fellow students, and actually makes her more qualified to be a nurse. And yet for trying to abide by proper protocol, Rolfe was wrongfully let go from her school, for which she is now seeking damages.

0," Sure, vaccines are safe -- except when they randomly trigger extreme brain inflammation that leads to vision loss, paralysis and an inability to speak. This is what happened to now-10-year-old Marysue Grivna of Tampa, Florida, just four days after she received a flu vaccine, which left her completely debilitated with a serious brain disease known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM. It all began on November 22, 2013, when young Marysue was taken in to get a seasonal flu vaccine. Just days later, the child began to get sick and quickly developed symptoms of paralysis. Worried, her parents took her in for an evaluation and it was determined that she had succumbed to an immune disorder caused by inflammation of the brain. Similar to multiple sclerosis, ADEM manifests as an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks itself, in this case targeting the protective coverings surrounding nerve fibers. Known as myelin, these coverings are meant to protect nerves in the brain and spinal cord, for instance, from being harmed. In their absence, symptoms like loss of vision and paralysis can occur. 'Her father Steven and I are certain, due to all our research, that this was what caused Marysue's condition,' stated the girl's mother, Carla, during a recent interview with Fox & Friends . 'The doctors won't confirm it or deny it... [but] she was a happy, healthy, running, and playing nine-year-old. Then this happened.' 5 percent of ADEM cases emerge after vaccination, says NIH Though the doctors involved were reluctant to admit that the flu shot was the cause, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) admits that as many as 5 percent of ADEM cases emerge immediately following vaccination. The disease can also emerge following certain surgical procedures, says Dr. Juan Dumois, director of All Children's Hospital, where Marysue was admitted. 'It can just appear out of the blue or after maybe a surgical procedure,' he told CBS 10 News . A similar case occurred in 2008 when a 75-year-old woman developed ADEM just two days after getting a flu shot. According to the Daily Mail , the woman began to suffer symptoms of numbness and paralysis, and later died -- all from a vaccine that as we reported back in 2011 is almost completely ineffective at preventing the flu. 'Marysue is now nonverbal, confined to a wheelchair/hospital bed, is primarily eating via a g-tube though we are now able to start feeding her stage two baby food by mouth,' says the family on a GoFundMe page seeking financial assistance for the construction of a new room that will accommodate Marysue's special needs. 'Our house is very small and her hospital bed is in our living room because the doors in our house are too narrow to accommodate her bed or wheelchair,' they say. 'We are also trying to raise funds to purchase a wheelchair van. If we had this, we feel we could possibly get one of our neighbors to put her in her wheelchair... thus providing me and her grandmother the ability to take her [to the doctor] and relieving her father having to carry her.' The Grivna family's GoFundMe page, which contains further details of the girl's demise following her flu shot, can be accessed here: GoFundMe.com .

0," One by one, traditionally left-wing and liberal institutions are turning on President Obama, who is perhaps the most liberal president in U.S. history, following disclosure of a series of horrific abuses of power that have taken place during his tenure. In early June an editorial from no less than The New York Times bashed the president over the National Security Agency 's wholesale capture of metadata on millions of Verizon customers (and, really, on every American , we now know), declaring that the president who once promised his administration would be the most transparent ever had 'lost all credibility' on the issue of privacy protection. Now, the American Civil Liberties Union has lashed out at the president over the same issue - his administration's massive, serial violations of the Fourth Amendment - calling the abuse much more than just a 'modest encroachment' on privacy. 'Metadata is back in the news, following The Guardian 's extraordinary revelation on Wednesday revealing that the National Security Agency has been secretly scooping up the phone records of millions of Americans,' writes Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. 'But intelligence officials - echoed by President Obama today, who characterized access to metadata a 'modest encroachment' on privacy - are implying that the information they're collecting is relatively innocuous, since they don't listen in on the actual phone conversations.' Metadata is key Going further, Stanley notes why this massive theft of metadata on Americans is a big deal. In an op-ed piece for Reuters , Stanley - along with colleague Ben Wizner - point to evidence that metadata is key to revealing anything and everything about a person, including their sexual orientation, and the implications that kind of information could have when it winds up in the hands of an all-powerful entity like the federal government's spy network: A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study a few years back found that reviewing people's social networking contacts alone was sufficient to determine their sexual orientation. Consider, metadata from email communications was sufficient to identify the mistress of then-CIA Director David Petraeus and then drive him out of office. Petraeus went from hero of Iraq and Afghanistan to director of the world's most powerful foreign spy service - to an asterisk in the dustbin of U.S. military and intelligence history. So when Obama and his congressional surrogates from both parties try to tell you that, hey, all of this spying is no big deal because they aren't listening to the content of phone calls , Stanley and Wizner say that's irrelevant, considering what metadata can tell already tell the government about you and your activities (which makes sense as to why the NSA is capturing it): The 'who,' 'when' and 'how frequently' of communications are often more revealing than what is said or written. Calls between a reporter and a government whistleblower, for example, may reveal a relationship that can be incriminating all on its own. Boy, does that sound familiar . What about metadata indicating repeated calls to, say, hotlines for gay teenagers? Alcoholics Anonymous? An abortion clinic? A gambling bookie? Your doctor's office or pharmacy? A mental health clinic? Serious constitutional crisis 'If a politician were revealed to have repeatedly called a phone sex hotline after 2:00 a.m., no one would need to know what was said on the call before drawing conclusions,' write Stanley and Wizner. 'In addition sophisticated data-mining technologies have compounded the privacy implications by allowing the government to analyze terabytes of metadata and reveal far more details about a person's life than ever before.' These are all legal but intensely private activities that the government has no business knowing about. They have nothing to do with the prevention of terrorist attacks . They are all actions that are protected by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments , at a minimum. And yet, you have a president and members of Congress trying to tell you that the NSA has every right to do this, and that the NSA employee, Edward Snowden, who blew the whistle on these constitutional abuses, is the real traitor . That a traditionally 'progressive' liberal organization like the ACLU would put aside its usual partisan tone to call out this president and his administration for what it has done should be a good indicator to you that this is a serious constitutional crisis.

0," It recently went public that the Obama administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), shut down a proposal that would have protected pregnant women and young children from mercury poisoning when going to the dentist. Top officials within the regime reportedly shut down a proposal by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that would have instructed oral health doctors to stop using mercury fillings to treat cavities in pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under age six, and anyone with kidney disease, neurological problems, and/or a sensitivity to mercury exposure. The proposal came about after several dental patients speaking at a town hall meeting in San Francisco back in 2011 explained how severe health problems from which they were suffering disappeared after they had their mercury amalgam fillings removed. The FDA responded by coming up with a plan that Center for Devices and Radiological Health Jeffrey Shuren stated, at the time, would result in policy changes within the next year. But the FDA's proposal was quietly trashed by HHS, which refuses to acknowledge the dangers of amalgam fillings. 'Mercury is one of the most poisonous substances known to mankind,' stated holistic physician Dr. David Brownstein, M.D., to Newsmax Health . 'It is a potent neurotoxin and is associated with numerous neurological and immune system problems.' 'The only reason the government stopped the proposal is because of money. It's cheaper to put mercury fillings in someone's mouth than non-mercury fillings.' Read about other toxins to be wary of at toxins.news Obama opposes mercury in coal plant pollution, but sees nothing wrong with mercury in fillings and vaccines Because resin composite fillings tend to cost more than mercury-based fillings -- Dr. Brownstein says composites cost about $100 more per tooth -- the government may just be looking out for its bottom line. After all, eliminating amalgam fillings as an option would result in major cost increases for Medicare and Medicaid. But the Obama regime remains outspoken about the dangers of mercury from other sources, including coal power plants that produce mercury during combustion. Why, then, does it remain silent about mercury in people's mouths, or in childhood vaccines? 'President Obama wants to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants because they emit mercury ,' says Dr. Brownstein. 'But then he says it's okay to have mercury installed in our mouths.' 'But the two most common sources of mercury in the human body come from dental fillings containing mercury, and vaccines, and the government allows both of them. The government's priorities are totally misguided. There's no excuse that mercury fillings are still allowed to be used.' Flu vaccines, by the way, contain as much as 25,000 times the maximum legal limit of mercury for drinking water, as we uncovered here at the selfnews Forensic Food lab last year. And yet there hasn't been a peep from the Obama administration about developing safe flu shots that don't pose a mercury risk to young children and pregnant mothers. As for the coal-fired power plants, the Supreme Court on June 29 blocked the Obama administration's efforts to regulate mercury emissions. The court ruled, following challenges from some 20 U.S. states, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to take into account how the restrictions would 'punish' producers and consumers of energy with higher costs. 'It is not rational, never mind 'appropriate,' to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits,' wrote Justice Antonin Scalia.

0," Millions of people around the world have embraced a recently released encyclical by Pope Francis that focuses a great deal of attention on so-called climate change, capitalism and other forms of political, economic, and environmental policy. Most of what the pope wrote was readily accepted by a great number of people, while others criticized it for its seeming acceptance of environmental science that has yet to actually be settled and economic models that have brought prosperity to a greater portion of the planet than at any time in its history. In recent days, however, the pontiff said something that has roiled a large segment of American society and left many U.S. Catholics wondering whether the Holy See really represents them anymore. As reported by a news site called the Sleuth Journal and Reuters, Pope Francis observed that weapons makers could never call themselves Christians in comments to young people at a large rally in the Italian city of Turin. Are they even Christians? 'If you trust only men you have lost,' he told the crowd in a long, often rambling talk about war, trust and politics, after ditching aside his prepared remarks. 'It makes me think of ... people, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons. That leads to a bit a[ sic ] distrust, doesn't it?' he said to applause. He also criticized those who invest in weapons industries, saying 'duplicity is the currency of today ... they say one thing and do another,' Reuters noted. So, what does the pontiff who is always guarded by a company of armed bodyguards and Vatican City security personnel say about the American right to keep and own firearms, as recognized by the Second Amendment? Not much that is good or positive. A year ago, the pontiff warned that human traffickers, slave traders and weapons makers would have to answer to God on their Judgment Day. He was particularly harsh toward weapons makers and dealers, alleging they are not interested in the word of God because they 'fabricate death, they are merchants of death and make death into a trade.' His new criticism in Turin now suggests that gun dealers, gun makers and, by extension, gun owners, are not even Christian, noted Natasha Noman at PolicyMic . Perhaps Americans should not be surprised given that the Catholic Church embraces the Ten Commandments, one of which is 'Thou shalt not kill.' Fewer guns in private hands until they are no longer allowed In practical terms, however, the Vatican has regularly opposed private firearm ownership. In 2011, the National Catholic Reporter noted that though there are few overt statements from the Church regarding private firearms ownership, the reality is that the Vatican is quite clear on that position: The Catholic Church's position on gun control is not easy to find; there are dozens of speeches and talks and a few documents that call for much tighter regulation of the global arms trade, but what about private gun ownership? The answer is resoundingly clear: Firearms in the hands of civilians should be strictly limited and eventually completely eliminated. That won't be clear, judging by the dearth of public statements and headlines detailing the Church's position, which derives a great deal of funding from American Catholics, many of whom are constitutional conservatives. In fact, the NCR noted that the Church's position is cloaked in a footnote in a document on crime by the U.S. Bishops' conference while being mentioned in dozens of official Vatican texts on the global trade of arms. The most direct statement, NCR reports, comes in the bishops' 'Responsibility, Rehabilitation and Restoration: A Catholic Perspective on Crime and Criminal Justice,' published in November 2000. 'As bishops, we support measures that control the sale and use of firearms and make them safer -- especially efforts that prevent their unsupervised use by children or anyone other than the owner -- and we reiterate our call for sensible regulation of handguns,' it says, as reported by NCR.

0," With a massive backlash now mounting against Robert De Niro for censoring an independent film on vaccines, the Tribeca Film Festival has been subjected to intense scrutiny across independent media as journalists seek to discover who got to De Niro and what did they threaten him with? After being threatened by vaccine industry totalitarians and science bullies, De Niro blackballed the VAXXED documentary from the Tribeca Film Festival, playing right into the hands of state-run medical propagandists who are all pro-vaccine. This betrayal of a powerful, historic indy film has not gone unnoticed by the people of America. In effect, Robert De Niro has become a traitor to his own film industry that was founded on freedom of expression . He has just announced to the world that any film which dares challenge the official narratives of criminal vaccine corporations will be blackballed at Tribeca and not allowed to see the light of day. But far beyond that, we've now learned that the Tribeca Film Festival has a strategic partnership with the Nazi-linked Sloan Foundation , founded by Alfred P. Sloan, a Nazi collaborator and hater of blacks and Jews. Sloan, much like Bill Gates, was a globalist eugenics promoter who believed in eliminating the 'undesirable' people from the planet, leaving only a superior race in charge. A Zen Gardner article also reveals how the Sloan Foundation held corporate stock in the Merck corporation , the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines: Industrialist Alfred P. Sloan, as head of General Motors, was a Nazi collaborator, and ardent admirer of Hitler. Sloans hatred of blacks was almost as intense as his hatred of Jews. He had a close connection with the eugenics movement which eventually became the Human Genome Project. The Sloan Foundation, together with the Rockefeller nexus, held a long standing interest in population reduction, including their involvement with the introduction of mysterious new vaccines together with the World Health Organization, which has a stated policy of population reduction, as clearly set forth in Agenda 21. (truthaboutagenda21.com). This dubious enterprise led to a massive vaccine initiative to vaccinate against relatively rare tetanus in The Philippines, Nicaragua, and Mexico. These vaccine vials, distributed by the WHO, were found to contain hCG, which when combined with tetanus toxoid carrier, stimulated formation of antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin, rendering women incapable of maintaining a pregnancy and potentially inducing a covert, involuntary abortion. Population control under the cover of health care. (ethiofreedom.com). This seemingly altruistic Sloan Foundation also funded the Community Blood Council of Greater New York, Inc., which allowed more than 10,000 hemophiliacs and countless others to become fatally infected with HIV/Aids. Moreover, The Sloan Foundation held 24,000-53,000 shares issued by Merck and Co., whose president George W. Merck was director of Americas biological weapons industry and whose Hepatitis C and polio vaccines have been suspected of transmitting AIDs; and who knows what else. (Population Control: Aids/Ebola and other man-made diseases, S.R. Shearer, July 29, 2014). Dr. Leonard Horowitzs seminal work, Aids and Ebola: Nature, Accident or Intentional, contends that both Ebola and Aids were bio-engineered by scientists working for the CIA. The Sloan Foundation is currently headed by Paul Joskow, a member of the global elite who's also a key leader of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations), the same group that includes all the corrupt banksters from Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve. In all, globalists like Joskow and Bill Gates seek to rid the planet of excess human population , and vaccines are the key element for accomplishing this task, which is exactly why covert sterilization chemicals are being routinely hidden in vaccine test runs deployed in Africa , furthering the goal of genocide against blacks (and it's all WHO-approved, too). RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Living in the Age of Transparency We are all living in a transition time, moving out of the Age of Secrecy for humanity, and into the Age of Transparency where all the dirty secrets of the globalists, the vaccine corporations and the false front group non-profits are eventually exposed. Nearly all the large disease non-profits (cancer, diabetes, etc.) are actually front groups for Big Pharma. Nearly all the vaccine research being conducted today is scientifically fraudulent. AIDS vaccines, for example, were promised to humanity in the 1980s, yet decades later, they still don't exist and don't work. Prominent AIDS vaccine researchers have been found to be criminals committing outright scientific fraud and fabrications. From selfnews : A scientist from Iowa State University who admitted to lying about the efficacy of a vaccine he helped develop for the AIDS virus has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison, according to new reports. Dong-Pyou Han, 58, recently confessed to altering blood samples to make it seem as though he'd made a huge discovery on the AIDS front, only to be later outed for flagrant scientific fraud. Besides his prison term, Han will also be forced to pay $7.2 million in fines to the federal government after entering a plea agreement back in February, in which he admitted to two counts of making false statements. As we reported back in February, two former Merck scientists who filed a False Claims Act against the company back in 2010 had came forward with evidence showing that Merck tampered with study data and ultimately lied about the safety of the MMR vaccine. Like Han and his colleagues, Merck scientists tampered with blood samples in order to artificially induce a fake antibody response, all in order to create the illusion that MMR is safe and effective. Robert De Niro following in the footsteps of Joseph Goebbels Today, just as Americans are waking up to the shocking fact that the vaccine industry has been systematically poisoning their children for decades while committing scientific fraud to hide the evidence of harm, Robert De Niro has followed in the footsteps of Joseph Goebbels as the Tribeca Propaganda Minister of Truth , silencing independent filmmakers who have extraordinary contributions to offer the world. This silencing of filmmakers is entirely consistent with the Nazi regime's book burning agenda to destroy knowledge they didn't want citizens to access. It is this destruction of knowledge and oppression of independent science that now infects the vaccine industry, an industry steeped in fraud, criminality and medical violence against children. Similarly, while the Nazi Holocaust murdered six million Jews in the name of cleansing the population, today's vaccine medical holocaust murders and maims children in the name of cleansing public health. The justifications are identical, too: Nazis justified the killing of Jews as a way to achieve the 'greater good' of a superior society. Today's vaccine pushers invoke precisely the same logic, saying that even if a few children die from vaccines, that's acceptable 'for the greater good' of society. The reflection of Nazi philosophy is not a coincidence; it is an extension of the origins of Big Pharma and IG Farben, the Nazi chemical conglomerate that was found guilty of crimes against humanity and forced to break apart into three corporations after the conclusion of World War II. IG Farben has been called the Monsanto of World War II , and routinely carried out medical experiments on human prisoners. Zyklon-B, by the way, the deadly gas used on Jewish prisoners, was a pesticide . Today, its derivatives are sprayed on the food supply so that no one dies right away. Instead of killing people outright, today's globalist corporations have figured out how to profit from their sickness and chronic disease by keeping them trapped in a never-ending cycle of sickness and pharmaceutical treatment. One of the corporations coming out of the IG Farben break up was Bayer, the drug company. Bayer's chairperson (Fritz ter Meer) actually served time in prison for committing crimes against humanity . From selfnews : I.G. Farben was a powerful cartel comprised of Bayer, BASF, Hoechst, and other German chemical companies which experimented mercilessly on Jewish prisoners as Hitler commanded, inside the World War II Auschwitz Concentration Camp, testing dangerous drugs and vaccines and killing thousands. In fact, Auschwitz was the largest mass extermination factory in human history. A few years later, the Nuremberg War Criminal Tribunal convicted 24 of the I.G. Farben executives for mass murder, slavery and other crimes against humanity; however, in less than 7 years, every single murderer was released, and began consulting American corporations. From 1950 to 1980, Bayer, BASF, and Hoechst filled their highest position, Chairman of the Board, with convicted mass murderers. Fritz ter Meer, convicted of mass murder, served just 5 prison years, then 'conveniently' became the chairman of Bayer's supervisory board. Carl Wurster of BASF helped manufacture Zyklon-B gas, the powerful pesticide used to execute millions of Jews. He knew the use of this product was for annihilation, and his partners in crime were convicted and hanged in 1946. Arthur Rudolph, director of the concentration camp where 20,000 Jewish and Polish workers died from beatings, hangings and starvation, was granted U.S. citizenship and went on to design the Saturn 5 rocket used in the Apollo moon landings. Kurt Blome, who admitted to killing Jews with 'gruesome experiments,' was hired in 1951 by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps to work on chemical warfare. Nazi pharma companies, the Sloan Foundation and the Tribeca Film Festival All this history of murder and criminality now comes full circle via Alfred P. Sloan, the Sloan Foundation's partnership with the Tribeca Film Festival, and Robert De Niro's censorship of the VAXXED documentary. It's all the same history repeating itself over and over: Slaughter innocent humans in the name of 'science.' Use technology to poison the people. Suppress, threaten or murder any who dare speak out against you, and use the power of the state to control the media and push the propaganda that furthers your depopulation (eugenics) agenda. This is exactly why drug companies like Pfizer use Nigerian children as medical guinea pigs for their vaccine experiments . If you thought the Tribeca Film Festival news was only about censorship, that only scratched the surface. As you're now learning, this is a far more insidious issue that can be traced back to the most evil empire of death and destruction that has ever existed on our planet. That empire, the Third Reich, is still operating today in America. In fact, journalist Jim Marrs has documented the continuation of Nazi eugenics throughout the U.S. medical industry in his aptly-named book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies That Threaten to Take Over America . If you dare to read that book, your mind will practically explode with all the documented evidence that proves Nazi eugenicists are right now working inside America's institutions of medicine, technology and government. They are key influencers like we've seen with the Sloan Foundation, and they shape the media, public policy, non-profits, academic institutions and the highest decision makers in medicine and public health. Their goal is brutally simple: Rid the world of what they see as inferior humans , which they see as being Third World citizens, blacks, Jews and Latinos. This is exactly why vaccine trials in places like Mexico end up killing or hospitalizing 75% of those who were vaccinated . Similarly, tetanus vaccines given to women in Africa have been scientifically found to contain sterilization chemicals for depopulation . The World Health Organization is deeply involved in the use of Africans for vaccine experiments and covert sterilization experiments -- all the vaccines found to contain sterilization chemicals have been WHO-approved . Bill Gates, a key propagandist and funding source for depopulation experiments, once declared that 'democracy is a problem' and that totalitarian science should dominate society. He has funded the development of microchip-based sterilization of women and famously declared that vaccines can help REDUCE world population . As Gates states in this video : The world today has 6.8 billion people... that's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. Vaccines are deployed for depopulation experiments while training the sheeple to surrender to medical totalitarianism Vaccines are the perfect vector for depopulation because the public can be convinced to take the vaccines through repeated media propaganda messaging , which is the whole point of the NY Times, Washington Post, USA Today, etc., incessantly pushing a pro-vaccine message while censoring all news of CDC whistleblowers, vaccine damage awards, vaccine side effects and vaccine industry fraud. Those citizens who refuse to buy the propaganda can be forced to take vaccines through state coercion policies like California's SB 277, a forced vaccination law modeled after Nazi medical tyranny that mandated the sterilization of retarded people and the forced euthanasia of the elderly. (See the complete list of Nazi health propaganda posters, below.) The deeper you go in looking at the vaccine industry and the role of media propaganda, the more you realize this is all a global medical holocaust being carried out against humanity . That doesn't mean all the nurses, doctors and journalists are in on it. They have no idea what they are part of. As with all such agendas, compartmentalization is key to keeping the low-level grunts of the operation totally unaware of what they're carrying out. Most doctors, nurses, pharmacists and scientists totally believe that vaccines are 100% safe and 100% effective. They have no idea that they're part of a global eugenics / depopulation machine that uses vaccines to accomplish a goal originally inspired by the Nazi regime. No doubt Robert De Niro has no clue what he's involved in, either. He's just a guy trying to run a film festival. Little did he know that he's already in bed with Nazi collaborators who have a far more sinister agenda in mind. Nazi health propaganda posters mirror today's vaccine propaganda With each passing day as vaccine fanaticism spreads like a virus of the mind across the mainstream media, America is marching down the path of genocide and heinous human rights violations in the name of 'SCIENCE!' The very arguments used by today's vaccine pushers to claim that the government should force everyone to be vaccinated against their will closely resemble the eugenics justifications of Nazi Germany . The collection of Nazi propaganda posters you see below has been translated by selfnews in order to show the parallels between Nazi crimes against humanity and today's fanatical vaccine mandate schemes that are based on very similar moral justification and distorted logic. Nazi propaganda poster: The Ideal Man Along with policies of forced euthanasia, sterilization, organ harvesting and medical experimentation, the 'science' Nazi regime attempted to use positive imagery to claim it was creating a better society. The following Nazi poster shows the 'ideal man and woman' as desired by the state: In Pennsylvania, a similar poster promotes vaccines with an attempt at patriotism, saying you 'Earn your stripe!' when you get vaccinated: German poster advocating the forced euthanasia of the physically handicapped This propaganda poster explains that diseased and physically handicapped people are a financial burden on the state. Therefore, the thinking goes, they should all be euthanized for the 'greater good.' This is the same 'greater good' logic now invoked by vaccine pushers in America who believe it is morally justified to harm and kill some children with vaccines because the policy serves the interests of the state: A congenitally diseased or handicapped person costs the government 5.5 Reichsmark daily. For 5.5 Reichsmark a healthy, sound family can live a full day of life. This flu shot poster in the United States argues that flu shots 'save lives,' glossing over the reality that flu shots still contain mercury , a potent neurotoxic heavy metal that causes permanent brain damage: Kill the mentally ill negros This Nazi poster complains about the cost of the government providing care for a 'mentally ill negro' who has been institutionalized for 16 years. As with all the other posters shown here, the argument is that killing people like this negro is 'good for society!' It's the same argument used with forced vaccinations, forced organ harvesting and the government's health care 'death panels' in America today. Mentally ill negro (English citizen) 16 years in an institution RM 35,000 in costs CDC commits scientific fraud to bury autism risk affecting African-Americans In the United States, top CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson openly admitted that the CDC committed scientific fraud to bury data linking vaccines to autism in African-American boys. As this truth emerged, the CDC went to extraordinary lengths to censor the story, and the entire mainstream media was ordered by the U.S. government to blackball the confession and avoid any mention of it. To this day, the confession of the CDC whistleblower remains the most heavily censored medical story in U.S. history . Just like in Nazi Germany, America's medical system utterly abandons people of dark skin color, considering them 'not worth saving.' Medicine in America today is not just murder; it's also genocide. As proof of all this, consider the recent EPA collusion in the mass lead poisoning of black children in Flint, Michigan . The EPA was fully aware of this extreme lead contamination but knowingly hid that information from the public while black children suffered and died. Granny is next, too. Here's a real cover for Newsweek, announcing, 'The Case for Killing Granny.' The article argued that the U.S. government needed to save money by killing off the elderly: Moral justification for the mass killing of the physically handicapped This next poster argues for the forced killing of the physically handicapped by announcing how much money such people cost the state in health care expenses. The message informs the people of Germany that their money is being wasted on handicapped citizens, implying that killing off those people creates a better society. This congenitally handicapped person costs the nation, as a whole, 60,000 Reichsmark over a lifetime. People this is your money. Read Neuses Volk ('New People') The monthly newsletter of the racially correct political bureau of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party) This TIME Magazine issue argued that the elderly in America should be murdered by removing their feeding tubes as they lay in their hospital beds: Murdering children in the name of God This next poster invokes God, claiming that even God would not want sick or handicapped people to reproduce. Therefore, the logic goes, it is the 'will of God' that the state murder these 'undesirables.' This is based on the belief that the state owns the people -- the very same idea now being aggressively pushed in America by vaccine fanatics who think the government has the right to force medical interventions on people against their wishes. God cannot intend that the sick and infirmed propagate or reproduce sickness and infirmity (physical or mental weakness). Worthless people are multiplying faster! This poster explains how 'worthless people' are multiplying faster than the healthy population. This includes the physically handicapped and mentally ill. The Nazi war on handicapped people mirrors today's mainstream media war against so-called 'anti-vaxxers' who happen to be among the most well-informed people in the world on health issues. In order for any government to imprison or murder large numbers of people, it must first label them as a burden on society: Those worth less are multiplying faster than the healthy population! Number of pregnancies of mothers who had mentally ill children in school for the mentally disabled... ... the average mother in the city [is] concerned Euthanasia candidates This is a picture of children who are candidates for euthanasia. In America today, unvaccinated children are being labeled using the same derogatory language (even though most unvaccinated children are, in reality, far more intelligent and far healthier than vaccinated children). Euthanasia victims vs. vaccine victims In Nazi Germany, victims of birth deformities were frequently slated for euthanasia by the state. In America today, victims of vaccine damage are utterly abandoned by the state , forgotten by the CDC and lying legislators like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Here's an image of Germany's physically handicapped, scheduled for euthanasia: And here are some images of American children damaged by vaccines -- who are then entirely abandoned by doctors, the media and lawmakers: Neurologically damaged by the DPT vaccine: Extreme tissue damage caused by vaccines: The HPV vaccine turned this normal, healthy girl into a brain-damaged victim of vaccines: Another severe skin reaction following vaccination: Hitler orders health authorities to find more people to euthanize the terminally ill Under a medical police state system -- which is precisely what is now being constructed in Oregon, California and many other states across America -- the state can determine when to kill you. The state owns your body, after all, and that precedent was already established when the people refused to resist vaccine mandates. On Sep. 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler ordered Germany's medical doctors to recruit more people who would name people to be euthanized against their will . Included on this list for euthanasia targets were people with cancer, physical handicaps, liver disorders and other health challenges: Letter from Adolf Hitler Berlin Sept. 1, 1939 To the Reichsleiter (leader) Bouhler and Dr. Brandt (a Medical Dr.): They have the responsibility to increase the authority of individuals who will be named to evaluate the terminally ill to determine whether euthanasia can be performed... Forced sterilization of the innocent This Nazi propaganda poster argued that Germany's forced euthanasia and sterilization policies were morally justified because other countries were doing the same thing. In fact, there was 'scientific consensus' at the time that any government could order the murder of handicapped, retarded or chronically ill citizens. Government-sponsored murder was justified under the same 'greater good' logic used by vaccine pushers in America today: We do not stand alone In these countries similar laws exist: USA Denmark Norway Sweden Finland The following countries are considering similar protection: Hungary England Switzerland [illegible] Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases from 7/14/33 Mentally handicapped people are costing you a lot of money, so let's kill them all This poster insists that mentally handicapped people should be killed because they are placing a burden on society. You are sharing the load A person with a hereditary disease costs on average RM 50,000 by the time they reach their 60th birthday. "
0," Analysts and experts have long maintained that the duration of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are having a detrimental effect on the nation's military personnel. Nowhere have the problems of high operational tempos and repeated combat deployments manifested themselves more than in the tens of thousands of soldiers and others who are increasingly being medicated in order to deal with the stress. In fact, according to recent figures released by the Army's surgeon general, more than 110,000 U.S. Army personnel were taking antidepressants, narcotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs that were prescribed to them by doctors. With a renewed focus on individual soldier readiness by the Pentagon after a decade of war, it should trouble Defense Department officials - civilians and top officers alike - that nearly 8 percent of active duty Army troops are on sedatives, and another 6 percent are on antidepressants, figures that are up eightfold since 2005. So many psychotropic drug prescriptions are having an effect on more than just readiness, but also on legal issues affecting military members. 'In a small but growing number of cases across the nation, lawyers are blaming the U.S. military's heavy use of psychotropic drugs for their clients' aberrant behavior and related health problems,' The Los Angeles Times reported in early April. See the selfnews infographic on the psychiatric drugging of soldiers at: http://www.selfnews.com The problem is bad and getting worse Bart Billings, a former military psychologist who hosts an annual conference on combat stress, said the problem is real and it's growing. 'We have never medicated our troops to the extent we are doing now.... And I don't believe the current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a coincidence,' he told the paper. Indeed, the Army suicide rate fell for the first time in four years in 2011, the result of aggressive service-wide efforts to identify those having problems early-on. But the rate is still high. It's about 24 per 100,000 last year, which is higher than a similar demographic among civilians, about 19 per 100,000. Among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, that rate is even higher - about 38 per 100,000. Other problems are increasing too. 'Sexual assault and domestic violence have increased. The percentage of soldiers committing sex crimes has increased 32 percent since 2006,' USA Today reported. 'The number of domestic abusers in the Army grew by almost 50 percent from 4,827 in 2008 to 7,228 last year. During that same, the number of child-abuse offenders is up 62 percent from 3,172 to 5,149.' Too many meds, too little control Clearly, the up-tempo has had a negative effect on our fighting force. But making excuses or explaining away the phenomenon is denial, and it's not going to help the Pentagon and Congress solve the problem. 'It's not that we're using them more frequently or any differently,' said Col. Carol Labadie, the pharmacy consultant for the Army surgeon general. 'As with any medication, you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication.' Experts say the problem isn't necessarily in the numbers. It's that you can't regulate the use of such medications in the military as easily as you can in the civilian world. Follow-up appointments, for example, are few and far between - especially on the battlefield. And soldiers are often sent out into combat zones with six months' worth of medications, enough to trade with their buddies or grab a fistful of pills at the end of a particularly stressful day or mission. Soldiers who have been wounded can easily become addicted to painkillers they are given. 'The big difference is these are people who have access to loaded weapons, or have responsibility for protecting other individuals who are in harm's way,' Grace Jackson, a former Navy staff psychiatrist who resigned her commission in 2002 in part out of concern that military shrinks were handing out too many medications, told the Times. The problem has begun to show up in court, where, increasingly, lawyers for military members on meds have begun to argue - successfully - that the psychotropic drug made them do it. James Culp, a former Army paratrooper who has since become a high-profile military defense lawyer, says he's recently defended an Army private accused of murder. His defense? The soldier's mental condition was exacerbated by the Zoloft he was prescribed. 'What do you do when 30-80 percent of the people that you have in the military have gone on three or more deployments, and they are mentally worn out? What do you do when they can't sleep? You make a calculated risk in prescribing these medications,' Culp told the paper. "
0," A major manufacturer of antibiotic and arsenical chicken feed drugs has voluntarily requested that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdraw approval for some of the combination varieties that the company has stopped manufacturing in recent years. In alleged compliance with the FDA's Judicious Use of Antimicrobials plan for improving the safety of factory animal feed, Phibro Animal Health Corporation decided to pull the drugs in response to escalating scrutiny of their combined effects on animal health and food quality, despite no real formative mandates from the FDA. World Poultry reports that Phibro, of its own volition, recently petitioned the FDA to withdraw approval for both New Animal Drug Application (NADA) 098-371, which includes the use of nicarbazin, penicillin and roxarsone in a three-way, combination drug Type C used in animal feed for broiler chickens, and NADA 098-374, which includes nicarbazin and penicillin in a two-way, combination drug Type C used in similar feeding protocols. Both combination drugs have been approved and on the market for more than 40 years. But the rise of deadly 'superbugs,' or mutated pathogens that no longer respond to standard treatments, has been staggering throughout the past decade, prompting many to call for moratoriums on the use of all antibiotics and arsenicals in animal feed. Dozens of public advocacy groups, including the Alliance for Natural Health USA and the Cornucopia Institute, have pleaded with the FDA to initiate strict bans on such drugs for the safety of the public and the health of factory farm animals. Instead, the FDA decided to issue a non-binding guidance for drug companies to voluntarily withdraw antibiotics and arsenicals from animal feed, a definitive non-move that many prominent media outlets have repeatedly lambasted as useless. But now that the market is dictating that people no longer want to buy meat that contains antibiotics and arsenic, it appears as though some such drugs are being phased out voluntarily, no thanks to the FDA. In fact, Phibro's recent action in requesting that the FDA withdraw approval for its own drugs suggests that even some drug companies might be starting to have more sense than the FDA. Drug companies continue to regulate themselves while FDA plays pretend Or are they? According to a recent contribution posted at the Natural Resources Defense Council's Switchboard blog, Phibro apparently still plans to continue producing penicillin and other drugs for factory animal feed -- the company has simply switched its drug configurations around to make it seem like it is complying with the FDA's spineless guidelines for voluntary removal of antibiotics, which further proves the uselessness of the initiative. 'In addition to the two approvals that Phibro just withdrew for penicillin combined with non-antibiotic drugs in feed, the company also has another feed approval for penicillin used by itself for growth promotion in pigs and turkeys, along with chickens,' writes Avinash Kar for Switchboard . 'So Phibro is keeping open the option to sell penicillin for growth promotion in an even wider range of species while withdrawing combination approvals it was not even using.' In other words, the FDA's suggested guidelines for reducing and eliminating antibiotics likely did not even play a role in Phibro's recent decision, despite what the agency is now claiming. Rather, Phibro has always been in charge of steering its own ship, with the FDA simply posing as pseudo-captain to appease the masses. 'For FDA's plan to have any impact it has to change how antibiotics are used not just how they are labeled, and this action does not meet that goal,' adds Kar. "
0," Artificially sweetened drinks are often promoted as healthy alternatives for weight loss and diabetes because they are low in calories and don't contain sugar. However, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that these diet sodas are harmful to human health. According to Sharon Fowler, MPH, an authority on this subject, 'Diet soda is not a health food. In fact, it's not a food at all, it's simply a slurry of chemicals, a number of which may have deleterious effects on the body.' Most recently diet sodas have been tied to increased risk of stroke and heart attack, and while many people drink them as an aid to weight reduction, research suggests if you drink diet soda, weight gain may be the result instead. Weight gain In one study linking diet beverages to weight gain, Hazuda, et. al. at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, recorded changes in waist circumferences in 474 elderly participants in a 10-year study. As part of the study they controlled for diabetes, physical activity, neighborhood, age, sex and ethnicity. Findings showed that increases in waist sizes were 70 percent greater among those who drank diet soft drinks compared with those who did not. In addition, waist size increases were as much as 500 percent greater amongst those that drank two or more diet sodas a day. In other research, Sharon Fowler and colleagues studied eight years of data based on individuals between 25 and 64. Of the study participants who were of normal weight in the beginning, a third were overweight or obese eight years later. In evaluating the correlation between obesity and diet drinks researchers found that every bottle of diet soda participants drank in a day raised their obesity risk by 41 percent. Diabetes Aspartame, a common sweetener in diet beverages, has also been linked to diabetes. In an animal study conducted at UT San Antonio, researchers fed corn oil-enriched feed to one group of mice and the same feed plus aspartame to another group. Three months later the aspartame group had elevated glucose levels but insulin levels that were equal to or less than those of the control group, suggesting that aspartame may be part of the connection between diet soda consumption and diabetes. Corrupted Signals What is the reason for the diet soda weight gain connection? One theory is that our bodies rely on a signaling system based on the quality of the foods we eat. In the case of diet soda , the body experiences a sweet taste and expects calories; but when they aren't forthcoming starts to crave food, which leads to overeating. Psychologists at Purdue University tested this idea by comparing two groups of rats, one which was fed yogurt with sugar and one which was fed yogurt with saccharine. The saccharine rats ate significantly more calories, gained more weight and put on more body fat than the control group. Sweet Cravings Still another possibility is that eating sweets dulls our taste buds causing us to eat more sugary foods in compensation. Some 2011 research in the UK seems to support this idea. The scientists found that consumption of two cans of soda a day for a month resulted in a noticeable dulling of taste buds and increased cravings for high calorie foods. Since artificial sweeteners (which were not part of this particular study) are 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, it is at least possible that they may have a similar impact on our taste buds. "
0," Mothers who exercise more during pregnancy may give birth to children with higher IQs, according to psychologist Richard E. Nisbett, author of Intelligence and How to Get It . 'Children whose mother exercised 30 minutes a day score around eight points higher on standard IQ tests than children whose mothers were more sedentary,' he said. The Western medical profession once believed that exercise after the first trimester of pregnancy might place the fetus at risk, but new research is increasingly discrediting this idea. The British government recommends that women remain active throughout pregnancy, noting that the more active a woman is, the easier it will be for her body to adapt to the experience of pregnancy and the easier her labor will be. Running, stretching and using light weights are among the exercises that many pregnant women can do easily. 'Exercising large muscle groups increases the growth of neurons and adds to the blood supply of the brain,' Nisbett writes. A woman who exercises during pregnancy and also breastfeeds for at least nine months will raise her child's IQ an average of 14 points, he said. Nisbett says that the way parents interact with their children can also help boost their IQ. He encourages parents to ask their children questions that they already know the answer to, and to explain how they know. This helps children develop the ability to find the answers to their own questions. He also encourages the practice of 'anticipation exercises,' games in which parents encourage children to predict future events, such as where a submerged animal will emerge from the water. Research suggests that mothers are the most important influences in their children's intellectual development, he said, but that fathers contribute relatively little. 'The mother is the most important IQ agent here,' he said. 'In families dominated by a father, there are higher mathematical skills but that's all we contribute, I'm afraid.'

0," Tweet Hundreds of years ago, the forefathers of modern medicine performed live dissections on monkeys and other animals, peeling away layers of skin and muscle to observe the operating organs deep inside. The screams and cries of the animals were thought to be just reflexes. Today, it's common sense that all mammals feel and experience pain, but it has also been long believed that fish and other forms of animal life don't. Fishing isn't cruel, sportsmen have argued, because the fish don't have the brain power to really experience pain. New research demolishes that flawed belief. Fish do feel and experience pain. They may not be as smart as primates, but they're not so stupid that they can't feel a hook ripping their digestive organs out through their mouths. Naturally, sportsmen are screaming bloody murder at this. Or, actually, they're screaming that fishing is not bloody murder. It's just an innocent sport, something you do with the family. Something you do to bond with nature. Hunters cite the exact same arguments. 'Deer don't feel any pain,' they insist. Although, in truth, it takes a rather imaginative distortion of reality to insist that a mammal running through the woods, leaving a trail of fresh blood two miles long, somehow didn't feel anything. In time, as additional research like this emerges, more people will begin to ask the important question: 'Why is maiming animals for entertainment still legal in a civilized society?' Analysis: Fish feel pain. Fishermen disagree. Expect to see more people questioning the 'sports' of fishing and hunting as more research like this emerges. "
0," It doesn't matter if you consume it accidentally in food, inject it via vaccine, or let it leech for years into your mouth from a dental filling; mercury is toxic to the body in all its forms. Gratefully, the negative effects of mercury can be mitigated by essential fatty acids. New research suggests that mercury consumed from seafood may actually be the least of a consumer's worries because of the superior nutrition quality of the fish itself. Health conscious consumers are careful not to eat too much fish because of the mercury that has bio-accumulated in the tissues of the fish. Coal-fired power plants let off mercury byproducts into the environment, into the water and the oceans. Over time the mercury works its way up the food chain and into fish. However, it turns out that the nutritional quality of the fish may outweigh the harmful effects of the mercury found in the fish. This is according to findings from the University of Rochester Ulster University , and the Republic of Seychelles Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education . Their findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish counteract the negative effects of mercury In three decades of research, Seychelles shows that a high level of fish consumption by pregnant mothers does not illicit developmental problems in their children. There is no damage done even when pregnant mothers ate an average of 12 seafood meals per week. Research indicates that the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in fish actually counteract the negative effects that mercury have on the human brain. 'These findings show no overall association between prenatal exposure to mercury through fish consumption and neurodevelopmental outcomes,' said Edwin van Wijngaarden, Ph.D., and associate professor in the University of Rochester Department of Public Health Sciences and a co-author of the study. 'It is also becoming increasingly clear that the benefits of fish consumption may outweigh, or even mask, any potentially adverse effects of mercury.' The finding also underscores the importance for pregnant women to consume adequate amounts of beneficial fatty acids to protect their child in the womb. 'This research provided us the opportunity to study the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids on development and their potential to augment or counteract the toxic properties of mercury,' said Sean Strain, Ph.D., a professor of Human Nutrition at the Ulster University in Northern Ireland and lead author of the study. 'The findings indicate that the type of fatty acids a mother consumes before and during pregnancy may make a difference in terms of their child's future neurological development.' Essential fatty acids protect the brain from environmental contaminants The study investigated the lives of 89,000 people living on the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean. The people there consume fish 10 times the amount of populations in Europe and the US. The study followed 1500 mothers and their children. The researchers collected hair samples from the pregnant mothers to determine mercury exposure. The children were then put through several tests at 20 months that looked at motor skills, communication and behavior. The researchers found out that mercury exposure from fish and other seafood did not affect the children's test scores. Some of the children were followed into their twenties. Still there was no association between fish consumption and neurological dysfunction. The researchers found that mercury exposure did not correlate with lower test scores. This finding tracked with the results of previous studies by the group - some of which have followed children in the Seychelles into their 20s - that have also shown no association between fish consumption and subsequent neurological development. In fact, the children with the highest level of omega-3 fatty acids from fish actually performed better on the tests. On top of that, the anti-inflammatory properties of the omega-3 fatty acids helped reverse the inflammation and oxidation caused by mercury, counteracting the toxin. FDA warns about mercury in fish but goes silent about mercury fillings and injections The U.S. Food and Drug Administration places heavy emphasis on the mercury content in fish and practically scares people away from seafood consumption. Hypocritically the FDA does little to set guidelines and bring awareness to the other forms of mercury exposure like direct injections of thimerosal into the blood via flu vaccines or constant exposure to the toxin through dental amalgams. This study is unique because it makes these medical methods of mercury exposure seem more dangerous since they are not naturally accompanied by beneficial polyunsaturated fats (as found in fish) which protect the brain as it is being exposed to mercury.

0," In furtherance of the medical monopoly that dominates western civilization today, the FDA issued warning letters to three companies over what they call fraudulent health claims regarding Ebola treatments. The warning letters, viewable here , single out the Natural Solutions Foundation (Rima Laibow) and two essential oil companies 'Young Living' and 'doTerra' whose distributors, the FDA says, were making claims that their oils could treat or prevent Ebola. The warning letters threaten all three companies with possible criminal prosecutions if they do not immediately answer the FDA and FTC with explanations of how they plan to halt the making of such claims. As of this writing, the e-commerce website of the Natural Solutions Foundation appears to have already removed any mention of Ebola. 'An FDA agent showed up at my front door on September 23, 2014, to hand deliver [highly unusual!] a Warning Letter from that agency and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advising Natural Solutions that telling the truth about Ebola, Nano Silver and CBD is, according to those agencies, against their version of the law,' wrote Ralph Fucetola in this rebuttal letter entitled 'We will not be suppressed!' Fucetola goes on to write: FDA and FTC are simply wrong about the law. And during the Ebola Epidemic their actions actively violate the July, 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) pronouncement that, during this crisis, offering even 'unproven interventions' is ethical. What is not ethical is the position taken by the FDA and FTC. Update: doTerra has responded with this email announcement to its wellness advocates (consultants), clarifying its position on the issue: Because doTERRA products are natural products and are not registered with the FDA as drugs, we are restricted on the health claims that can be made for marketing purposes. We recognize essential oils have profound health benefits, but it is important we not make claims that would position our products as drugs. For example, recommending an essential oil to cure a particular disease would be considered a drug claim. doTERRA does not claim our products cure or treat the Ebola virus or any other disease. doTERRA works closely with you, our Wellness Advocates, to ensure marketing materials are compliant. Please understand the FDA is not suggesting doTERRA is making claims in our marketing materials or labeling. Rather, they are encouraging us to make Wellness Advocates aware they should not make drug claims when marketing doTERRA products. Beyond the warning letters, here's the rest of the story the national press isn't reporting While I agree that no claims of treatment or cures should ever be made against any disease until they are supported by substantial evidence, there are some shocking facts about all this that both the FDA and FTC are conveniently ignoring: Fact #1) The FDA refuses to conduct any testing on natural or alternative therapies (such as colloidal silver) in order to find out whether they work or not. What if some of these alternative medicines actually do work, but the medical monopoly doesn't want us to find out? Fact #2) The FDA openly rubber-stamped the treatment of Ebola patients with the entirely unproven, experimental drug 'ZMapp,' which has so far resulted in around a 40% fatality rate in Ebola patients. How exactly is it that an unproven pharmaceutical is okay to use as a treatment for Ebola, but an unproven herb or natural remedy is completely unacceptable and possibly illegal? (The double standard of so-called 'science' is breathtaking...) Where is the FDA's warning letter to the manufacturer of ZMapp? Oh, wait... instead of receiving a warning letter from the FDA, the ZMapp manufacturer received a $42 million grant from Health and Human Services . Fact #3) The FDA openly allows billions of dollars of pharmaceuticals to be prescribed each year for health conditions they were never approved for! This is called 'off-label prescribing' and it's a huge part of the pharmaceutical industry's profit model. The way it works is that a drug company receives a limited FDA approval for the drug to treat a specific, limited health condition, then that drug company engages in widespread bribery and kickbacks to doctors to encourage them to prescribe the drug for all sorts of other conditions that have never been backed by clinical trials or scientific evidence of any kind. All the while, the company claims the drug is 'FDA approved,' but not for the health conditions for which it is commonly prescribed! In truth, many of the drugs U.S. consumers are prescribed for certain health conditions aren't backed by any evidence at all. The illusion of so-called 'evidence-based medicine' across the pharmaceutical industry is truly an elaborate myth. The FDA doesn't even conduct any testing of pharmaceuticals at all and instead relies on drug companies to submit their own tests... which are often fabricated or falsified . Fact #4) The United States government claims patent ownership over Ebola and all its variants . The patent number is CA2741523A1 and you can view it here. The existence of this patent means that no company can even conduct scientific tests with Ebola viruses without running afoul of U.S. patent laws. Even worse, any company possessing Ebola would probably find its principals arrested and charged as terrorists under the U.S. Patriot Act which has specific provisions regarding 'biological terrorism.' This combination of 'anti-terrorism' laws and U.S. patent laws creates an actual monopoly of research on Ebola treatments. Only the government itself can authorize such research, and it is of course entirely beholden to pharmaceutical interests. This is why all research funding for Ebola cures is strictly limited to vaccines and pharma drugs. No other alternatives are even tested or considered. Fact #5) The FDA has never shown that colloidal silver or natural cures don't work to help prevent Ebola. Granted, we can't expect the agency to run around testing everything in sight just to find out what doesn't work, but shouldn't a few of the more likely natural remedies be studied against Ebola in the interests of the public good? Despite all the talk by the FDA (and the mainstream media) about 'bogus cures,' the simple scientific truth is that such status has never been established. No government organization or medical group has ever tried colloidal silver against Ebola. So how, exactly, are they so sure it's a 'bogus' cure? A more technically accurate term would be 'unproven.' And I agree that colloidal silver is indeed an 'unproven' treatment vs. Ebola, as is everything else. Abandoning scientific thinking and embracing the dogma of assumed pharmaceutical efficacy Personally, I've never seen any convincing documentation that colloidal silver treats Ebola. But at the same time I've never seen any evidence that ZMapp treats Ebola, either... yet that drug was irrationally and enthusiastically heralded as a 'miracle' treatment for Ebola even when it utterly lacked any evidence whatsoever of safety or efficacy. When it comes to global pandemics, science be damned! All the institutions that control the conversation -- the FDA, CDC and national press -- automatically ASSUME that drugs will work and natural substances won't. This assumption is invoked by default, almost as a Pavlovian response among drug regulators, without a single shred of evidence to support it. That's not science; it's dogma (with a special emphasis on the drooling dog, of course). Here at selfnews, I've consistently repeated that NOTHING has yet been proven to treat, prevent or cure Ebola . Thus, all medicines -- natural, conventional or otherwise -- are 'experimental and unproven' by definition. And yet, amazingly, any experimental and unproven medicines produced by drug companies automatically enjoy the faith-based default belief that they are safe and effective while any experimental and unproven medicines synthesized by Mother Nature are assumed to be dangerous and useless. It is my belief that these assumptions are upside-down. Plant-based medicines have been effectively used for thousands of years to fight plagues in regions like ancient China, for example. There is already a track record of plant-based medicine being used throughout human history to halt the spread of disease. The fact that the FDA refuses to acknowledge the existence of that historical record does not make it disappear from human civilization. And while we should never leap to the conclusion that such plants are useful for modern-day Ebola, shouldn't we at least TEST them and find out for sure? If any of us claim to be scientists at all, then shouldn't the scope of our curiosity for expanded knowledge be large enough to encompass all the available systems of medicine? Or have our scientific minds now become so narrow and limited that the search for the cure for the world's most dangerous Ebola outbreak must be limited solely to synthetic chemicals that can be patented by powerful corporations who already have a track record of committing felony fraud? (GSK, the company testing the Ebola vaccine on humans right now, was caught committing felony bribery crimes in both the United States and China and has paid literally billions of dollars in fines as a 'buyout' for those crimes.) There is a cure for Ebola, and it's programmed into your DNA right now There is one natural cure for Ebola that has already been proven to work about 50% of the time. It's called the human immune system . Every person who has survived Ebola so far has been saved by it. It is, by definition, a legitimate 'cure' for Ebola. Big Pharma and the FDA won't tell you this for the simple reason that they can't sell you your own immune system . You already got it for free. Will the FDA now send warning letters to Ebola survivors, threatening them with criminal arrest if they don't stop 'treating' themselves with their own immune systems? The astonishing power of the immune system to saves lives is exactly why I've openly called for doctors, hospitals and institutions of medicine to find ways to support that miraculous immune system. If the immune system already has the potential to save about 50% of those infected, what might happen if we find simple, low-cost ways to enhance the human immune system? Could immune support protocols boost Ebola survival rates to 60, 70 or even 90 percent? The truth is we'll never know under the current medical cartel. And we won't know because such research is effectively banned and oppressed by the scientific dictatorship that runs our western medical system which is itself steeped in felony crimes, human medical experimentation and research fraud. How many people must die while western medicine suppresses research into natural remedies? If this Ebola outbreak continues to explode as is now predicted by the CDC, there's no telling how many hundreds of thousands of lives may be unnecessarily lost due to the monopolistic, knowledge-suppressing activities of the medical cartel. In the quest to protect the profits of the vaccine makers, government regulators seem happy to stand by and watch countless victims die even when effective natural remedies may exist right this very minute and be readily available. In a world dominated by western imperialist medicine and corporate interests, there is no limit to the number of human victims who will be sacrificed to protect profits. And that's the saddest part of this entire story. The serious fraud isn't coming from people like Rima Laibow who talked up colloidal silver as an Ebola remedy; the real fraud is coming from the medical cartel which actively censors any and all scientific research into natural remedies which could one day save millions of lives in a true 'global killer' pandemic outbreak. Until we stop allowing so-called 'science' to be unduly influenced by corporate interests, we'll never know what the best cures for Ebola might be. Perhaps the best cure is found in some tree-bound fungi growing in the rainforest. Perhaps it's a chemical compound found in a rare sea sponge. Or heck, maybe it's a nutrient growing in dandelion roots in your own back yard. The truth is we'll never know because the system of imperialist western medicine absolutely refuses to let anyone even ask the question (or conduct the research). The mere discussion of such medical alternatives is practically a crime in America today. Why we must explore the full diversity of human knowledge if we are to save ourselves I happen to believe that if we are going to solve the Ebola pandemic problem, we need to work together as a world community , exploring all the available knowledge of every system of medicine known to humankind. Western medicine may have a valuable role to play, but it surely isn't the only medicine available today. All across our planet, other systems of medicine are valuable, safe, effective and readily available. These include Amazon rainforest medicine, Australian Aborigine medicine, Tibetan medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Western herbal medicine, homeopathic medicine and many more. To pretend that one and only one system of medicine has anything to offer is foolish beyond description. If we hope to survive this outbreak, we must set aside our monopolistic profit motives and test ALL kinds of medicines that are available everywhere around the world . After all, if the science of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies is truly scientific, then isn't it scientific enough to also test the efficacy of herbal medicines? Chinese medicines? Homeopathic medicines? Why not conduct the science and let the answers speak for themselves? Why can't our government fund scientific research into non-patented, everyday remedies that are affordable for the citizens of developing nations? Only then can we know we've exhausted the search for cures, treatments or prevention medicines. If western medicine comes out on top after that exhaustive search, then it will have earned that position. But if western medicine is simply declared superior while all other medicines are maliciously excluded by a monopolistic medical regime, then we can only assume we're witnessing the actions of a sham system of dishonest medicine that profits from the suppression of knowledge rather than its discovery.

0," In the wake of recent revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) and other government snoops are monitoring the electronic communications of U.S. citizens, millions of us wanted to know what, if anything, we could do to protect our email, cell phone conversations, chat sessions from Big Brother in the future. Now, granted, the technological capabilities of the NSA are massive. And, as was revealed in subsequent news reports following the initial revelations about the NSA, tech companies and Internet Service Providers are in cahoots with the government, so they're not going to protect you. Further, the Fourth Amendment appears to mean nothing to the Obama Aadministration. What's a poor, hapless citizen to do? First off, take a deep breath and read on. There are things you can do. 'Pretty Good Privacy' Per Slate : Not every communication can be tracked and eavesdropped on by the government, however, and there are ways to reduce the chances of being snooped on. First, instead of browsing the Internet in a way that reveals your IP address, you can mask your identity by using an anonymizing tool like Tor (https://www.torproject.org) or by connecting to the Web using a Virtual Private Network (https://www.torproject.org). Additionally, you can avoid Google search by using an alternative like Ixquick (https://ixquick.com/eng/), which has solid privacy credentials and says it does not log any IP addresses or search terms or share information with third parties. Want to send protected email? You can do that as well. If you happen to be using a commercial email provider like Google, Yahoo! or another service identified as having been co-opted by PRISM, the NSA's snoop program, you can certainly slow down the agency by sending and receiving emails encrypted with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), which has been around for years, or a free alternative, GPG ( http://www.gnupg.org/ ). Both of these products can be used to encrypt and decrypt email messages - unless, however, you have Trojan spyware installed on your machine. 'Novice computer users learning how to use PGP or GPG may find it a daunting prospect at first, but there are plenty of tutorials online for both Mac and Windows users that can help guide you through the process,' says Slate If you happen to be a journalist and you are working with confidential sources or an attorney seeking to protect attorney-client conversations - or if you just require security communications - learning how to use either of these protective programs will be a must in the near- and long-term. Organizations or firms could go even further and stop using a third-party service and instead set up their own email server, 'helping ensure no secret court orders can be filed to gain covert access to confidential files,' Slate reports. Private documents can be stored online, if necessary, and kept shielded using Cloudfogger ( http://www.cloudfogger.com/en/ ) in conjunction with Dropbox . Instant messaging and phone or video chats can be better protected if you avoid using Microsoft and Google-based services such as Skype and Gchat and instead adopt more secure forms of communication. Those include Jitsi ( https://jitsi.org/ ), which can be utilized for peer-to-peer calls video calls that are encrypted. Set-up takes some time but it'll be worth it For encrypted instant message chats you could try an 'off the record' plugin like Pidgin ( http://www.pidgin.im/ ) for Windows users and Adium ( http://adium.im/ ) for Mac machines. For instant messaging and online phone or video chats, you can avoid Microsoft and Google services like Skype and Gchat by adopting more secure alternatives. Jitsi can be used for peer-to-peer encrypted video calls, and for encrypted instant message chats you can try using an 'off the record' plugin with Pidgin for Windows users or Adium for Mac. 'Like using PGP encryption, both Pidgin and Adium can take a little bit of work to set up - but there are tutorials to help ease the pain, like this ( www.encrypteverything.ca ) for setting up Adium and this ( https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat ) tutorial for Pidgin,' Slate notes. Technology advances have made it nearly effortless for governments to spy on citizens. While this practice is common in other countries, the U.S. Constitution, under the Fourth Amendment, absolutely prohibits the kind of blanket surveillance being conducted by the NSA . That the agency received permission to do so from the FISA court - which conducts its business in secret - is not the same thing as having the authority to do so. If that were the case federal courts could grant any number of federal agencies permission to violate every single provision of the Constitution. That said, it is highly unlikely those responsible for ordering the NSA to spy on American citizens are going to be reprimanded, so the best thing you can do in the meantime is protect your electronic communications as best as you can.

0," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is launching an investigation into a still-unexplained collection of symptoms known as Morgellons disease. The condition known as Morgellons disease is characterized primarily by skin lesions that do not heal, as well as unexplained sensations of crawling, biting or stinging on the skin; the presence of foreign materials, such as fibers, on or under the skin; fatigue; joint pain; memory loss; mental confusion and vision changes. Because doctors do not know what causes the symptoms, some have questioned whether it is a real physical condition. According to the Morgellons Research Foundation, many Morgellons patients are falsely 'diagnosed with a common medical label, Delusions of Parasitosis, the basic tenet being this is a psychiatric illness with the presumption of a purely delusional 'parasite infestation.'' The CDC investigation will involve patients enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan who saw medical attention for Morgellons-like symptoms within an 18-month time period. It will also involve cooperation from the Armed Forces Pathology Institute, and is expected to last for at least one year. Patients involved in the study will undergo thorough examinations of both mental and physical health. When asked if she believes that Morgellons disease is a real medical condition, lead researcher Michele Pearson said, 'What I can tell you is real is the suffering that these patients are experiencing. I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, as a disease. I can tell you it's an unexplained illness.' The Morgellons Research Foundation says that it has identified at least 11,000 families around the world that have at least one member who suffers from Morgellons disease. Executive Director Mary Leitao said that the CDC investigation is an important step toward finding out more about the condition, which she believes is 'an infectious disease.' "
0," It has been noted that one of the most popular requests in wellness stores is for products to help ease stomach pain naturally. People, from cancer patients to parents of babies suffering from colic, try to look for the safest and most effective way of dealing with stomach pain. There is actually no natural cure that will aid all types of stomach pain, but if the pain has been persisting for some time, you need the help of a doctor. For simple pains due to menstrual cramps or the ingestion of food that is already spoiled, there are many natural alternatives to make the stomach calm down. Natural Stomach Pain Killers Here's a rundown of 12 home and herbal remedies that can help soothe various types of belly discomfort: 1. Ginger Ginger is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties plus other benefits. This also helps in easing stomach pains, as well as aiding in digestion. One can take this by peeling and grating the ginger and making a tea out of it. For people who do not like spicy foods, ginger supplements may be better, as ginger can be a bit spicy. It is better to make a tea out of fresh ginger than to buy ginger ale, as the latter is already full of sugar. Conventional sugar can further aggravate stomach pain. 2. Fennel or licorice These are similar in taste even though they come from different plants. These have a taste that not all people like, so if one does not like the taste, it is best to settle with other alternatives. Fennel and licorice are found in a lot of herbal teas, as well as supplements. To those who are alright with the taste, chewing a fresh slice (bulb) can ease stomach pain . 3. Chamomile Chamomile doesn't only calm one's nerves but also soothes a painful stomach. People can take chamomile tea for upset stomachs. For additional flavor, lemon can be added to the tea. 4. Peppermint Mint, similar to ginger, should be taken fresh in order to settle an upset stomach . Simply take a few sprigs of mint and put them in a cup of warm water. Chewing on a leaf can also help. 5. Lemon water To those who have no ginger, licorice, mint or fennel at home, squeezing half of a lemon into a mug with warm water can help soothe the stomach too. 6. Baking soda Antacids that are sold in the market typically have sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda. People can simply take a teaspoon or two and mix it into a mug of warm water. This is as good as taking Alka-Seltzer to get rid of indigestion or heartburn. 7. Warm salt water Salt water is good for sore throats as well as upset stomachs. A teaspoon of salt mixed in a cup of warm water will surely do the trick. In order to get the best results, it is recommended to drink the water as fast as one can. 8. Warm rice compress Heat is known as one of the best methods to soothe an upset stomach, especially when it comes to cramps. To those who have no heating pads at home, they can make one out of an old sock plus some uncooked rice. Place it inside the microwave for a minute and use on the affected area. 9. Burned toast Charcoal is popular in the hospital for cases of alcohol or food poisoning, as it helps to neutralize the poison in the body. Burnt toast is commonly used to treat children with stomachaches or diarrhea, so too are bananas, rice and applesauce (BRAT). 10. Cola syrup This has been used for a long time to treat upset stomachs. Cola syrup has been deemed safe for children, as well as delicious. 11. Apple cider vinegar This vinegar is said to be very beneficial to the body. A few teaspoons mixed in a glass of warm or cold water can help alleviate the pain . 12. Aloe vera juice People who have intestinal problems have reported that this juice is very helpful. It can help get rid of cramps, gas, diarrhea and bloating. These are 12 popular remedies to help treat stomach pain. However, if the pain is persistent even with the use of these remedies, immediate medical help should be sought. "
0," Diseases that were once confined to eras of old, long before the days of modern medicine, are making a huge comeback, according to experts. And it's not people opting out of vaccination that's the problem -- more people today are succumbing to Victorian diseases like cholera, gout and whooping cough because they aren't getting enough nutrition, suggests a new study, and because they're living like over-indulgent royalty. An evaluation of statistics compiled by the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has revealed that cases of scarlet fever and the inflammatory arthritic condition gout have nearly doubled just within the last five years. Between 2013 and 2014, there were more than 86,000 hospital admissions for patients diagnosed with gout, a 16 percent increase over the year prior, and a 78 percent increase over the previous five years. Traditionally associated with overindulgence in unhealthy junk foods and alcohol, gout is on the upswing as an increasing number of people are living like kings, so to speak, consuming excess amounts of food rich in processed sugar and oxidized fats, and devoid of life-giving nutrients. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) says there's been a 71 percent increase in hospital admissions for patients suffering from malnutrition, despite people eating more food. This deadly combination of malnutrition and excessive junk food and alcohol consumption is wreaking havoc on public health, say experts, who are seeing a massive influx of cases of thought-to-be mostly extinct medical conditions -- or at least medical conditions that typically only afflict the elderly. Many younger adults are now falling ill with these types of diseases , a sign that there is a major shift occurring in the public health paradigm. Globalization causing ancient diseases to become modern diseases Sanitation issues are also contributing to the problem, with infectious diseases like scarlet fever and cholera making a comeback. Cholera, as explained by The Telegraph , was mostly prevalent during the 19th century, spreading primarily through contaminated water. And though not nearly as many people today contract it as did back then, the numbers are rising, and some see this as a cause for concern. 'When you look at something like gout it may be that this comes down to an ageing population, coupled with a steep rise in obesity and a population that is drinking more alcohol. Statistics like this raise an awful lot of questions,' said Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, about the phenomenon. 'Something like cholera is a canary in the coal mine - it's almost certainly imported from elsewhere and it's a reminder of the global dependency when it comes to health , and the movement of disease from one country to another.' The statistics show that poorer people are the most prone to these diseases, presumably because they eat lower-quality food and have less access to proper medical care. But all segments of society are seeing increases in disease prevalence, which stands to add an enormous burden to the healthcare system that will have to treat all these folks down the road. 'It is fascinating to look at current statistics for some of the diseases and conditions that were prevalent in the 1800s and early 1900s,' said Kingsley Manning, chairman of the HSCIC. 'We are fortunate that these diseases are not as widespread today, however our figures do show that hospital admissions for gout are increasing.' He added, 'Healthcare organisations may be interested in undertaking further study into the trends highlighted in our report.' "
0," As the US federal government continues to evaluate whether or not to approve AquaBounty's genetically-modified (GM) 'AquAdvantage' salmon, Canada's Cohen Commission (CC), a group established by the nation's government to track the decline of Sockeye salmon in the Fraser River, has announced some shocking information. According to a recent report, AquAdvantage being raised at a land-based, isolated site on Prince Edward Island have been found to be contaminated with Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA), a serious viral disease that affects Atlantic salmon. Catherine Stewart from the Living Oceans Society and Coastal Alliance for Aquaculture Reform recently gave an interview in which she explained the mysterious ISA discovery in the 'Frankenfish.' According to the CC report, Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) back in 2009 that there had been an outbreak of ISA at the Prince Edward Island facility raising AquAdvantage salmon. 'I think we have to ask the question, 'How did this get into this facility?' This is a land-based, closed-tank system that's raising these genetically-engineered fish,' said Stewart. 'It could only have come through the eggs or the smolts, or through water that the facility pumps from the bay into their facility.' AquaBounty is the same company, of course, that has been trying to ramrod US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its highly-allergenic AquAdvantage Frankenfish without so much as a shred of independent, legitimate scientific evidence proving that the imitation fish is safe for humans and the environment, or that it will not reproduce and destroy stocks of wild salmon all over the world ( http://www.selfnews.com/GM_salmon.html ). Meanwhile, this Prince Edward Island scandal clearly illustrates that AquaBounty is incapable of even protecting its own protected stocks of fish from disease, let alone protect the world's oceans from contamination. If the company cannot even maintain its own disease-free, protected environment, how can it be trusted not to release GM fish and their traits into the wild? 'Was AquaBounty getting [its] eggs from Norway, Scotland, and were these ISA-infected eggs? We don't know,' added Stewart. 'And if [AquaBounty] had that disease in its facility, what's happening to the water they are dumping into the bay? What percentage of the water they use in this facility is recirculated, and what percentage goes out as effluent into the receiving waters, and does that effluent water contain the ISA virus? Are they treating the effluent? Again, we don't know.' Be sure to watch the entire interview with Stewart at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVh4TRey0OE "
0," Start this whole thing off with ingredients that you probably aren't sure of and which appear in tons and tons of foods that you probably consume regularly: canola oil, TBHQ, sodium benzoate, soy lecithin, polysaccharides and carrageenan. Then throw in BHT for freshness. How about some natural flavors, natural colors (bugs) and 'all natural' GMOs, and what have you got? You've got gluten-free foods that are horrible for your health and contain MSG and other toxic food criminals known as food agents. Think of food agents as undercover bad guys who sneak into your body, arriving quite often in a 'Trojan horse' (your healthy choice) and inflicting damage on your central nervous system, your body's alkalinity and your cells' DNA structure. Wait, did the 'level' of insidiousness here dip too deep already for you? Is that gray area more like a black hole in space? How wide is YOUR gray area? Let's talk about a bunch more food agents, fillers, toxins and carcinogenic 'activity' that frequents your daily intake, like CIA agents posing as your friends. Check out some of these infamous 'additive' words and phrases and other catchy 'healthy-sounding' slogans that make you think some ingredient is safe or even good for you: '... for added freshness' -- that means 'kills mold and fungus,' and it also mutates and/or kills human cells, weakening immunity. '... as a preservative' -- means it chokes your mitochondria (cells) and fuels the development of cancer. '... for added flavor' or 'to protect flavor.' '... a color enhancer' (probably a toxic coal tar derivative). 'Processed in a plant' -- means cooked until all available nutrition is destroyed. 'Homogenized and pasteurized' means it was cooked real fast at high heat to ruin the beneficial enzymes and nutrition. 'Hydrolyzed' means the degradation of a substance. 'Fortified' and 'Enriched' both mean that some dead vitamins or minerals were added back into some dead processed food so the manufacturer can claim the food 'product' contains something nutritious on the label. The FDA allows this and has for years . 'RDA' -- Recommended Daily Allowance -- means absolutely nothing and is based on receiving dead nutrition from dead food from food groups that shouldn't even exist. 'Other ingredients' -- this section often contains all kinds of toxins, like talc (toxic powder). Also watch out for rennet (calf stomach lining in cheese), food coloring from beetles and bugs, food coloring from petroleum (toxic coal tar) and GMOs, including DNA from insects that kills other insects and from animals that infect human tissue . If you take supplements with gelatin capsules, you are consuming animal hides, hooves and cartilage! Watch for TBHQ, a petroleum derivative, used as a stabilizer in perfumes, resins, varnishes and oil field chemicals, which has been linked to stomach tumors and DNA damage. Also look out for BHA and BHT. Big Food exploits the 'gray matter' Are you not sure of something? It could be giving you cancer. Are you not quite sure about some ingredient that you've been consuming? It could come from abused animals that are shot up with drugs like artificial growth hormones and overused antibiotics that create superbugs! Are you not sure about 'other ingredients,' or do you not even look at those? Do you think because something also says organic, or even certified organic, that it's 'good to go?' You could be eating dangerous amounts of heavy metals that exist in certified organic products the USA imports from China. Are you suffering from lead and cadmium poisoning, or was it just aluminum and mercury? Is this just a 'gray area' of concern, or should it be your MAJOR concern? Let's exploit their exploitation of us now. Let's talk about toxic food, other ingredients, additives, preservatives and all natural stuff. Let's have an open discussion about the search for the cure for 'Agent Orange Food Disorder.' ( http://www.selfnews.com ) Maybe, just maybe, that fibromyalgia and psoriasis will just evaporate when you filter out all the toxins from your food, drink and skin care products . Maybe that IBS, Crohn's and diverticulitis will all dry up and fade away when you process the information contained in the language of fake food and tricky phrases that make you think that it's safe. Top 10 'gray areas' exploited 1. Sodium benzoate : This stealthy killer flies under most people's radar and is found in just about everything in jars and bottles, like salad dressing, pickles, sauces, mayonnaise, almost all soda and juice drinks, and even in foods labeled as 'all natural .' 2. Canola oil : This artificial, Canadian-exported GMO product is super popular and is found in over 30% of all products. 3. Monosodium glutamate (MSG): The FDA allows 20 'pseudo' names for MSG, including autolyzed yeast extract, free glutamate, glutamic acid, soy lecithin, calcium caseinate, hydrolyzed corn, hydrolyzed soy protein and maltodextrin, to name a few. Just because a product says 'No MSG' doesn't mean that it's not in there! 4. Sodium nitrates (nitrosamines): Used for fertilizers and explosives, and as a solvent in the dry cleaning industry. 5. Margarine : The body cannot incorporate trans fatty acids into membranes; doing so causes cellular structures to be deformed. Vegetable shortening and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils accelerate aging and degenerative changes in tissues. 6. Anti-foaming agents (dimethylpolysiloxane): An industrial chemical used in caulks and sealants. This component is mostly used in fast food chicken nuggets and eggs. 7. Anti-caking agents : Chemicals that absorb moisture and prevent other compounds from sticking together. These are added to table salt and powdered food products. 8. Artificial colorings : Synthetic petrochemicals made from petroleum, antifreeze and ammonia. Blue #1 causes kidney tumors in mice. 9. Emulsifiers : Carrageenan, polysorbate 80 and brominated vegetable oil (BVO). These are stabilizing, smoothing and thickening agents. BVO remains in body fat for years. Polysorbate 80 is also found in most vaccines. 10. Artificial Sweeteners : Aspartame, acesulfame K, sucralose, sorbitol, Truvia and, of course, saccharin. Because they taste sweet, these chemical sweeteners trick the body into absorbing and holding on to them for extended periods of time, as they turn rancid in the body's fat. Fake sugars are the 'Trojan horses' of the cell-choking and -mutating food agent industry. Sorbitol is also found in many vaccines. "
0," Ex-smokers and others looking to give their lungs a natural health boost can find help in a surprising place: the sweet potato. And the healthful qualities of this remarkable vegetable don't end at the lungs: They extend to various types of cancer, and to a wide range of other health benefits. Sweet potatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ) have been consumed by human beings for thousands of years. There are more than 8,000 varieties, ranging in color from white to purple though yellow and orange varieties are most common, and are the types most strongly linked to lung health. Although people in the United States typically eat only the tuber of the plant, its leaves, roots and vines are also edible and cancer-fighting. Eat more sweet potato... leaves! Research into the effects of sweet potatoes on your lungs centers on the plant's high concentration of beta-carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin plays many important roles in the body, including in the health of the eyes, bones and immune system. Among other things, vitamin A and other carotenoids have been shown to aid in lung regeneration, including in people with emphysema. Another study, conducted by Taiwanese researchers and published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2007, gave food frequency questionnaires to 301 people with lung cancer, along with 602 hospital controls and 602 neighborhood controls. They found that people who ate the most sweet potato leaves were 43 to 65 percent less likely to develop lung cancer than those who ate the least. The study also found that those who had higher intakes of vitamin A, alpha-carotene or beta-carotene had a significantly lower risk of lung cancer. Overall vegetable intake was also associated with lower risk, although sweet potato leaves and garland chrysanthemum had the strongest effect. Not just for your lungs But the cancer-fighting benefits of sweet potatoes don't end there. Studies have shown that sweet potato extracts may reduce breast cancer tumor growth and inhibit leukemia cell growth; that the antioxidant anthocyanin (found in sweet potatoes and in red, blue and purple fruits and vegetables) reduces liver cancer tumor growth in mice; and that sweet potato intake may reduce the risk of gallbladder cancer in human beings. Another study found that while high intake of three to four separate varieties of starchy roots and tubers including sweet potatoes , potatoes and taro root had no effect on rates of kidney disease, it did significantly reduce death rates from the disease. It may not be just carotenoids that are responsible for these benefits. Sweet potatoes are also high in the antioxidant polyphenols caffeic acid, dicaffeoylquinic acid and tricaffeoylquinic acid, which may also have cancer-fighting effects. Sweet potatoes are also high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin C, riboflavoin, magnesium, manganese, potassium, calcium and iron. Their complex sugars make sweet potatoes an ideal food for diabetics and others who struggle with blood sugar levels, while their high fiber content may aid digestion and fight colon cancer. Among vegetables, they are high in vitamin D, which plays a critical role in the functioning of the immune system. High levels of potassium and vitamin B6, along with fiber, make sweet potatoes a great food for your heart. Vitamin B6 also helps prevent strokes and degenerative diseases. The beta-carotene in sweet potatoes also promotes healthy hair growth and prevents hair damage. You can even get another use out of the water you use to boil sweet potatoes: You can use it as a wash or bath to cleanse pores, remove toxins and soothe irritated skin. "
0," Study after study continues to show that eating broccoli helps to prevent and treat cancer. And a new study out of the University of Illinois (U of I) says that combining broccoli with broccoli sprouts nearly doubles the cruciferous vegetable's anti-cancer effects. 'Broccoli, prepared correctly, is an extremely potent cancer-fighting agent -- three to five servings a week are enough to have an effect,' said Elizabeth Jeffery, a U of I professor of nutrition that worked on the study. 'To get broccoli's benefits, though, the enzyme myrosinase has to be present; if it's not there, sulforaphane, broccoli's cancer-preventive and anti-inflammatory component, doesn't form.' Previous research on the cancer-preventing benefits of broccoli have found that overcooking broccoli results in the elimination of up to 90 percent of the vegetable's anti-cancer compounds. ( http://www.selfnews.com/025893_broccoli_s... ). However, gently cooking broccoli in a steamer, not in the microwave, can potentially unlock more of its anti-cancer compounds than are present when eating the vegetable raw. Jeffrey and her colleagues compared blood levels of sulforaphane among a group of men who ate meals containing either broccoli sprouts alone, broccoli powder alone, or both combined. They found that in just three hours after finishing their meals, participants who ate both the powder and the sprouts had nearly twice as much of the anti-cancer substance in their systems than the two other groups did. 'There was almost a twofold increase in sulforaphane absorption when sprouts and powder were eaten together,' said Jeffrey. 'It changed the way the subjects metabolized the powder. We saw plasma and urine metabolites much earlier and at much higher levels than when either was eaten alone.' Jeffrey and her team say that combining other sulforaphane-rich foods like mustard, radishes, arugula, and wasabi, along with broccoli and broccoli sprouts, will increase the benefits even further. But she warns that taking certain broccoli supplements in lieu of actual broccoli and broccoli sprouts may not work, as some broccoli supplements do not contain the vital enzyme myrosinase that produces sulforaphane.

0," While still refraining from issuing a formal definition on the term 'natural,' the FDA has ruled that high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) definitely does not qualify for the label. The decision is significant for the food and beverage industries, where 'natural' is a prized and highly contested label. While the Corn Refiners Association trade group has maintained that HFCS, derived from corn, is a natural sweetener, this claim has been disputed by the competing Sugar Association and by consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest. In 2007, both Cadbury Schweppes and Kraft decided to remove 'natural' labels from products containing HFCS after being threatened with lawsuits. The heart of the question has been whether a sweetener, even one derived from a natural product like corn, can be considered natural if its chemical bonds are altered as part of the manufacturing process. Although there is no formal definition of the term 'natural,' the FDA has a system through which manufacturers can inquire as to whether specific uses of the term would be appropriate. Using this system, FoodNavigator-USA.com submitted a query about the status of HFCS. Office of Nutrition Product Evaluation and Labeling Team Supervisor Geraldine June responded that because HFCS is manufactured using synthetic fixing agents, 'we would object to the use of the term 'natural' on a product containing HFCS.' 'The use of synthetic fixing agents in the enzyme preparation, which is then used to produce HFCS, would not be consistent with our ... policy regarding the use of the term 'natural',' June said. 'Moreover, the corn starch hydrolysate ... used in the production of HFCS, may be obtained through the use of safe and suitable acids or enzymes. Depending on the type of acid(s) used to obtain the corn starch hydrolysate, this substrate itself may not fit within the description of 'natural' and, therefore, HCFS produced from such corn starch hydrolysate would not qualify for a 'natural' labeling term.' While the FDA has yet to respond to two petitions for it to define the term ' natural ,' June told FoodNavigator-USA.com that the agency has other priorities for its limited budget and has no plans to define 'natural' in the near future. In addition, June said, the agency was not sure how concerned consumers were with the issue. Nonetheless, the agency acknowledged in 1993 that '[some] consumers regard many uses of this term as noninformative.' The petitions were submitted by the Sugar Association, which wants a mandate to call sugar a natural sweetener, and baked goods manufacturer Sara Lee, which says that the food industry and consumers need consistency in labeling. At this point, the FDA's only requirement for the natural label is that products so labeled may not contain any artificial flavors, colors or other additives. In addition, no specific ingredient may be labeled with the term, with the exception of 'natural flavors.' But according to a 2006 survey by Harris Interactive, 83 percent of the U.S. public would like to see the government define the term. This may be because more consumers are seeking natural products than ever before; according to a 2004 survey by the Natural Marketing Institute, 63 percent of people in the United States prefer to consume natural food and beverage products. The Mintel Global New Products Database reports that in 2007, 'All Natural' was the third most common claim made on the labels of new food products in the United States and the fourth most common for beverages, with 2,617 and 542 claims respectively. In Europe, 878 new foods and 509 new beverages were launched with 'All Natural' labels that year. Sources for this story include: www.nutraingredients-usa.com . "
0," Many people don't know this, but spirulina is an outstanding dietary aid to help prevent (or reverse) anemia. What follows is a compilation of expert quotations on precisely this topic, cited from some of the most authoritative books and authors in the world. Feel free to cite this information in your own book or website. Be sure to cite the original author and source. An excellent summary study of Spirulina was done in 2002. The authors summarized the many potential benefits of Spirulina: 'Spirulina has been experimentally proven, in vivo and in vitro that it is effective to treat certain allergies, anemia, cancer, hepatotoxicity [toxicity of the liver], viral and cardiovascular diseases, hyperglycemia [high blood sugar], hyperlipidemia [high cholesterol and triglycerides], immunodeficiency, and inflammatory processes, among others. - Spirulina: Nature's superfood by Kelly J Moorhead Unlike other algaes, the cell wall of spirulina has high concentrations of mucopolysaccharides, which are easily digested and form glycoprotein complexes that are important in the formation of protein and the building of cell membranes. Primitive foods such as spirulina contain the highest food energy, the highest nutrient value, and use up the least amount of the planet's resources. Spirulina is also a powerful alkalinizing and healing food. It is an excellent support for the healing of hypoglycemia, diabetes, chronic fatigue, anemia, ulcers, and for boosting the immune system. - Conscious Eating by Gabriel Cousens, M.D. Spirulina and other micro-algae are excellent remedies for most cases of anemia, and B12 is essential for building red blood. Most cases of anemia, however, are not merely a result of B12 deficiency alone; it may be that the massive amounts of chlorophyll, iron, protein, and other nutrients in micro-algae overcome anemia . In our personal experience, we have observed many people who have taken various micro-algae regularly for a decade or more, and when other sources of B12 are included in the diet, B12 deficiency does not arise. - Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition by Paul Pitchford A third of an ounce (10 g) of spirulina powder is enough to cover the daily need for vitamin B12 five times over, four times that for vitamin A, 83 percent of the daily requirement for iron, 30 percent of vitamin B2, and 25 percent of vitamin Bj. Spirulina is particularly recommended for fatigue, anemia, eyesight problems, menstrual problems, and skin disorders. In addition, it helps strengthen the immune system and facilitates the elimination of toxins that have collected inside the body. It comes in the form of a deep-green powder with a faint aroma, and also in tablets or capsules. - Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition by Paul Pitchford It is a rich source of amino acids, chlorophyll, B vitamins, GLA, carotenoids, and other nutrients. Spirulina has been shown to have immune-enhancing effects, it detoxifies heavy metals, and it protects against radiation sickness. A phytonutrient in spirulina known as phycocyanin has been shown to stimulate the production of blood cells. - Prescription for Natural Cures: A Self-Care Guide for Treating Health Problems with Natural Remedies Including Diet and Nutrition, Nutritional Supplements, Bodywork, and More by James F. Balch, M.D. and Mark Stengler, N.D. Hycocyanin, a phytonutrient found in spirulina, has been shown in animal studies to stimulate the bone marrow to produce blood cells more effectively. Spirulina is considered a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Avoid the use of iron sulfate (ferrous sulfate), which is poorly absorbed and can cause digestive upset. - Prescription for Natural Cures: A Self-Care Guide for Treating Health Problems with Natural Remedies Including Diet and Nutrition, Nutritional Supplements, Bodywork, and More by James F. Balch, M.D. and Mark Stengler, N.D. Depression: Wild blue-green excels for lifting bad moods; spirulina, chlorella, and cereal grass are also useful. Anemia: All cereal grasses and green micro-algae discussed in this section are good blood tonics, but spirulina and chlorella are best for building up blood deficiency caused by weak digestive absorption and poor spleen-pancreas function, because these micro-algae are less cooling and cleansing than wild blue-green and wheat or barley grass. - Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition by Paul Pitchford Spirulina is available in powder, capsules, and tablets, and is sometimes found as liquid extracts or flakes. For purposes of prevention, most people benefit from a 'standard' 10-gram dosage: one heaping teaspoon of powder or 5 grams of tablets, twice a day. Double this amount (20 grams/day) is normally an effective upper dosage range for imbalances such as diabetes, hypoglycemia, cataracts, and anemia. More than this, however, is not toxic. Athletes and others with large energy requirements sometimes take 20 grams two or three times a day. - Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition by Paul Pitchford "
0," President Obama loves to tout his 'successful' economic record as one of his most crowning achievements, and indeed, supporters of his administration regularly post memes to social media pointing out how the unemployment rate has fallen, the stock market has risen and how the housing market has recovered during his tenure. But as is always the case when it comes to macro- and micro-economics, the details are much more revealing than hype and political symbolism, and that's where Obama's so-called 'record' of economic achievement falls flat, especially when it comes to American children. In real numbers the president certainly can make the case that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, has risen since he took office (the Dow opened at 8,279.63 on the morning he took office and it closed at 17,631.10 on Tuesday, July 28). But some have argued that's because of the Federal Reserve's zero-interest, easy money policies , not the president's economic policies. Unemployment during Obama's tenure unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, and remained above 9 percent until March 2011; today, the unemployment rate today is about 5.3 percent. But the lowered rate is due to a number of factors, including a record number of Americans no longer being in the labor force , a rise in part-time employment that exceeds pre-Great Recession rates , and the skewed methodology the Labor Department uses to measure unemployment. As for the housing market, it was bottomed out when Obama took office, so really there was nowhere for it to go but up. Kids suffering the most So, what about the most vulnerable in our society - our children? How are they doing under the president's tutelage? Apparently not too well. As reported by USA Today , a higher percentage of American children are living in poverty now than during the Great Recession, says a new report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation [see it here ]. Some 22 percent of kids in the U.S. existed below the official poverty line in 2013, up from 18 percent in 2008, the foundation's Kids Count Data Book noted. In 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services put the official poverty line at $23,624 annually for a family with two adults and two children. 'The fact that it's happening is disturbing on lots of levels,' Laura Speer, the associate director for policy reform and advocacy at the Casey Foundation, a non-profit based in Baltimore, told the paper. 'Those kids often don't have the access to the things they need to thrive.' The organization's mission, according to officials with the group, is to assist low-income children in the United States by providing grants and stumping for policies that foster economic opportunities. As USA Today noted: The report examined data from several federal agencies ranging from 2008 to 2013 to assess state-by-state trends of 16 factors of children's well-being, including economics, education, health and family and community. It found that one in four children - a total of 18.7 million kids - lived in low-income households in 2013; low-income families were defined as those who use more than 30 percent of their pre-tax income for housing. Pattern of national child abuse and neglect But the decline in overall well-being for our nation's children under Obama follows a pattern of abuse and neglect and even murder that has been established over time: -- As we have reported , abortion doctors go 'above and beyond' simply providing women a birth control service by murdering babies born alive. This dovetails with additional reporting regarding revelations that officials from Planned Parenthood have been caught on video negotiating the sale (for profit) of body parts from aborted babies, a federal crime; -- We impose mandatory vaccinations on our children , usurping parental rights to informed consent (or refusal) and enriching Big Pharma even as we expose children to debilitating and deadly vaccine violence ; -- We have permitted state Child Protective Services to be transformed into 'officially sanctioned' entities that engage in child sex trafficking and for-profit operations , under the phony guise of 'protecting' kids; -- We have allowed fast food and sugary drink industries to poison our children with high-fat, low nutrition, genetically modified 'food,' creating a childhood obesity epidemic that has led to the premature development of illnesses like diabetes; -- And we have created a dependency class of citizens, whose children subsist on taxpayer-funded food stamps used to buy low-cost, low nutrition food that enriches big retailers and big banks. So while Obama's economic figures are largely a mirage, what is most definitely real is that the president has done little to improve their lot in America, and lots to make things worse for far too many.

0," Inflammation is characterized as swelling and redness on the skin's surface associated with pain. Inflammation is the body's reaction to threatening or harmful stimuli. On occasion, many people may experience mild inflammation flare-ups due to environmental allergens, micro-organisms or toxins. When flare-ups become more frequent than occasional, a person may be at risk for tissue damage, due to chronic inflammation. To have tissue damage minimized, it is recommended that chronic inflammation sufferers speak to a healthcare professional. Medication is usually prescribed, but there are complimentary or alternative treatments, which include lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as herbal supplements that are known to help inflammation, this includes rheumatoid arthritis. Cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa, Uncaria guianensis) Cat's claw is an herb that is indigenous to Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, and has been an effective natural treatment of certain types of inflammatory conditions. Patients have found relief from gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) and acne, due to skin inflammation, and inflammation due to menstruation. Clinical studies have revealed that cat's claw has shown to greatly improve rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. This popular home remedy used to reduce inflammation is widely available at local health food stores, and it can also be acquired from online herbal retailers Garlic Garlic is rightfully known as one of nature's amazing remedies for a variety of ailments, including preventing blood clots, lowering blood pressure and reducing joint swelling and pain associated with arthritis. By adding more garlic to their diet, many individuals that suffer with joint pain due to inflammation may find relief. Ginger Ginger has many health benefits, including an anti-nausea remedy. It has been noted that ginger is a spice that reduces inflammation, especially in individuals who also have neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis and brain tumors). Guggul (Commiphora wightii) This tree, which is also known as the Mukul myrrh, is native to India, and has been used as a healing herb for generations. It is the resin of the tree that holds the healing power, not the leaves or the bark. The gum, also known as the resin, is collected, and the active healing component is extracted. Traditionally, this herb has been used to remove toxins from the body and has recently caught the attention of modern medical practitioners. Guggul has an active component that has been said to treat a variety of ailments on a molecular, as well as biological, level, according to researchers at the Nationals Institute of Health. Clinical studies and trials have validated that the isolated ingredient guggulsterone is safe to use as a medical remedy, to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Tropical rose mallow (Hibiscus vitifolius) Tropical rose mallow has been studied and has had the attention of modern scientists for centuries. Gossypin, the active ingredient that is found in the root of this plant, is said to significantly reduce fluid retention and inflammation in patients. When compared to phenylbutazone (a synthetic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), gossypin showed results of being much safer and just slightly less effective.

0," You may not be aware of it, but every time you bite into that crisp, organic apple or succulent, organic pear, you could be exposing yourself to two different antibiotic drugs that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) has quietly allowed to be used on these two fruits since the organic program's inception back in the 1990s. And unless the health-conscious community makes its collective voice heard on this important issue, the deceptive practice will continue to play a role in the growing antibiotic-resistance epidemic that is sweeping modern society. It has been a problem since the early days of the National Organic Program (NOP) -- a destructive bacterial disease known as fire blight tends to harm many apple and pear varieties, making their trees appear as though they have been burned by fire. If left to run its natural course without effective intervention, fire blight can kill blossoms, shoots, limbs, and sometimes entire trees, making it difficult to effectively grow certain fruits for commercial distribution. Originally, the argument held that there was no other effective way to cultivate apples and pears, either conventional or organic, without the use of both streptomycin and tetracycline, two antibiotics that are also widely used in the treatment of human pathogens. But since it has become clear that antibiotic-overuse is responsible for causing widespread resistance, and the fact that antibiotic use is inconsistent with the organic philosophy, NOSB decided in 2011 to require that both streptomycin and tetracycline be phased out of use by October 14, 2014. Organic apples and pears grown in the U.S. for the European Union (EU) market are already effectively grown without the use of either streptomycin and tetracycline -- EU provisions do not allow the use of any antibiotics in agriculture -- which means there is no valid reason why these same fruits cannot be grown without the two antibiotics for the American market as well. But heavy influence from some large organic apple and pear growers threatens to postpone NOSB's phase-out requirements until 2016, which threatens both the viability of antibiotics and the safety of the public. 'Every time you eat an organic apple or pear, you expose your gut flora to measurable levels of streptomycin and tetracycline,' explains the Organic Consumers Association (OCA). 'This increases your chances of developing resistance to these important antibiotics, both of which are essential to treating human disease.' Tell NOSB not to cave to corporate pressures -- sign the petition and comment before April 8! OCA has put together a petition urging NOSB to stick to its original plan outlawing the use of both streptomycin and tetracycline by October 21, 2014. The consumer advocacy group is urging supporters to sign the petition and leave comments before April 8, when they will all be delivered to NOSB for consideration. You can access the petition here: http://salsa3.salsalabs.com 'Resistant genes already exist for tetracycline and streptomycin,' adds OCA. 'Every time they are used, resistance is increased by killing bacteria susceptible to the antibiotics and leaving the others. Once resistant genes are present in any bacteria, they increase the pool of resistant genes and the likelihood that human pathogens will acquire that resistance.' Also, if you live in the Portland, Oregon area and would like to attend an April 9-11 meeting with NOSB where you can share your comments and concerns in person, you can sign up here before March 19 : http://salsa3.salsalabs.com "
0," Forest Pharmaceuticals is under fire for causing fatal birth defects with its antidepressant drugs Lexapro [S-(+)-1-[3-(dimethyl-amino) propyl]-1-(p-fluorophenyl)-5-phthalancarbonitrile oxalate] and Celexa [-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile] . As the gavel falls and the lawsuit nears, the company is currently being bought off by another pharmaceutical giant called Avartis. Will they be held liable? The effect of SSRIs on the human brain Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Lexapro and Celexa are drugs that manipulate serotonin levels in the brain, affecting neurotransmitter levels. This changes the way the nerves in the brain send messages to each other, effectively detaching a user's nervous system from reality. These drugs stop the natural process of serotonin reuptake, which occurs when neurotransmitters are taken up by the same nerves that released them. SSRIs work by stopping this natural process in the brain, allowing more serotonin to be available for taken up by other nerves. This brain chemical manipulation process is entirely new to humankind, and the normal function of the brain. With multiple SSRIs now on the market providing an economic boom, psychiatry has become a giant, profit-driven mind experiment gone berserk. If SSRIs were a sustainable, healing strategy, then there wouldn't be such an influx of this kind of drug, they wouldn't be such a big money maker year after year, and they wouldn't have such heinous side effects. Some of the known side effects of these drugs, Lexapro and Celexa, include suicidal behavior. This has been trial-tested in comparison to controls, over and over again. The increased risk of suicide should make any moral doctor object to prescribing these drugs. Sadly though, SSRIs like Lexapro and Celexa are prescribed en masse each year, creating a grand illusion of happiness. Artificially manipulating neurotransmitter levels causes unintended consequences like violent urges or suppressed thoughts. According to a new lawsuit , the drugs can affect newborns in deadly and deforming ways. Forest Pharmaceuticals faces lawsuit for antidepressants that allegedly caused fatal birth defects. The maker of Lexapro and Celexa, Forest Pharmaceuticals, is facing a new lawsuit, alleging that their popular SSRI prescription caused a baby to be born with fatal cardiac birth defects. The plaintiff, Erica Atkinson, was prescribed the two drugs during her pregnancy in 2010 through 2011. When her daughter was born in Indiana on July 14, 2011, there were immediate medical concerns. Her daughter, Sophia Cowan, was born with atrioventricular canal defects. Just three weeks later, on August 7, Sophia passed away due to the complications. The disheartened mother filed suit last year against the New Jersey-based manufacturer of the drugs, Forest Research Institute Inc., claiming negligence, fraud and wrongful death. U.S. District Judge Robert Kugler rejected the claim that New Jersey law applies, saying, 'Here, not only did plaintiffs' injuries occur in Indiana, but 'the conduct causing injury in a prescription drug products liability case, including failure to warn and warranty cases, occurs primarily where the injured party was prescribed and ingested the drug.' Kugler also wrote that Atkinson only summoned Forest Research Institute Inc. and 'did not include summonses for Forest Laboratories Inc. or Forest Pharmaceuticals Inc.' The timeliness of the lawsuit was also questioned. The lawsuit was filed nearly two years after Sophia's death. However, Kugler did say, 'Plaintiffs allege that defendants fraudulently concealed the true risks associated with Lexapro and Celexa and that plaintiffs were prevented from discovering information about the safety of these drugs sooner due to defendants' fraudulent concealment of the facts and information that would have allowed plaintiffs to timely discover potential causes of action.' In the wake of the suit, Forest Laboratories is being bought out Interestingly, Forest Laboratories is currently being bought up by Actavis for about $28 billion. The acquisition will help the pharmaceutical giant convert from generic to brand name and boost its anticipated yearly revenue by billions. As the company dissolves and switches hands, who will be held liable for the fatal birth defects? Why do pharmaceutical companies continue to get away with hurting and killing people all in the name of medicine? "
0," Heart disease and stroke continues to rank as the leading, preventable cause of death in most Western societies, killing three-quarters of a million people combined. Any natural compound that can significantly lower the death rate from vascular diseases should be embraced by natural health advocates and the medical profession alike. Yet allopathic physicians continue to prescribe a host of ineffective and dangerous prescription medications that do little to combat this epidemic. The result of a study published in the British Medical Journal shows that dark chocolate consumption can reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with metabolic syndrome (physical biomarkers that significantly increase the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes). Past studies have suggested that eating small amounts of dark chocolate (containing at least 60 percent cocoa solids) provides short-term heart protective effects. Australian researchers wanted to further determine if dark chocolate could provide long term benefits in an at-risk population. Dark chocolate found to significantly lower non-fatal and fatal vascular events Scientists assembled a cohort of 2,013 participants with existing markers for heart disease (high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome), but were not presently on medications. The group ate dark chocolate daily (equivalent to one ounce or one square of chocolate) for a period of ten years. The investigators used sophisticated risk-prediction algorithms and population life tables to determine the probability of patients developing or dying from heart disease or other non-cardiovascular causes each year. The study demonstrated that those individuals following the dietary chocolate protocol with 100 percent compliance could potentially avert 70 non-fatal and 15 fatal cardiovascular events per 10,000 people treated over 10 years. It is important to note that these risk reduction numbers are higher than many deadly pharmaceutical interventions. At a reduced compliance rate of 80 percent, the scientists found the number of non-fatal and fatal events potentially averted was 55 and 10 per 10,000 people treated over 10 years, still considered to be an effective intervention strategy. The study team noted that the findings are only relevant when consuming dark chocolate with a minimum cocoa content between 60 to 70 percent (prior studies suggest eighty percent cocoa content). Milk chocolate consumption does not lower risk of stroke or heart disease due to the high sugar content and lack of healthy cocoa flavonoids. The researchers concluded that daily dark chocolate consumption 'could represent an effective and cost effective strategy for people with metabolic syndrome (and no diabetes).' Health-minded individuals, especially those at risk or with a familial history of vascular disease may want to consider eating one ounce of high-cocoa content dark chocolate each day to shield against stroke and cardiovascular disease.

0," Populations of Antarctic phytoplankton have dropped significantly due to global warming, threatening the entire chain of ocean life, according to a study conducted by researchers from Rutgers University and published in the journal Science . Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that form the bottom of the oceanic food chain; they are fed upon by krill, which are eaten by whales and small fish. Small fish are then eaten by larger animals all the way up the chain to Adelie penguins and other macrofauna. Because phytoplankton, like other plants, produce chlorophyll in order to photosynthesize energy from sunlight, researchers used measures of chlorophyll off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula to estimate levels of the microorganisms. They then compared these with satellite data over the last 30 years to examine the effects of global warming on plankton populations. The Antarctic Peninsula juts out from the continent toward South America. The rate of winter warming on the peninsula is higher than anywhere else on the planet. The researchers found that overall populations of phytoplankton off the west coast of the peninsula have dropped by 12 percent over the last 30 years. Looking more specifically at regional changes, the researchers were able to see that plankton populations have actually increased in the south, but have decreased by a greater amount in the north. In the south, decreasing cloud cover due to changing climate patterns has increased the sunlight available for the phytoplankton . 'You have more open water and so you have light penetration, so the phytoplankton is happy in the south,' researcher Martin Montes-Hugo said, In the north, however, greater cloud cover and increasing winds are reducing sunlight and driving plankton deeper underwater. 'This makes phytoplankton mad,' Montes-Hugo said. 'It's not good for phytoplankton because you have less light .' In addition to forming the base of the food chain, phytoplankton also absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and emit large quantities of oxygen. Lower levels of plankton means more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and faster global warming -- leading to still lower plankton populations and successively more warming.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Fountain of Youth Summit, which can be found at ( http://fountainofyouthworldsummit.com ) . In this excerpt, Dr. Michael Breus shares on reality of sleep and sleep disorders. The Fountain of Youth World Summit with Dr. Michael Breus, the author of Good Night and Web MD's sleep expert. Kevin: I think it's going to be an awesome talk. And as many people out there know already, I like to get right into it. So let's start talking about sleep. I know you have some facts and you have some numbers. Let's start talking about them. Dr. Breus: Oh yeah. Let's get right into it. One of the things that's really pretty fascinating, Kevin, is just how many people are reporting any symptom of a sleep problem. If you look back at the National Sleep Foundation data from 2000, you'll see that roughly sixty-two percent of the overall population was reporting a problem. But now in 2005, this is still data that's two years old, we're seeing that almost seventy-five percent of people are reporting a type of a sleep problem. Kevin: Wow! So it's a thirteen percent increase. Dr. Breus: Yeah. It's truly amazing. Right now, we're thinking that more than seventy million Americans are suffering from known sleep disorders. Almost fifty percent of people snore. The thing to remember here is snoring is not necessarily a sleep disorder, but it can be a sign or symptom of a sleep disorder called Sleep Apnea. Kevin: Um Hmm Dr. Breus: Unfortunately, the medical community classifies snoring as more of a social nuisance in terms of keeping other people awake. Here's another fascinating statistic -- individuals who sleep with somebody who snores lose on average about one hour of sleep per night. Kevin: Wow! That's incredible! [Laughs] Dr. Breus: So it might not even be your sleep problem that's keeping you from getting a good night's rest. It could be your bed partner's. Kevin: Wow. Dr. Breus: Sleep deprivation affects things like creativity, productivity, memory, relationships and even sexual activity. So there almost isn't an area that sleep doesn't affect. Interestingly enough, it affects every single organ system available. And here's the thing that was kind of baffling to me when I first started getting into this field -- I don't know if you know this, but there are eighty-eight different sleep disorders . Kevin: No kidding! Dr. Breus: Yeah. You wouldn't think that there would be so many. I mean you'd figure 'Well, you know, I close my eyes, I go to sleep, how many things could go wrong?' Well, the truth of the matter is, there are literally eighty-eight different types of sleep disorders . Now some of them can be long-term, they have specific categories. And there are really four or five main sleep disorders that I [haven't seen to] to deal with them. I practice and also talk about them in my book. And those who fall into the category of insomnia, which could be 'having a problem falling asleep' or 'having a problem staying asleep' or either 'waking too early'. There's also a new category of insomnia that we should talk about just for a brief moment, which is called, it's not really called insufficient sleep, it's basically called 'poor quality sleep'. Kevin: Okay. Dr. Breus: And so it's not about the number of minutes that you get but the quality of those minutes. So what's interesting here is that some people might sleep eight hours but they wake up, and they feel horrible. Kevin: Right. Dr. Breus: That's a whole new phenomena that we're just starting to learn more about and trying to investigate more about. Kevin: Anything about the factors? What are some of the factors about? Dr. Breus: Well, you know what? That's a good question as there could be multiple factors. It could be anything from stress, to caffeine, to other medical problems, to even medications or supplements that you could be taking that could be affecting your sleep. Kevin: Mm Hmm. Dr. Breus: So that's a lot of different things that could affect your sleep. The thing that people don't realize is -- I'm kind of like, sort of an internal medicine doctor but, for the night time, if you will, simply because every single area, every single thing you do can have a potential affect on your sleep. Now that doesn't mean that I want everybody to lock themselves in the room. Kevin: [laughs] Dr. Breus: You know, never drink coffee again... Kevin: [laughs] Dr. Breus: [Have a glass of wine] or anything like that, because that's just not me, number one. Number two is that's just not realistic. What I'm hoping to do today with this talk is to let people know, first of all, that this is a serious situation. Second, that there are a lot of different things that we'll be able to do. Very quickly, here even today, even notes that you'd be able to take today during this teleconference, this will help you to sleep better tonight. And they're very realistic, and they're not, [say], going to change your life forever. Kevin: Well, that's fantastic. I must get into that. [Laughs] Dr. Breus: Absolutely. Some people like to know what are some of these big problems that everybody's talking about. So, first of all, about fifty-three percent of people say that they often wake up not feeling refreshed. Thirty-six percent of people say they have trouble falling back to sleep. And then just thirty-one percent of people say they just can't fall asleep in general, [just] insomnia, is what we call it. Again, kind of interesting but more often than not, people are saying it's not the falling asleep, even though a third of people have a problem with that, it's the staying asleep. Kevin: Okay. Dr. Breus: That seems to really get to them. Kevin: Okay. Dr. Breus: Now, the other thing that's kind of fascinating is looking at who has these problems. Believe it or not, women have a tendency to report sleep problems more than men do. Now, I think there are a couple of different reasons for that. One of the different reasons I feel is that women, first of all, they have a reasonably better 'in touch' sense with their body. They know and understand their body. They listen to their bodies, but they also have a greater likelihood to talk about these issues. Kevin: Sure. Dr. Breus: Not necessarily just with their friends, but also with their physicians, their therapists, whoever happens to be speaking with them. And so, interestingly enough, eighty-three percent of the people who are talking about these are women. Kevin: Guys are just like 'I'm okay'. [Laughs] Dr. Breus: Right, it's kind of like this bravado 'Hey, I don't have any problems. All I need is five hours of sleep. Rrrr'. Kevin: [Laughs] Dr. Breus: You know. And the truth of the matter is, that's just not the case. You know, I was with executives from Fortune 100 to Fortune 500 companies all over the world. And, you know, men, women, doesn't really matter. What I find is men come in and they say 'You know, I'm tough, blah blah blah. But when you get them into a room and you talk to them, they're in trouble. They're having a really tough time because they're not eating right, they're not exercising while they're on the road, and they're certainly not sleeping right. And that's affecting their performance not only at work, but at home. Kevin: Right. Dr. Breus: And that's a big deal. And we're also seeing, interestingly enough, there's sort of a bimodal distribution where we're seeing a lot of people between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four having sleep problems. But then also in my practice, I'm seeing people who are in the forty-five and up range having sleep problems as well. So it really seems to be the two distributions which probably speak to the fact that there are two different types of sleep problems that are probably available in those groups. Kevin: What do you speculate those to be? Dr. Breus: I think the speculations would probably fall that the younger group... we're going to see more people with insomnia type problems? Kevin: Okay. Dr. Breus: And what I call disordered sleep. Kevin: Okay. Dr. Breus: See, there's a big difference between a sleep disorder which is a form of diagnosis like insomnia or [apnea] or [narcolepsy] and what I call disordered sleep, which is just wake up and 'I don't feel so hot'. Kevin: Right. Dr. Breus: I think insomnia and the disordered sleep fall in the eighteen to thirty-four age group range. When you start to get above forty-five, I think that's where we start to see a greater preponderance of sleep apnea. Kevin: Mm Hmm. Dr. Breus: Most of us seem to go throughout any particular age range but restless life syndrome pops up huge in the older population. Kevin: Okay. Is sleep apnea due to being overweight or obese? Dr. Breus: Well, here's the interesting thing -- there are multiple factors for sleep apnea. Let's just go into, real quickly, what is sleep apnea. Kevin: Mm Hmm. Dr. Breus: Sleep apnea is where you stop breathing in your sleep. Okay. Generally speaking I like my patients to breathe... Kevin: [Laughs] Dr. Breus: Okay, and so it's good when they keep breathing all night long. Now the truth of the matter is this -- you won't stop breathing in your sleep and not start back, okay. I had a funny time. I was sitting with a patient. I'm explaining her results, studying with her. And I sat down with her and I said 'You know, Mrs XYZ, I want to let you know that you stopped breathing in your sleep over two hundred times last night'. Kevin: Wow! Dr. Breus: You know what she said to me? 'Did I start back up?' Kevin: [Laughs] Dr. Breus: Now that's pretty classic. But that's the level of education that we have to get to here in teaching people what's going on. So the answer is -- yes, she did start back up. And would you believe me if I told you that her sleep apnea was only moderate, and she stopped breathing over two hundred times a night?

0," Top lawmakers on Capitol Hill are negotiating a secret deal to exempt themselves from Obamacare. The Obamacare mandate is a total nightmare, of course, and it doubles health insurance rates while providing nothing resembling actual 'health' care. It's such a nightmare that the very people who passed it now want to exempt themselves from it. That would leave it in a state where only the constituents are subjected to its onerous costs and mandates, not the lawmakers who passed it into law. How's that for hypocrisy in America? According to a report from Politico , 'Congressional leaders in both parties are engaged in high-level, confidential talks about exempting lawmakers and Capitol Hill aides from the insurance exchanges they are mandated to join as part of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, sources in both parties said.' Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell has the best reply to all this: 'Let's exempt the entire country from Obamacare,' he said according to a Breitbart.com report . I couldn't agree more. If Obamacare is so great, why do lawmakers want nothing to do with it? And if they want to be exempted from it, how can they demand that all their constituents be forced to buy it? Even Obama doesn't have to buy Obamacare , it turns out. And the very fact that Obamacare forces citizens to purchase a private insurance product or be fined by the IRS is blatantly unconstitutional and an outlandish interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Obamacare is the biggest government boondoggle our nation has ever seen, and it is doomed to crash and burn. Nobody who understands it wants it, and even those who foolishly were mind-tricked into supporting it have no clue just how badly it's going to hurt them. Every rational person wants to be exempted from Obamacare. Any lawmakers who continue to defend Obamacare will likely find themselves out of a job when the 2014 elections come around. "
0," Just in case you needed yet another reason to stay away from added dietary sugar sources, nutritional scientists now confirm that our obsession with consuming sweets is killing us by dramatically increasing risk of death from cardiovascular disease and heart attack. A host of known risk factors including elevated blood pressure and triglycerides, along with cholesterol abnormalities such as oxidized LDL cholesterol and poor HDL/LDL cholesterol ratios are all attributable to a diet filled with empty calories fueled by sugar consumption. Interestingly, researchers have determined that the increase in cardiovascular risk factors is not attributable to weight gain commonly associated with excess sugar intake; sugar directly raises heart disease risk independent of weight gain. A research study team from New Zealand's University of Otago , publishing in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , has conducted a review and meta-analysis of a large cohort of dietary studies comparing the effects of higher and lower added sugar consumption on blood pressure and lipids, both of which are important cardiovascular risk determinants. Lead study author, Dr. Lisa Te Morenga and her students have uncovered solid and documented evidence that eating sugar has a direct effect on risk factors for heart disease, and is likely to negatively impact blood pressure and blood lipids. Dr. Te Morenga noted, 'Our analysis confirmed that sugars contribute to cardiovascular risk , independent of the effect of sugars on body weight.' Sugar and refined carbohydrates increase risk of hypertension and cholesterol abnormalities The scientists analyzed a total of 49 nutritional intervention trials conducted between 1965 and 2013. Comparing diets where the only intended differences were the amount of sugars and non-sugar carbohydrates consumed by the participants allowed for the measurement of the effects of these diets on lipids and blood pressure . 37 trials reported the effects of dietary sugars on lipid metabolism while another 12 yielded results on blood pressure. The team then pooled the available data to determine the impact on measurable risk factors that affect human health. The team noted that some of the data provided by the studies was skewed as the research was funded by the food/sugar industries. When they factored out those biased results, they found a startling pool of data conclusively demonstrating the negative impact of high-sugar diets on cardio-metabolic risk factors. Small increases in blood pressure, as little as 20 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, can double the risk of a heart attack, while changes to cholesterol metabolism can alter the delicate endothelial lining of the arteries affecting plaque formation and blood clotting. While the food industry and media outlets continue to promote a wide spectrum of processed, sugar packed foods as a means to boost their bottom line profit margins, millions of uninformed people continue to consume 156 pounds of added sugar each year. Recently, sugar has been making news as it has been associated with increased risk of many forms of cancer, as well as stroke and Alzheimer's dementia. The evidence should be clear to any health-minded individual -- eliminate all sources of empty sugar and refined food products in favor of foods in their natural form to dramatically lower the risk of heart disease and most chronic illnesses.

0," Those looking to cash in on the multi-billion-dollar vaccine racket can now do so with the help of a financial reporting company that keeps tabs on the present and expected future growth of the vaccine market for investment purposes. Kind of like playing the craps table in Vegas, gambling on the successes of the vaccine market (and ultimately on children's lives) is the latest money-making scheme in the endless merry-go-round of corporate greed. So while children are becoming permanently injured and dying due to flu shots and MMR vaccines, unscrupulous investors are busy hoping that you and your loved ones won't make too much of a stink about it and cause vaccine industry stock prices to cut into their fiat windfalls. It's just about money, money and more money for these people, as they shamelessly gamble on the collective health of the next generation for their next paycheck. A press release recently issued by PR Newswire explains how the company, Visiongain, provides insights into the forecast sales of vaccines at the world, national, submarket and product levels. Investors can then use this data to play the vaccine market and rake in the big bucks, all on the backs of millions of vaccine-injured children who are being played by the establishment for massive profits. 'Vaccines sector still hold[s] great technological, medical and commercial potential,' announces the press release. '[U]se our predictions for vaccination to expand your business and help your influence... and stay ahead.' Vaccines are just another gambling game at the casino, and your children are the betting chips It's quite sickening if you really think about it -- playing the vaccine industry for cash in the same way you would a slot machine or roulette wheel at Caesar's Palace. If you can accurately calculate the odds and make your bet, then voila, in comes the money. Except slot machines don't cause autism, and the roulette wheel, at least as far as we know, isn't responsible for causing permanent neurological damage. These and other life-changing injuries do result from vaccines , though, which the report likens to 'human medicine.' But who really cares -- it's all about the money, and there's quite a lot of it to be made from vaccines, which are the only products on the market today that are completely shielded from liability and paid for mostly with taxpayer dollars. They're also slowly being forced on the populace without informed consent, which makes vaccines anything but 'human medicine.' Vaccines can more accurately be categorized as weapons of mass destruction, a Trojan Horse protocol of 'medicine' that forever alters the human immune system and leaves it powerless to fight disease naturally and normally. Many of those injected with vaccines develop autoimmune diseases, in which the body attacks itself, thinking it's a foreign invader. This is what vaccines do -- they override natural immunity and bombard the body with all sorts of confusing antibodies and chemicals that often cause permanent, lifelong damage. Based on this model, speculators can also predict how many vaccinated children will require further medical care in the form of pharmaceutical drugs and surgery, another high-profit gambling game that's making a lot of people very, very rich. 'Progress worldwide in vaccines and healthcare will expand vaccination,' adds the press release, illustrating the disgusting return-on-investment approach to pushing the vaccine agenda. '[Y]ou [can] assess developed and developing countries for revenues and potential sales growth.'

0," The Mediterranean Diet has received plenty of praise in recent years for its role in protecting against disease. And two new studies provide further clarity as to why this is the case, having found that the olive oil component of the popular diet helps to not only protect against the damaging effects of environmental pollution but also lower blood pressure in folks who consume it alongside nitrate-rich vegetables. Researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), presenting their findings at the recent American Thoracic Society International Conference, tested the effects of olive oil in mitigating harm caused by air pollution on 42 healthy adults. Each of the adults was given 3 grams of either olive oil or fish oil daily, or neither, for four weeks, followed by exposure to both clean and polluted air. After a month of supplementation with either one of the oils or a placebo, participants were exposed to two hours of filtered air to get baseline readings. The next day, they were exposed to two hours of polluted air. Using an ultrasound, scientists evaluated the participants' blood vessels for any blood vessel narrowing both immediately after and 20 hours after each exposure. They noticed that folks taking the olive oil supplement did not experience any significant narrowing of their blood vessels, which typically occurs as a result of exposure to microscopic particles like the kind emitted from diesel engines. Such hardening can lead to increased blood pressure , a heightened risk of blood clots and other health problems. Those taking the fish oil or placebo, on the other hand, experienced typical blood vessel narrowing, suggesting that olive oil possesses a unique protective benefit. If these results are affirmed through further research, scientists say regular supplementation with olive oil could be a beneficial public health recommendation. 'Our study suggests that use of olive oil supplements may protect against the adverse vascular effects of exposure to air pollution particles,' stated Dr. Haiyan Tong, as quoted by the U.K.'s Telegraph . 'If these results are replicated in further studies, use of these supplements might offer a safe, low cost, and effective means of counteracting some of the health consequences of exposure to air pollution.' Unsaturated fats combine with vegetable-based nitrates to form beneficial 'nitro fatty acids' In a related study, researchers from King's College London noted beneficial effects from consuming olive oil alongside lettuce and other vegetables rich in naturally occurring nitrates. Publishing their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the research observed that the unsaturated fats in olive oil combine with nitrates to form an entirely new compound that helps regulate blood pressure. Based on the research, consuming olive oil daily with foods like spinach, celery and carrots results in the formation of nitro fatty acids that experts say can help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots. In the long term, regular consumption of these foods in conjunction with one another can help reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. 'The findings of our study help to explain why previous research has shown that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular problems like stroke, heart failure and heart attacks,' stated Professor Philip Eaton, a professor of cardiovascular biochemistry at King's and one of the authors of the study. The study was supported by the British Heart Foundation and is among the first to demonstrate how olive oil specifically inhibits an enzyme known as soluble epoxide hydrolase that is responsible for regulating blood pressure.

0," The Obama administration, which regularly touts itself as a champion for minorities, is attempting to cheat thousands of Native Americans out of future compensation that is rightly theirs following a horrendously damaging toxic chemical spill in Colorado recently. The Washington Times reported that tribal leaders say the Obama Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to cheat Navajo Indians by convincing them to sign away rights to future claims following the agency's Gold King Mine disaster. These charges are only magnifying the White House's public relations problems following the toxic spill, which threatens to disrupt critical waterways in the Southwest for many years to come. Within days of the disaster, EPA officials began going door to door asking Navajos some of whom do not speak English as their primary language to sign a form offering to pay them some damages they have incurred from the spill so far. Signing the document waives any rights to return with new claims in the future if costs spiral higher than expected or if they encounter new, currently unforeseen fallout, Navajo President Russell Begaye told The Washington Times . 'It is underhanded. They're just trying to protect their pocketbook,' he told the paper in a telephone interview. Standard federal practice: Cheat those who have been wronged Begaye promised he would file suit on behalf of the Navajo Nation. He also said he suspected that the EPA was attempting to buy off as many of his people as possible now to ward off any larger settlement expenses in the future. As we previously reported , the toxic spill unleashed as much as three million gallons of heavily contaminated yellow-orange water into the Animas River, which feeds into the San Juan River and eventually the Colorado River. The tributaries provide water for cattle and crops in much of the Four Corners area, which is the nexus of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The Navajo Nation encompasses a great deal of that area. While the EPA had not officially responded to a Times inquiry regarding the pending suit, the agency's chief, Gina McCarthy, described the spill as 'heartbreaking' at a press conference in Durango, Colorado. She pledged to work with tribal leaders to control and manage the spill. 'We want everything to be transparent,' she said, despite the fact that the agency grossly underestimated the size of the spill , initially claiming that only about one million gallons of toxic water had escaped through a breached dam. As for the EPA agents trolling the Navajo Nation for early settlements, McCarthy said they were merely following the regular federal claims process, which means that throughout the government, Uncle Sam's standard practice is to shortchange people who have been harmed by careless federal actions. 'May cause forfeiture of your rights' Some lawmakers have pledged to look into the process. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said via a spokeswoman that his office has fielded complaints from Navajo Nation and that his panel plans to look into the entire disaster. 'Chairman Bishop is outraged at the reports that the EPA is asking tribal members to sacrifice their rights after EPA's ineptitude has potentially threatened their health and livelihoods,' spokeswoman Julia Bell Slingsby said. 'People are suffering because of EPA negligence, and yet the federal government's response is not to help, but to engage in grasping for legal cover before the full extent of damage is known to Navajo farmers.' Slingsby added that the EPA would severely punish any private party or corporation that attempted to do the same thing, and she demanded to know why the Department of the Interior which holds oversight over Native American affairs has yet to come to the tribes' aid. The Times further reported: The claim forms EPA officials were distributing on the Navajo reservation ask locals to estimate a dollar amount they can attribute to property damage, personal injury or wrongful death. The form warns that failing to total up the claim 'may cause forfeiture of your rights.' Sources include: WashingtonTimes.com selfnews.com HNGN.com "
0," It is not a survey that bodes well for either the legitimacy of our leaders or, quite possibly, the future of our country. Five years into the 'hope and change' regime of Barack Obama - the American president who promised to deliver us to into the Promised Land - the country is more divided than ever and, what's worse, the highest number of Americans now see big, bloated, all-powerful Uncle Sam as the single biggest threat to their future. That's according to a Dec. 5-8 survey by Gallup: Seventy-two percent of Americans say big government is a greater threat to the U.S. in the future than is big business or big labor, a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. The prior high for big government was 65% in 1999 and 2000. Big government has always topped big business and big labor, including in the initial asking in 1965, but just 35% named it at that time. Steady rise in angst since Obama took office In an era when one side of the political aisle in Washington loves to pit Americans against 'big business,' that more of us are upset at the political system than the preferred whipping boy of 'capitalism' is saying something. Who's responsible? Well, that much is debatable, perhaps, but what is clear is that the rising distrust of government has coincided with President Obama's time in office. Gallup says that since 2009 there has been 'a steady increase in concern about big government.' That concern rose from 55 percent in March of 2009 to 64 percent in November 2011, and from there to its present 72 percent. 'This suggests that government policies specific to the period, such as the Affordable Care Act -- perhaps coupled with recent revelations of government spying tactics by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- may be factors,' says Gallup, in its analysis of the data. Despite attempts to tar and feather - politically - big business, only 21 percent of Americans feel that that is the biggest threat ; 5 percent - a record low - point to big labor. Labor's high point was pretty much the high point of its influence - 29 percent felt that it was the greatest threat to the country in 1965. But since 1995, as big labor's influence (and union membership) has waned, so, too, has its threat factor. No more than 11 percent of Americans since the Clinton era have felt that big labor was the nation's biggest threat. All political persuasions feeling uneasy For big business, its historically high anxiety level among the populace came in 2002, when 38 percent of Americans saw it as a threat. That figure coincided with a series of corporate scandals that had struck major corporations, including the Enron fiasco and Tyco. Also at about that same time, Americans might have been less willing to choose government due to a rally in support for government institutions and officials following the 9/11 attacks. But that euphoria has decidedly dissipated: Americans were also more likely to view big business as a big threat during the recent recession, with more than three in 10 choosing it in 2008 and 2009, a time when many large corporations, including financial and automotive companies, failed or were in danger of failing without government intervention. But fewer Americans now view big business as a threat -- the current 21% is the lowest Gallup has measured since 1983. Perhaps not surprisingly, when Democratic presidents have held office recently, the perception that government is the greatest threat has risen dramatically among Republicans. But the fact that the figure remains as high as it is suggests, clearly, that a sizable portion of Americans from all political walks - Left, Right and Independent - are highly concerned about Uncle Sam's growing power and influence in our lives.

0," Thank you to all those who voted in our selfnews 2016 Presidential poll! Donald Trump easily dominated the top spot, more than doubling the support for our second-place candidate, Rand Paul. Here are the results, followed by some surprising discussion points below: Donald Trump: 44.3% Rand Paul: 18.8% Bernie Sanders: 13.1% Ben Carson: 7.3% Ted Cruz: 7.3% Carly Fiorina: 3.4% No Answer: 2.3% Scott Walker: 1.5% Hillary Clinton: 1.5% Jeb Bush: 0.6% (These votes total 100.1% due to rounding adjustments.) Pleasantly surprised! What's truly astonishing to me -- and pleasantly surprising -- is that 97.9% of our readers rejected the two establishment candidates : Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Bush got the fewest votes of all: just 0.6%, even losing out to 'no answer' votes! Hillary Clinton received an embarrassing 1.5% of the votes, indicating that selfnews readers are, indeed, well informed on the runaway criminality of the Clinton regime. All the top vote choices for selfnews readers -- Donald Trump, Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders -- are anti-establishment candidates at some level. Rand Paul, for example, openly opposes the totalitarian police state in America, and Bernie Sanders openly opposes the Wall Street bankster criminality that dominates our financial sector. Donald Trump, of course, opposes practically everything in Washington, which is why he's the #1 contender for dismantling our twisted, broken, corrupt system of bad government. (Actually, 'bad government' doesn't even begin to describe it. We're talking about 'CRIMINAL government' here.) As this poll reflects, people in America are sick and tired of the status quo in Washington. They're sick of the corruption, the tyranny, the lies, the pandering, the wasteful spending and the targeting of patriotic Americans by the IRS and other federal agencies. They want REAL change, and Donald Trump is the guy they see as being able to march into Washington and clean house. It's no coincidence that we acquired the domain Trump.news , where you can read real-time breaking news on Donald Trump every hour of the day. See FETCH.news for breaking news on other topics such as Hillary Clinton or the White House . Thank you for participating in our 2016 Presidential candidates survey! We'll re-run this survey in a few months to see where things might have shifted by then. It seems increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be out of the race by that time . By the way, I'm fully aware of the many selfnews readers who say this entire election is a charade, and that the powers that be will never allow Trump to become President because he would tear down too much of the corruption that's keeping all the bureaucrats in power. You may be right about that, but for the moment, I'm willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt and see how this plays out. One thing you might be forgetting on this point, by the way, is that Donald Trump is pro military , and the Pentagon has desperately wanted to replace Obama with someone who actually gives a damn about veterans and national defense.

0," According to a ridiculous new obesity study from the University of Bristol, drinking Diet Coke and other diet drinks is healthier than drinking water ... What? As reported by the Alliance for Natural Health , the lead scientist of the study, Peter Rogers, has stated that, 'the balance of evidence indicates that use of [ low-energy sweeteners ] in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced [energy intake] and [body weight], and possibly also when compared with water.' So, basically, what he is saying is that Diet Coke is better for you than water if you are trying to lose some weight. The study itself was backed by Coca-Cola and Pepsi via the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which actually has representatives from both of the enormous corporations on its Eating Behaviour and Energy Balance Task Force. This means that studies backed by the ILSI are also backed by Coca-Cola and Pepsi so are their findings really reliable? Aspartame is bad for your health It seems that actually the latest Coca-Cola backed study is a complete farce because diet drinks generally contain aspartame . Aspartame acts as a sweetener, and is used in place of sugar or high fructose corn syrup, resulting in the drink containing fewer calories and therefore being labelled 'diet.' Switching to these diet versions of your favorite soda will supposedly help you to shed a few pounds . However, according to Global Healing Center, there are a lot of studies that actually show aspartame can have the opposite effect altogether. Artificial sweeteners do not activate your body's natural production of appetite supressing chemicals meaning that nothing triggers you to stop eating and you actually crave sugar. Craving sugar makes you more likely to be dependent on it gaining weight and potentially developing diabetes. Aside from aspartame's impact on your weight, the artificial sweetener has also been linked to leukemia and other health conditions, according to Live in The Now . It is therefore probably better to stay clear of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners altogether. Coca-Cola is trying to change its image Now that Coca-Cola beverages have widely been recognized as being bad for your health, the company is trying to change the public's perception of its products. In recent years, Coca-Cola launched an annual 'Women's Heart Health' campaign, partnering with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, as well as famous model Heidi Klum, to help raise awareness about heart disease in women. However, the truth is that Coca-Cola's many varieties of soda both diet and standard do nothing good for women in terms of heart health. Meanwhile, the latest study was unmasked by investigative journalists Anahad O'Connor and Candice Choi, as nothing more than a corporation paying front groups and scientists to spin the media and public in order to promote or protect the reputation of their products. According to Hang The Bankers , the latest study claiming that diet drinks are healthier than water is in complete contrast to other 'independent research associating diet drinks with weight gain.' So we probably shouldn't believe the seemingly biased and completely bizarre study that goes entirely against scientific fact, and is backed by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra, an advisor to the National Obesity Forum, said that, 'to suggest that diet drinks are more healthy that [sic] drinking water is laughable unscientific nonsense. ... If you want good science you cannot allow corporate sponsorship of research.'

0," In the decades ahead, will humanity sit and watch, as the biotech industry continues to expand, keeping nature dominated, while decimating all those 'pests' that eat away at corporate profits? How might genetically altered seeds and pesticides push honeybees to total collapse, as vegetables and herbs go without pollination, pushed away into oblivion? One day, real vegetables, herbs and fruits could be pushed into endangerment, becoming some of the most costly food commodities. How will nature fight back as the survival of biodiversity in agriculture sits on the chopping block? America now dominated by genetically modified crops Genetically modified crops like corn, soybeans and cotton now dominate the US -- which has become the hub of biotechnology. As of 2013, nearly 85 percent of America's corn production is genetically engineered, followed by 91 percent of soybeans and 88 percent of cotton. The genetic alterations create a highly profitable and controllable seed. GMO corn can be derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The Bt gene splice helps the corn generate its own poison after it's planted, killing off beetles and other pests who dare take a bite. As time wears on, though, nature begins to fight back as the beetles grow stronger than the toxin. In a new report out of Iowa, biotechnology researchers are concerned about the failure of their profitable GMO crops. The western corn rootworm, which is a beetle larva, has become resistant to two strains of genetically modified corn. Farmers in Iowa are reporting that the beetles have begun a mass takeover of their GMO corn, as the new forms of larvae shrug off the toxins. It didn't take long for nature to begin outsmarting scientists. The problem was first reported back in 2009, when lab workers acknowledged pests' growing resistance to the Cry3Bb1 strain of Bt corn . Soon thereafter, the worms started targeting a second strain of Bt corn, mCry3A, overtaking it. The researchers stated that when, farmers mismanage the seed, it doesn't produce enough of the toxin to kill the rootworms. Natural selection is basically producing a bigger, stronger root worm that can shrug off the Bt corn's toxins. Their newfound strength has allowed the worms to be cross-resistant to even the newer strain of Bt corn. So will scientists be able to keep up with the pests? What are their next moves? How will biotechnology respond? How long might the chess match go on as scientists use toxins and chemicals to fight nature? What type of mutant environment awaits? Biotechnology encourages pesticides that are causing honey bee colony collapse Biotechnology farming methods also welcome mass application of pesticides like neonicotinoids. As these chemicals are doused into the open environment, herbs, butterflies, beetles and bees are ravaged, destroyed. This can be seen through the past decade's honey bee 'colony collapse disorder.' According to TIME , bee colonies have collapsed by 43 percent in the past year alone. Neonicotinoid pesticides basically destroy the nervous system of honey bees. Fields of wildflowers and herbs are replaced by expanding markets of corn and soybeans, leaving nothing but a desert for the bees, as their nutrition sources are depleted. So how will Earth cope in the long run, with pesticides obliterating its balanced ecosystem? It seems that biotechnology may not have the upper hand after all. So how far will biotechnology go to preserve its empire over nature? Will free and healthy people begin to respect biodiversity in nature? Or will agriculture become a dictatorship of sorts, ruled by a few select crops that are engineered by a select elite group operating behind biotechnology corporations? "
0," All aboard the propaganda train with the mainstream media as your conductor. The destination: Fantasyland. Scare reports continue to spill across the web about the Disneyland measles outbreak, urging the public to get vaccinated immediately in order to make it all go away. But this latest psy-op is just another lame attempt to push vaccinations, this time with Mickey Mouse science as backing. One report by a CBS affiliate in Baltimore, Maryland , for instance, attempts to scare people into getting MMR vaccines by claiming that this current outbreak is 'targeting those who haven't been immunized.' It also quotes a doctor from Sinai Hospital who blames the outbreak on 'parents... not getting their children vaccinated.' Another even more outlandish report by The Guardian speciously blames the outbreak on the ominous bogeyman known as 'the anti-vaccination movement,' which it says 'single-handedly revived an entirely preventable disease' -- this is utter nonsense, of course, as there have been many measles outbreaks over the years, a number of which involved mostly vaccinated people. These and other flimsy claims being spewed across the media, fueled mostly by an underlying and tenuous hatred of independent thought (and real, independent science, for that matter), are curious in light of the facts that a) at least eight of the 42 infected people identified so far from Disneyland had already been vaccinated for measles, and b) many previous measles outbreaks, including several that occurred in the early 1980s, have involved only vaccinated individuals. There have been many previous measles outbreaks in fully vaccinated populations As reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a measles outbreak that occurred at a high school in Sangamon County, Illinois, between December 9, 1983, and January 13, 1984, for example, affected 16 students, all of whom were previously vaccinated , according to the agency. Just a few years later, a measles outbreak occurred at another high school where, you guessed it, every single affected student was vaccinated . Since both of these outbreaks defy the official vaccine narrative -- they very clearly illustrate that vaccines don't work, in fact -- the media was completely silent about them. There were no media calls to abolish the entire vaccine program even though vaccinated populations quite obviously spurred these outbreaks. There were no insidious, hyperbolic references to 'the pro-vaccination movement' triggering a resurgence of a disease that could have otherwise been eradicated were it not for the vaccines themselves spreading the disease. No, these outbreak reports were instead buried into the government archives because they inconveniently expose the vaccine program for what it is -- a complete fraud. But now that an outbreak has occurred where some of those affected just so happened to not be vaccinated, the pro-vaccine brigades have been deployed in full force to take down all those monsters out there who would rather protect their children from potential lifelong harm due to vaccines than inject their children on the chance that it might temporarily protect against a generally mild, non-life-threatening health condition. [Editor's note: The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is actually more life-threatening than the disease , according to CDC data.] This knee-jerk reaction by the media also fails to help people actually prevent the measles through lifestyle and diet. Making sure you're vaccinated is more important to the establishment than teaching you how to build up your immune system naturally with things like vitamin D, nutrient-dense 'superfoods,' clean, fluoride-free water, sleep and exercise. Fortunately, most of our readers are smarter than the media and already know that this Disneyland measles scare is more child's cartoon than sound science.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) When most people think of burns, fire and heat usually come to mind. While it is true that heat is the leading cause of tissue damage known as 'burns', such damage can also be caused by sunburn and other radiation, friction, electricity, or chemicals. Most burns other than the most severe ones can be treated safely and effectively with natural home remedies. Burns are characterized by degree, based on the severity of the tissue damage. First-degree burns cause redness and swelling in the epidermis (the outermost layers of skin). Second-degree burns also involve redness and swelling as well as blistering and the damage may extend beneath the epidermis to the deeper layers of skin (the dermis). Third-degree burns destroy the entire depth of skin and usually result in scarring, and the damage may extend to underlying fat, muscle, or bone. The wonderful Aloe Vera plant is a top choice for healing and soothing burns. Since the active ingredient (acemannen) breaks down quickly, fresh inner leaf fillets are much preferred. Fresh Aloe Vera quickly soothes painful burns and often heals even serious burns with little or no scarring. Lavender essential oil is a very effective antiseptic that also reduces pain and promotes rapid healing. In addition, lavender reduces scarring. When lavender oil is applied to a burn very quickly, the burn may heal with no scarring at all. For larger burns, pour lavender oil onto a gauze or cloth and apply to the burn every few hours. A wonderful and widely available household first aid item for healing and soothing burns is diluted vinegar. Cover the burn area with a cloth soaked in diluted vinegar. Refresh the vinegar compress as often as needed, especially if the pain becomes stronger again. Another good household item is honey, especially raw honey, which has wonderful antiseptic and healing properties. Researchers in India found that burns dressed with honey healed faster and with less pain and scarring . The India Yunani Cotton-Ash Paste burn remedy has been used for centuries to treat even severe burns. Take a large piece of cotton wool (or any kind of pure, white cotton fabric) and burn it (perhaps in a metal pot). Use the ash of the burned cotton and mix with olive oil to get a thick paste. Spread this black paste on the burned skin and cover with a cling film. Reportedly, the pain disappears in seconds and even the accompanied shock ameliorates. If the pain comes back again, refresh the poultice and use fresh paste on the wound. Use the paste for a week or so, depending on the severity of the burns. Another age old remedy is potato peels. Potato peels provide moisture and they also have anti-bacterial properties that help in healing. Doctors have found that potato peel bandages work better for minor burns than conventional dressings. An effective home remedy for burns can be made by combining equal portions of barley, turmeric and yogurt. Apply the resulting paste over the affected areas for pain relief and healing. Calendula infused oil or calendula ointment is also a good burn remedy. Vitamins A, C, and E aid in the healing process for burns and other wounds. Zinc can help with healthier skin after the burn as well as quicker recovery time. Last, but far from least, is colloidal silver. Colloidal silver has wonderful antiseptic and healing properties and helps damaged tissue regenerate. Major hospital burn units use colloidal silver bandages and ointments. Severe burns often heal with little or no scarring. Note: In the case of any very severe burn, seek professional medical care immediately.

0," When a New Jersey social worker showed up unexpectedly at the home of Christopher and Nicole Zimmer and demanded entry to question them and their son, Chris, about the boy's homeschooling, the Zimmers weren't sure how to react. When Christopher Zimmer initially called the police to find out what rights he had in such a situation, the police gave him an 'ultimatum' and advised him that the social worker had a right to investigate. Zimmer let the social worker in after she said he had better 'or else.' Over the next two hours, an interrogation ensued in which personal details on a number of subjects were demanded of the boy, including questions about whether or not the parents fought, beat their son, used drugs or owned firearms. The social worker, Michelle Marchese, also demanded to see health records, homeschool curriculum and the places where firearms were stored. After the visit, a dismissive-sounding letter was sent to the parents accusing them of being uncooperative regarding the agency's 'referral process' and informing them that the agency 'will not be providing services to your child and your family at this time.' At this point, the Zimmers, having never asked for the agency's 'services' to begin with, decided that enough was enough. They have now launched a $60 million lawsuit against the agency for an 'unlawful and unconstitutional home intrusion' which trampled on their freedom . State attempts to dismiss lawsuit The state has filed to dismiss the complaint, citing what they claim was Marchese's 'qualified immunity' and right to handle the case in such a manner. The Zimmers' attorney has countered by saying: '...there is a Constitutional Fundamental Right to be free from child abuse investigations where there is 'no reasonable and articulable evidence giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a child has been abused or is in imminent danger of abuse.' ' The case may lead to an interesting legal precedent. For one thing, there is no law in New Jersey requiring homeschoolers to show their curriculum to any agency. It would seem that the Zimmers have a solid case against the state, and it's certainly encouraging to see families standing up to Child Protective Services (CPS). As Christopher Zimmer said: 'We want to change it so that they just can't come pounding on your door and saying, 'If you don't let me in, you know who we are; we're going to take your kid away.' They need to start telling people what their rights are. If they want to act like cops, they can abide by the law like the police.' Homeschooling is not illegal In recent years, CPS officials throughout the country have been abusing their authority in an effort to criminalize homeschooling. There have been numerous cases involving innocent law-abiding families whose lives have been disrupted by CPS raids and harassment merely because they opted to educate their children at home a perfectly legal choice in all 50 states. It's not exactly clear why and how CPS agencies have gradually transformed into strong-arm enforcers of an increasingly questionable and underperforming public education system. These agents' tactics would be considered highly invasive and disproportionate by any objective observer even if homeschooling were illegal. The public school system has grown to become dangerous and problematic in recent years. Homeschooling gives parents a chance to give their children real education in a safe and controlled environment. Those who take on the task of homeschooling should be respected not condemned and given the benefit of the doubt. Yet, CPS agents all over the country are becoming arbiters of education a job they are not only unsuited for, but also unauthorized to perform. Maybe when taxpayers begin having to cough up millions in damages against families like the Zimmers, things will begin to change. Sources: GovernmentSlaves.info WashingtonTimes.com "
0," We live in interesting times. Even as our own civilization hangs on the precipice of financial solvency, the priorities of the uninformed masses as so distorted that many will actually camp out in front of a Best Buy store in order to be the first in line to save $100 on a big-screen TV. In a time when the very problems of society are rooted in over-consumption and too much television , the everyday pleebs place such high importance on expanding the size of their mainstream media hypnosis devices that they will physically fight each other to get one of these TVs at a slightly lower price. Meanwhile, the federal debt has plunged past $15 trillion, the freedoms and liberties upon which America built its economic strength are fast eroding, and the U.S. has practically entered a fighting war with Pakistan ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us... ). Pay no mind to any of that, friends. Wal-Mart has teflon-coated waffle makers on sale for two bucks off! Sleight-of-mind distractions Meanwhile, the 2012 presidential election races are under way, and the mainstream media seems determined to catapult anyone into the White House as long as his name isn't Ron Paul. The last thing the globalist controllers really want is someone who dares to tell the People the truth about topics that matter -- the Federal Reserve, national debt, foreign wars, the Bill of Rights and more. Presidents are supposed to be entertainers and distracters , didn't you know? When a nation's collision with financial reality is all but inescapable, that nation inevitably turns to bread and circuses . And so sleight-of-mind distractions invite the masses to invest their attention in dancing with the stars, lusting after the latest electronics gadgets, and tuning in to staged news footage from the front lines of the fabricated 'war on terror' where U.S. troops are now openly engaged in the planting, harvesting and protecting of the opium trade in Afghanistan. You can talk about anything you want in America, it seems, as long as it's not the Bill of Rights, or buying something with cash, or exercising your Free Speech rights -- because all of those things are now considered signs of being a suspected terrorist . Layers of deceit The most astonishing thing about it all is how many layers of wool have been pulled over the eyes of the American people, most of whom suffer under the illusion that they still live in a 'free' country. Where to begin in educating people about this? First, there's the engineered 'war on terror' which was entirely invented, carried out and sold to the American people as a way to justify more war spending and the stripping away of fundamental human rights. Then there's the economic quackery taking place right under our noses as the Federal Reserve -- a private corporation that answers to no one -- has been quietly and deliberately stealing America's wealth for nearly a hundred years. Following the money is simply too difficult for mainstream Americans, who are unable to grasp how purchasing power is deliberately stolen from them through the dilution of the money supply. You're never supposed to get ahead, don't you know? A common wage earner can no more save money and make it into the ranks of the ultra wealthy than a frog can transform into a magical unicorn. That's because a small percentage of your wealth -- everything you've worked for -- is stolen from you year after year, much like the way in which rain erodes a pile of sand that you might have stacked and shoveled into a mound. The economic deceit is designed to keep you enslaved; to keep you working for the globalist corporations that pocket the profits of your labors -- and usually tax-free! Two examples: Bank of America pays NO taxes ( http://www.thestreet.com/story/11059978/bank... ), and General Motors also runs a sweet offshore tax shelter structure that makes it virtually immune to paying taxes at all: http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/23/news/compani... Meanwhile, YOU are taxed when you earn (payroll taxes, paid by your employer), taxed when you save (capital gains taxes) and taxed when you spend (sales taxes). You're even taxed when you just sit on a pile of money and do nothing (monetary devaluation / price inflation). And remarkably, some of the more ignorant members of society have been out protesting, calling for more taxes on the People as a 'solution' to all this! No, my friends. We do not need more taxes on the People. In fact, let me explain something to you that will absolutely astonish you once you grasp the simple truth of it: The U.S. government needs NO TAX MONEY whatsoever to operate! RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) The myth of government needing tax money How's that? You've all been told the government needs a few trillion dollars a year in tax revenues to build bombs, make roads, pay social security benefits and the like, right? It is the Great Lie of our time. Allow me to explain... The idea that the U.S. government needs us to send it our money is rooted in the false assumption that the government cannot simply create the money it wants to spend. And yet, we all now know that to be false. For example, in October 2008 during the first investment banker crisis, the U.S. government (via the Federal Reserve) simply created nearly $1 trillion and handed that money over to the richest, filthiest banksters on the planet. Here's a partial list of who received the money (and this list isn't even up to date) http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list Where did this money come from? Think about it. Did you send in some cash to help with this bailout? Of course not. The money was created out of thin air by the U.S. Treasury working in conspiracy with the Federal Reserve. And that wasn't even the end of it: Between 2008 and 2011, the U.S. government conspired with the Federal Reserve to create trillions more -- in what can only be called 'counterfeit' money -- and then hand it over to the world's wealthiest corporations, banks and institutions. According to the New York Times, the U.S. government has now committed $12.2 trillion to these institutions: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/02/0... Okay, so where is all this money coming from? Did the U.S. government ask every taxpayer to send in a check to cover this $12 trillion? Nope, because that would have required each American man, woman and child to pay $40,000 just to cover it. That obviously didn't happen, so where did this money come from? The government just CREATED the money out of thin air. There is technically no need for federal income taxes Here's the kicker in all this: The government could be creating money right now to end the entire federal tax system so that no American citizen would ever need to pay tax again. The tax code, after all, was originally created only to tax corporations , not the People. Yet today it's the wealthiest corporations that are paying no tax while the People are being bankrupted by it. So the government, you see, could simply create the few trillion dollars it needs each year to pay for defense spending (bombs and bullets), interest on the debt, social security, Medicare, etc. And that means the government technically doesn't need YOUR tax dollars at all! Now, of course, it would be financial suicide for the government to keep creating trillions of dollars each year, thereby eroding the purchasing power of the dollar and resulting in price inflation across the nation -- but it's doing that anyway! In other words, the government is already CREATING trillions of dollars in new money, year after year, solely for the benefit of the wealthy banksters and global corporate giants. So if the government is already headed into total financial insolvency (runaway debt increases combined with an upcoming currency collapse) -- why not use this suicidal process to help the People for a while instead of just bailing out the wealthy corporations? Imagine this: The IRS announces a cancellation of the personal income tax. You no longer have to file on April 15th. You can keep all the money you've earned, other than state income taxes. Can you imagine the economic boom that would result? People who earn more will spend more, thereby unleashing a domino effect of new job creation across the economy. People would be happier, stress would be lowered, and we would probably see a reduction in heart attacks and suicides, too. The federal government, meanwhile, would simply create a couple of trillion dollars each year to fund its own budgetary needs, and we could all ride this insane financial monster into the ground together while at least avoiding the hassle of filling out a stack of income tax paperwork every April. There's no question, you see, that the U.S. government is headed into total financial insolvency. I'm just saying that as long as we're headed that way, we should be bailing out the People instead of bailing out the rich banksters and wealthy corporations. Why not cancel the income tax next April 15th and announce an income tax bailout for the working people? Don't you see that the bankster bailouts are the most obscene example of crony capitalism? The money goes to the insider pals while the debt burden is heaped upon the working poor. That's the real problem with America -- not capitalism , but criminality! The real purpose of the income tax - it's not what you think So if the tax code is not needed to generate money for the government, what is its purpose, you ask? The purpose of the federal tax code is to keep you down, to keep your face buried in the dirt so that you can never rise up and 'get ahead.' The purpose is not to fund the federal government itself, as you've been told. The government has already proven it can create trillions of dollars when it really wants to . So remember that as you're out spending your after-tax dollars this holiday season. Most of what you have been told by conventional, mainstream sources is pure fabrication: The War on Terror, the 'danger' of marijuana, the 'right' of the government to reach down your pants at the airport, and of course the 'need' for you to 'contribute' to the government to pay for roads and schools. It's all so hilariously fictional that we should all be rolling on the floor laughing about it if we weren't already writhing from the pain of writing all those checks to the government. Taxes, you see, are really just a financial shakedown . They are an exercise of thuggish government power over the common people for no purpose than to remind the People they are slaves to the state. And for that purpose, federal taxes are very, very effective. Much like the fictional War on Terror, the IRS reminds everybody to 'be afraid' and comply. And it works. Even I comply with the federal tax code and dutifully pay what seems to be far too much to the federal government every single year. The difference is that I know it's all a silly game and has nothing whatsoever to do with actually funding government operations. So I pay, and I chuckle, and I continue to work toward the day when we may see the rise of social justice in America where the money supply is honest, the corporations are stripped of their fictional 'rights,' and everyone shares equally in the funding of running a smaller government whose main function is to protect and preserve the rights of the People... not to rule over them like tyrants. Happy Holidays from selfnews. Enjoy your Christmas season, but as you spend money this year, I encourage you to look at that money in an enlightened way and realize the deeper truth of where money comes from, how it is created, and how government use money confiscation (and devaluation) to weaken the economic power of the People while concentrating it in the hands of the few.

0," To the mainstream media, whose editors and reporters are in lockstep with certain political ideologies and social mores, global warming/climate change is an inevitable apocalyptic nightmare looming just over the horizon. This was in evidence again recently, as most media around the country breathlessly reported the details of a just-released UN report that world leaders have just a couple of years left to act to reduce man-made carbon emissions or we're all going to die a horrible, smog-filled death. 'There is potential for crossing a threshold that leads to large system changes, and that's a very unknown world that has severe consequences,' declared Kelly Levin, a scientist who studies climate change impacts at the World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C., regarding the report's findings. So the press, along with government-sponsored scientists who have been funded by taxpayers to conduct climate 'research' that has a pre-ordained outcome, believe that man-caused pollution will destroy Earth. Got it. Though real research has the jury still out on such declarations (that, and the fact that earlier press reports have outed some climate scientists, like those at East Anglia University in Britain, who purposely falsified data in order to make it seem like 'global warming' was real [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk ]), the media largely remain wedded to their version of climate change 'facts.' But what about genuine, provable and well researched findings which conclude that the earth's modern technology could be destroyed by massive electromagnetic storms generated by the sun -- storms that have occurred, on smaller scales, for millions of years? No, that kind of talk is 'apocalyptic' and foolish (if for no other reason than that the press has a real political and ideological problem with one of the people who are trying to warn us about it). Mocking and derision for such a serious, and proven, occurrence It was that kind of mocking tone taken by one writer at National Journal , known as a bastion of Left-liberal thought and political ideology, when it came to 'reporting' on concerns expressed by former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a high-profile team of experts that sun-caused electromagnetic pulse storms could destroy America's -- and the world's -- power grids: Within a year, nine out of 10 Americans could be dead. And whatever causes the national apocalypse--be it North Korean malice or the whims of the sun--the downfall will ultimately be our own fault. That's the fear of Newt Gingrich and other members of a high-profile coalition who are convinced that our fragile electrical grid could be wiped out at any moment. Their concern? Electromagnetic pulses, the short bursts of energy--caused by anything from a nuclear blast to a solar flare--that can wreak havoc on electrical systems on a massive scale. And the coalition believes it's coming soon. Indeed, according to Peter Pry, a former CIA officer and head of a congressional advisory board on national security -- not really the kind of position you get for being an alarmist or a crackpot -- the threat is real enough. 'I think we're running out of time,' Pry says. And if the worst does happen? Calamity -- no, not the 'rise-of-a-few-degrees' kind of 'calamity' (warmer temperatures would actually be good for Mankind, as this Stanford paper argues ) -- but the society-ending kind of calamity. 'This gets translated into mass fatalities, because our modern civilization can't feed, transport, or provide law and order without electricity,' Pry said. As for Gingrich? Pry says he's known about it -- and cared about it -- for years. Indeed, last year Gingrich told members of Congress that an attack using EMP 'could be the kind of catastrophe that ends civilization--and that's not an exaggeration.' And, as Gingrich has argued, an EMP blast would not have to come from a nuclear weapon; it could very well come from a gigantic solar flare that triggers a geomagnetic storm that would wipe out not just America's technology but the world's, throwing the planet back into the 19th century. What's the harm in being prepared? It's happened before, in 1859; known as the Carrington Event, a large flare fried telegraph lines around the globe. And, as Pry notes, such events tend to happen every 150 years or so, meaning the world is currently living on borrowed time. Why mock that? Would a global meltdown of the world's power and technology be a laughing matter? What's more, the solution is simple: surge protectors, in essence -- the same kind we use to protect our PCs, laptops and devices -- only on a larger scale, Gingrich and Co. say. Also, as National Journal reported: The coalition wants such protectors placed across the electrical grid to block harmful currents. In addition, advocates want to protect the extra-high-voltage transformers we depend on with metal, current-absorbing boxes called Faraday cages. And more replacement parts, especially the giant transformers that can take years to make, need to be at the ready in case we lose critical pieces of the grid. That way, even if an EMP damaged key infrastructure elements, the U.S. would have replacements ready to go. As those in the global warming mindset are fond of saying, if no such event happens, what harm would it cause to prepare, considering that the results of not doing so would be, well, catastrophic?

0," We need to hydrate with pure water to retain our physical and mental health. All our tissues' cells need to be hydrated to function properly. Would you believe that most of us are dehydrated? It's not just your five or so quarts of blood serum that contain water. Your organs' cells contain water. Your brain and nerve tissues are 80 percent water. Severe dehydration leads to mental derangement and death. Most of us, perhaps 75% of the population, suffer from mild dehydration, which if chronic leads to poor health, aches and pains, low energy, mental fogginess, and even serious diseases of all types. Pure water helps our bodies detoxify. The water helps separate blood platelets and floods fatty tissues where toxins often accumulate. While undergoing any kind of detox protocol, drinking more pure water is necessary. Caffeinated beverages and alcohol dehydrate. Sodas are poison carriers. Almost all bottled waters are plain tap water leeching petroleum toxins from their containers. How to make sure you're drinking pure water A study of 29 USA cities' water supplies uncovered all sorts of pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides, as well as traces of prescription drugs. Chlorine is bad enough, but much worse are its byproducts, known as disinfection byproducts or DBPs. DBPs are formed when chlorine combines with minerals and heavy metals in tap water. Then there is this stuff called sodium fluoride, you know, to prevent cavities. It is highly toxic in large quantities and continual low dose consumption slowly makes us dumb and sick, and it is added into 70 percent of the USA's municipal water supplies ( http://www.selfnews.com/032129_fluoridation_intelligence.html ). Forget the off the shelf bottled waters. In most of those products you'll have contaminated tap water with leeched plastic petroleum by products and the endocrine mimicker BPA (Biphenol-A) to throw off your sex hormone balance. If you don't have access to real spring water delivered in glass jugs, there are two effective approaches for purifying your drinking water: Reverse osmosis with added charcoal filtering, and Berkey type portable systems originally intended to purify contaminated stagnant water from jungle environments. Water purification expert Robert Slovak, interviewed by Dr. Mercola a few times, recommends reverse osmosis over all other types , including distilled, ionized, or alkalized. He says if you feel the need to make your water more alkaline, add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda. It's cheaper. Distilled water used consistently will leech vital minerals out of your body. But it's a good base for natural medicines or tinctures. Reverse osmosis does remove a good deal of important minerals but they can be restored simply with a few drops of liquid mineral solutions (available at health food stores) and/or pure sea salt. But reverse osmosis, coupled with charcoal filtration is accessible and works to remove almost all chemical contaminants and most of the fluorine. Filters alone don't remove any fluorides. The least expensive reverse osmosis is available at all health food stores and even most non-organic grocery stores for 25 to 50 cents a gallon. Take a moment to examine the diagrammed flow chart on a water dispensing machine. Look for cycles labeled charcoal filtering and reverse osmosis. Bingo, there you have the least expensive effective water purification available to refill your containers. There are household reverse osmosis/charcoal systems that are expensive, and under the sink systems that are considerably less expensive. The major difference is with the household system, you purify bath and shower water. Under the sink will take care of your drinking and cooking water. Yes, cooking water. Boiling does not remove fluorides or heavy metals. Berkey type systems don't require electricity ( http://www.berkeywater.com/start.main.html ). "
0," How could it be that genetically modified foods were never approved by the FDA, yet they infiltrate nearly all staple crops across the USA? For 25 years, Americans have been consuming common foods like corn, soy and canola that contain bacteria from insects and insecticides that kill bugs and worms, without giving it a second thought. It is widespread belief in the United States that the FDA protects the masses with legislation, food inspections and drug testing, but nothing could be further from the truth. According to a research analyst for 'Friends of the Earth,' all GMO crops are simply 'evaluated' by government regulators, and that is the end of the line. These studies are unpublished and conducted by the company that develops each crop. Conflicts of interest are of no concern to the FDA. In fact, no single GMO crop has ever been approved by the FDA. How could this be? From Farm to Death - it's Franken-Corn 863.2 Disturbing summarized results of a 90-day study on insecticide-producing corn called MON863.2 have prompted requests for the release of the full study, which was conducted by the most evil corporation on the planet, Monsanto . Unfortunately for Monsanto, a German court ordered them to release the study, which showed that lab rats fed the corn not only had elevated white blood cell counts but also had lower kidney weights. We now know that genes from genetically modified organisms actually transfer themselves into the bacteria of the human body, including in the mouth and gut. The gene from soy, the Roundup Ready gene , has been found in the human gut and can transfer to a fetus. Genetically Modified Peas, Apples and Oranges The US Government shows no mercy to its citizens regarding toxic food and toxic medicine thanks to continued lobbyist payoffs, bribes and coercion inside of Washington, DC. Politicians appoint former lobbyists and VPs of Monsanto to run the FDA and USDA and even to sit on the Supreme Court . These ultimate conflicts of interest fuel the propaganda which says GMO is safe for human consumption, knowing it is not. Now, even peas, apples and oranges are being modified to contain bacteria that are foreign to the fruits and vegetables. Blights and fungi are being killed with genetically modified ingredients that cause cancer, but Big Food doesn't care. It's all about cutting corners, making more money and yielding more sellable crop. Research has revealed that mice fed GM peas suffer from lung inflammation and elevated serum antibody levels. GM soy causes all kinds of allergic reactions and contains proteins identical to that found in dust mite and shrimp allergens . Go figure! To Biotech, Humans are Lab-Rats Eating Cancer Rat-killing foods are carcinogenic to humans, but the FDA calls them safe because the medical-industrial complex has a stranglehold on all US regulatory agencies. This is nothing new. In fact, the FDA, the AMA (American Medical Association) and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) have been corrupt for 80 years, with crooks and fraudulent researchers faking results of tests, skewing information and spreading propaganda. Remember when they said cigarettes were safe and physician 'tested'? Doctors recommended their favorite brands!

Get the Hidden History of Medicine here: ( http://www.selfnews.com ). See the absurd Camel Cigarette ads where doctors sell you on the safety of cigarettes here: ( http://www.healio.com ). Apply that same lack of logic and ethics to GMO and you'll know where to make YOUR stand. Don't trust the FDA or anything that says 'all natural.' You are being misled, along with millions of innocent people, and you are being driven to consume cancer-causing pesticides. Be smart.

0," The future of food production could end up doing away with the growing fields and even the sun. A Japanese plant physiologist has developed an indoor growing system that he says produces lettuce 250 percent faster than traditional farms, requires far less water and generates significantly less produce waste. Using LED technology developed by the GE corporation, Shigeharu Shimamura was able to create a 25,000 square foot indoor space that currently houses 18 cultivation racks for growing lettuce. These racks are 15 stories high and contain a total of 17,500 LED lights specially designed for the optimal growing of lettuce. The proprietary lighting system mimics the day and night cycle of the real outdoors, but at a highly accelerated pace. Together with carefully controlled climate and moisture conditions, Shimamura and GE were able to fine-tune a complex system that generates large amounts of healthy food very quickly, without producing significant amounts of waste. 'I knew how to grow good vegetables biologically and I wanted to integrate that knowledge with hardware to make things happen,' he explained to GE Reports . Indoor produce farm generating 10,000 heads of lettuce daily Having gotten the idea from a 'vegetable factory' that was featured at the Expo '85 world's fair in Tsukuba when he was just a teenager, Shimamura had ever since been inspired to start his own indoor growing facility. And after the Fukushima disaster of 2011, he finally got his chance. According to GE Reports , Shimamura was able to turn a former Sony Corporation semiconductor factory in eastern Japan's Miyagi Prefecture, which was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami, into the world's largest indoor growing farm. And today, this farm produces an astounding 10,000 heads of lettuce daily, with an average loss of only 10 percent of the harvest. A typical outdoor produce farm, on the other hand, loses up to 50 percent of its harvest, representing a 400 percent reduction in waste. Beyond this, the specialized temperature and humidity conditions inside the farm require just 1 percent of the total amount of water typically required for outdoor growing operations. All these tweaks have created ideal growing conditions that Shimamura says have resulted in a 100-fold increase in productivity. This means 100 times more food can be grown in the relatively small indoor space he created compared to outdoor grow operations, which are still threatened by residual radiation contamination. 'What we need to do is not just [set] up more days and nights,' he stated. 'We want to achieve the best combination of photosynthesis during the day and breathing at night by controlling the lighting and the environment.' Are indoor produce 'farms' the future of food for planet Earth? For GE Japan, the technology offers hope for humanity moving into the future. The drastic improvements in yield and productivity offered by Shimamura's concept stand to address the world's growing food shortage problems, particularly in the face of drought and other similar challenges. Since its LED technology is working so well at maximizing the growth rate of lettuce, this due to its ability to produce light at wavelengths ideal for plant growth, GE Japan is already working on similar growing facilities both in Hong Kong and the Far East of Russia. Together, the duo hopes to bring real change to those in need. 'Finally, we are about to start the real agricultural industrialization,' said Shimamura with confidence. "
0," Nobody likes a toothache, and drug-based solutions like Anbesol and Orajel can cause side effects like gum sensitivity and rectal irritation that make using them for oral health much more troublesome than beneficial, in many cases. But there is a natural solution to the problem that costs pennies on the dollar, and that could provide lasting relief without all the harmful side effects: clove oil. Rich in all-natural eugenol, a powerful antifungal, anesthetic, antibacterial and antiseptic healing compound, clove oil is renowned in traditional medicine as an effective treatment for toothaches. Known in the scientific realm as Eugenia aromaticum , clove oil existed long before drug companies arrived on the scene, and people have been using it to treat oral pain for many centuries. Clove oil is still used today in some toothpastes and mouthwashes, but it has largely been replaced with chemicals that many people are trying to avoid. At the same time, modern science has affirmed that clove oil works the same as, if not better than, chemical-based anesthetics like benzocaine, which can exacerbate respiratory symptoms and lead to a blood disorder known as methemoglobinemia. 'Benzocaine, like many other anesthetics, can cause allergic reactions and other side effects that some people find unpalatable,' writes New York Times columnist Anahad O'Connor in the paper's 'Really?' section, which focuses on the science behind alternative medicine. 'But one natural alternative is clove oil , an essential oil from the clove plant... [that] has been shown in studies to have both analgesic and antibacterial properties.' Study confirms clove oil works just as well as benzocaine at relieving pain Many people unfamiliar with the healing power of natural plants and herbs, including the essential oil of clove, tend to underestimate how well these products work compared to their pharmaceutical counterparts. The assumption is that synthetic drugs somehow work better, and that natural remedies are merely a last resort when nothing else works. But nothing could be further from the truth, as a 2006 study published in the Journal of Dentistry found that clove oil works the same as benzocaine for relieving toothaches and chronic tooth pain. After comparing its effects against both benzocaine and a placebo on 73 adult volunteers, researchers found that clove oil effectively numbs oral tissue without causing side effects. 'No significant difference was observed between clove and benzocaine regarding pain scores,' wrote the authors of this study. Clove oil also rich in vitamins, nutrients The health benefits of clove oil do not stop here, however. As it turns out, clove oil is rich in nutrients like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium, as well as vitamins A, B and C. When taken orally in appropriate amounts, clove oil can help treat the types of health problems caused by benzocaine, including respiratory problems and digestive ailments. 'Traditional Chinese physicians have long used the herb to treat indigestion, diarrhea, hernia, and ringworm, as well as athlete's foot and other fungal infections and as a stimulant for the nerves,' explains Bee Wilder for HealingNaturallyByBee.com . 'India's traditional Ayurvedic healers have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory and digestive ailments.' Clove oil also blends well with the oils of other herbs and foods like cinnamon, nutmeg and orange, which can be used to treat other conditions like cold and flu, whooping cough, depression and even antioxidant deficiency.

0," Tweet There may be a relationship between the process that causes the body to tan and its defenses against skin cancer, according to a study conducted by scientists from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and published in 'Cell.' Tanning has actually been found to prevent cancer tumors. Jump directly to: conventional view | alternative view | resources | bottom line What you need to know - Conventional View Researchers found that when skin is exposed to sunlight, the body releases a protein called p53, a well-known tumor suppressor. A previous study by the same scientists found that when ultraviolet solar radiation strikes the skin, it also triggers the breakdown of the protein POMC, which in turn triggers the release of a hormone that produces melanin and causes the skin to darken (tan). When p53 was injected into skin cells, POMC production increased drastically. This may also explain the development of age spots, which are usually triggered by stress, because the body also produces p53 as a response to stress-induced DNA damage. The scientists also found evidence that p53 may trigger the release of endorphins, which are associated with feelings of pleasure. This may explain the phenomenon of sunshine addiction. Quote: 'The number one risk factor for melanoma is an inability to tan.' - Senior Author David E. Fisher What you need to know - Alternative View Statements and opinions by Mike Adams, author of The Healing Power of Sunlight and Vitamin D The idea that sunlight exposure causes skin cancer is a persistent medical myth. What we now know is that ultraviolet radiation only promotes sunburns and DNA damage when a person is chronically deficient in antioxidant nutrition. Building up a tan and boosting your intake of antioxidants from berries and superfoods is the best way to prevent sunburn and skin cancer . The skin cancer industry is largely bankrolled by sunscreen manufacturers who hope to de-educate people about the healing power of sunlight and scare consumers into buying more sunscreen.

0," If you plan on going to a teaching hospital for a test or elective procedure, here's a warning that could save your life: Stay away from the hospital in July. The reason? According to a new study headed by Dr. David Phillips and Gwendolyn Barker from the University of California, San Diego, fatal medication errors soar that month -- especially in teaching hospitals. The research team investigated the cause behind the so-called curious 'July Effect' that has long been noted to worsen the outcomes of patients being treated in teaching hospitals during the month of July. Phillips and Barker focused on 244,388 U.S. death certificates issued between 1979 and 2006 that listed fatal medication errors as the primary cause of death. Then they compared the number of deaths that occurred in July with the number of expected events in a given month for a given year. Next, they looked to see if there were any differences between deaths in and out of hospitals in July and in counties that had or lacked teaching hospitals. The research, which was just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , found a clear association between inexperienced physicians and deadly medical errors. Specifically, the spike in hospital deaths each year from medication mistakes (such as accidental overdoses, wrong drugs given, and accidents in the use of drugs during medical and surgical procedures) in July coincided exactly with the annual influx of thousands of rookie doctors who begin their medical residencies and take on responsibility for patient care that month. This July peak in fatal drug errors was seen only in counties with teaching hospitals. In fact, the greater the concentration of teaching hospitals in a region, the greater the July spike in deaths. This was no little insignificant blip in the number of fatal physician screw-ups, either. The number of July deaths from medication mistakes linked to new doctors was a full 10 percent higher than the expected level. 'Our findings provide fresh evidence for 1. re-evaluating responsibilities assigned to new residents; 2. increasing supervision of new residents; 3. increasing education concerned with medication safety,' the authors of the study concluded. 'Incorporating these changes might reduce both fatal and non-fatal medication errors and thereby reduce the substantial costs associated with these errors.'

0," If you ever needed more proof that liberals and progressives are economic illiterates, this should do it for you. As noted over at Zero Hedge , insanely liberal web site Salon.com 'took a quick break from criticizing a caricature of libertarianism' to allow one of its writers, David Sirota, to tap out a rather embarrassing piece that praised socialism in 2013. It turned out 'to be a fantastic case study in both the dangers of socialist economics and of course, speaking too soon,' Zero Hedge's Tyler Durden posted. Titled ' Hugo Chavez's Economic Miracle ,' Sirota's piece was not the only dream piece pertaining to the subject of how much more wonderful socialism is than evil American-style free-marketism (which we haven't really had in a hundred years, ever since progressives began regulating American industry). As Durden noted, such 20/20 hindsight vision does serve a useful purpose. When you look at Venezuela now, it is an economic basket case ; past is prologue. The Chavez economic model was predictable. In many ways, the lure of socialism is that it 'appears' to produce quick results. However, such policies really just serve as a good example of what Nicolas Cachanosky calls ' the bait-and-switch behind economic populism .' This principle is defined as government policies focused principally on consumption but little on investment; they always give off good economic signs initially but are followed by economic collapse and disaster. Inflation, falling revenue and tight monetary controls equals a socialist economic nightmare Durden notes: Sirota's article at least begins by lamenting Chavez's rather poor record on civil rights (like shutting down a TV station that was critical of him) and noting 'a boom in violent crime.' This may somehow be an understatement as Venezuela ranks second in the world in murders per capita at a terrifying rate of 53.7 per 100,000 citizens annually! (So much for socialism alleviating crime.) He finally does arrive at his case for this 'economic miracle' that Venezuela was experiencing under Chavez (which, I should note, makes up only one paragraph of his entire article). How much of the country's economic 'success' can be attributed to its oil production is a subject of debate. However, it's also worth noting that the positive trends Sirota cited were common throughout Latin America , Durden noted, and that included Colombia, which has moved in the opposite direction economically. The World Bank reports that between 2005 and 2013, Colombia's poverty rate fell from 45 percent to 30.6 percent, while Peru's plunged from 55.6 percent to 23.9 percent, Uruguay's dropped from 32. 5 percent to 11.5 percent, and Ecuador's fell from 42.2 percent to 25.6 percent. Venezuela's rate fell about the same, making it average. Moreover, this plunge took place prior to the country's current economic woes. Granted, the decline in oil prices has hurt Venezuela, but the country's economic problems were beginning to become apparent prior to oil's decline. In October 2014, Zero Hedge reports, the country ran a 17 percent budget deficit while dealing with significant product shortages. Indeed, every major oil exporter has been harmed economically by lower prices, but overall they are weathering the losses much better than Venezuela. Will Salon print a follow-up? In fact, economists say that the drop in oil prices merely exacerbated problems caused by the extremist populist/socialist policies begun by Chavez and maintained by his successor, Nicolas Maduro. Now, the country faces an astounding 64 percent inflation rate ; the South American country with the second-highest rate is Argentina with just 10.9 percent. The Telegraph noted in February that Venezuela's economy will have contracted by 7 percent this year, mostly on declining oil revenues, but that exposes the fallacy of socialism, which requires an ever-growing (or at least a sustained) government income in order to maintain. Durden notes that the entire experiment of socialism in Venezuela and beyond is a one-trick pony that delivers early but fades over the mid-to-long term, ending badly for the population. Look at Cuba; socialism there has never produced a viable economy. Like him, we'll wait and see if Salon will attempt a follow-up.

0," Tweet A link may exist between the development of pituitary tumors and the use of some drugs commonly used to treat schizophrenia, according to research from Duke University Medical Center and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although a connection has been suspected for more than 20 years, this is the first systematic study to document an association between specific antipsychotic medications and adverse reports of pituitary tumors in humans. Of seven antipsychotic medications, risperidone (trade name Risperdal), was linked to 70 percent of pituitary tumors reported to the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System database. Risperidone is the most widely used medication within the class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which are used to treat schizophrenia, paranoia and manic-depressive disorders, according to the study authors. The findings appear in the June 2, 2006 issue of Pharmacotherapy. The study was funded by the author's respective research departments. Coauthors include lead author Ana Szarfman, Joseph Tonning and Jonathan Levine, all of the FDA. The researchers cautioned that the study, although suggestive, does not prove that the medications actually cause pituitary tumors. 'Our findings do not prove a causal relationship between antipsychotic medications and pituitary tumors, but health professionals and patients should be aware of such potentially adverse effects,' said P. Murali Doraiswamy, M.D., a psychiatrist at Duke and co-author of the study. 'Atypical antipsychotics are lifesaving medications for a lot of people. By no means are we advocating that people stop using them, especially risperidone,' he said. 'But we do need to learn more about possible differences in their long-term side-effects, and I believe this should be a high priority for investigation.' Doraiswamy cautions that the study merely suggests an association between the drugs, pituitary tumors and several other side-effects not a true causal relationship. Further studies are needed to offer such conclusive evidence. If future studies confirm the findings, stronger warning labels should be considered for these drugs, he said. 'The actual numbers of people known to have developed pituitary tumors as a possible side-effect due to any of these medications remains unclear because many adverse drug reactions are not reported to the FDA,' Doraiswamy cautioned. 'We also don't have exact numbers of how many people currently take these drugs. Another caveat is that pituitary tumors can occur incidentally among the population in general.' The team chose six atypical antipsychotics and one typical antipsychotic to examine in a 'data mining' analysis using a sophisticated software algorithm. The algorithm, called the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), was used to 'mine' data contained in the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Using the algorithm software, the researchers looked for disproportionate reporting patterns of pituitary tumors linked to use of risperidone, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and haloperidol, the typical antipsychotic. They found 77 reports of pituitary tumors associated with the seven antipsychotics. Risperidone was associated with 54 (70 percent) of those reports and had the highest adjusted reporting ratio for pituitary tumors, followed by haloperidol and ziprasidone. Complications included nine reports of visual problems, two reports of convulsions, four reports of headaches, three reports of cerebrovascular events and seven reports of patients who needed surgical intervention. The antipsychotic drugs in question are all dopamine D2 receptor antagonists that work by blocking dopamine, a neurotransmitter. A key function of dopamine is to suppress the release of prolactin, a hormone, from the pituitary gland. Elevation of blood prolactin levels is a well known side-effect of potent dopamine D2 blocking antipsychotics and, because antipsychotic medications vary in their potency, some medications appear to increase prolactin levels more intensely than other medications in their class, Doraiswamy said. Increased cellular production of prolactin can cause enlargement of the pituitary gland and disrupt production of other hormones, creating hormonal imbalances in the body. It can also lead to the development of pituitary tumors. Most pituitary tumors are benign, and pituitary cancer is extremely rare. Enlargement of the pituitary can cause other problems as well. The gland is located close to the optic nerve, so its enlargement can compress the nerve and cause visual problems, including partial blindness. Any swelling or abnormal growth within the pituitary can press on the brain and lead to headaches, bleeding, and, in some cases, convulsions, Doraiswamy added. Indeed, reported side-effects to the FDA database included 796 reports of increased blood levels of the hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia); 503 reports of the cessation of menses in women (amenorrhea); 630 reports of production of breast milk in adults and children of both sexes (galactorrhea); and male breast development. Ninety of the reports of hyperprolactinemia and 96 of the reports of galactorrhea occurred in children and adolescents. According to Doraiswamy, these symptoms can be indicative of a pituitary disturbance but not necessarily of a pituitary tumor. All reported side-effects were most strongly associated with risperidone, which also accounted for 82 percent of all reported occurrences of side-effects in children and adolescents, Doraiswamy said. The researchers are concerned that development of pituitary tumors following chronic use of potent antipsychotics may pose a problem in mentally ill patients, particularly children. 'In this population, we worry that symptoms may not be evaluated quickly enough, which, if due to a tumor, could lead to complications such as visual problems or localized bleeding near the pituitary gland,' Doraiswamy said. 'Although such serious side-effects are quite rare, prescribing physicians, patients and their family members should watch for them because they can be controlled.' Doraiswamy noted that the patterns of reported side-effects contained in a database as large as the FDA's may never have been fully appreciated without the use of the MGPS algorithm method, which was developed in part by Szarfman, the study's lead author. More than 1,000 adverse drug events are added to the FDA's drug safety database every day, and the system now holds more than 2.5 million entries. The large numbers suggest millions of possible combinations between medications and side-effects that no human could ever compute, monitor or contextualize on their own, Doraiswamy said. Doraiswamy has previously received funding and consulting fees from all companies that manufacture the antipsychotic medications examined in this study. They are Janssen Pharmaceutica, the manufacturer of risperidone (Risperdal); Bristol-Myers Squibb Company/Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of aripiprazole (Abilify); Novartis Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of clozapine (Clozaril); Eli Lilly and Company, manufacturer of olanzapine (Zyprexa); AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, manufacturer of quetiapine (Seroquel); and McNeill Laboratories/Janssen Pharmaceutica, manufacturer and developer of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (Haldol).

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The Amish communities offer a model for truly healthy stress free living from which we can learn. Most Americans mock their outward lifestyle while ignoring the essence of their traditions. Yet, they are much healthier as a group than the rest of modern American society. Vaccination Controversy If you do a Google search, you will find a lot of contradictory articles on whether or not the Amish submit to vaccinations. Vaccinating infants would be difficult since Amish newborns are usually delivered in their homes, usually assisted by midwives. Multiple Hepatitis B vaccinations are started with newborns in the hospitals soon after they're delivered. Multiple Hep-B vaccinations are pushed ostensibly to protect newborns from a liver disease that is transmitted sexually or by needles among drug users. Even if Hep-B vaccinations worked, they would be totally useless for infants unless their mothers are in this risk population. This vaccine and others in the onslaught of toxic vaccinations among infants are associated with the surging rise in autism and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Around 1995, Dan Olmstead, editor of the website Age of Autism, investigated the heavily Amish populated area of Pennsylvania and found just three cases of autism. One was with a Chinese child who had received several vaccinations prior to being adopted by an Amish family. The other was a rare case of an Amish family succumbing to mainstream propaganda and medical pressure for vaccinating their child. That child became autistic soon after . Olmstead could not find any background on the third case. But if the ratio of national autism statistics were duplicated in these Amish communities, there should have been around 200 cases of autism, not just three. Mainstream medicine claims this is due to genetics. Despite contrary rumors, many agree that hardly any vaccinations are administered in Amish regions. The Polio Incident In 2005, a bogus polio outbreak among the Amish was heavily reported by the mainstream media (MSM). Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and others thoroughly debunked this so-called outbreak. There were four children whose stools had a trace of polio virus. They were not suffering from any paralysis. The polio virus strain was not wild. It actually came from an oral polio vaccine (OPV) . So it was not even a polio breakout. The extremely young children, one was seven months old, had no serious polio symptoms. But how did they ingest OPVs? Though OPVs continued to be administered in developing countries and caused polio , they were dropped out of use in the USA around 2000. The 2005 incident did get enough MSM coverage to create a scare. Was this part of an agenda to scare the Amish into rushing for vaccinations ? Other Amish Health Factors The Amish tradition of no cars or TVs is too difficult for most of us now. Even growing our own food is not practical - yet! But this is the essential Amish model. They don't eat junk food. They don't drink alcohol or smoke. Pharmaceuticals and vaccinations are almost non-existent. They produce their own raw milk and dairy and grow their own organic produce. They also engage in physical labor and walk a lot. As a result, they barely have any cases of heart problems or diabetes, and practically no obesity issues. Their cancer rate is an amazing 72% lower than the national norm. The Amish sense of egalitarian community and cooperation precludes competition and economic status. Everyone pitches in when needed, even for building homes and barns. As things get worse, we may need to gradually shift into the basic Amish model for a stress free healthy existence.

0," With health fears over reports resulting from consuming artificial sweeteners, most people looking for a zero calorie sugar substitute have been left wanting -- until now. It's not that safe, natural, low-calorie sugar substitutes were unavailable, just that the public doesn't know much about them. There are actually several delicious natural sugar substitutes that can take the place of any artificial sweetener -- even in baking -- and one surprise that makes them all taste even better. And the best part is most have no worrisome side effects. Stevia Stevia is the darling of the zero-calorie sugar substitutes, with good reason. It's totally natural, plant based, has no calories at all, 40 times sweeter than sugar, won't cause spikes in blood sugar levels and has no discernible side effects. Stevia caught on slowly due to initially having a bitter aftertaste; however, manufacturers of stevia products have started using the sweeter parts of the stevia plant to reduce the bitterness, making it more palatable. Because stevia is so much sweeter than sugar, it's difficult to use in baking. Stevia has not been approved by the FDA at the time of this article, due mainly to the strong lobbying efforts to keep it off the market by the American sugar corporations. Xylitol Xylitol is found naturally in certain fruits, vegetables, and corn cobs and is also a byproduct of animal metabolism. It's been reported that it may help strengthen the immune system and slow aging. Additionally, it contains antibacterial properties and is approved by the FDA. Xylitol has 9 calories per teaspoon and can be used in cooking and baking -- but please use non-GMO products. Substitute it for half the amount of sugar called for in a recipe. It protects against the formation of dental cavities, because the bacteria in the mouth do not form acids that attack tooth enamel like they do in combination with refined sugar. Because it will not cause fermentation, xylitol helps fight candida, preventing yeast infections. The one down side of eating xylitol is that too much can cause gas, diarrhea and bloating. Luo Han Guo Luo Han Guo is a sweet fruit found in China whose extract is used as a sugar substitute. Momordica grosvenori, the fruit yielding Luo han guo extract is a type of cucumber squash. The sweetening agents are called mogrosides and are available in powder form, which are about 250% sweeter than sugar. The product is stable and can be used in cooking and baking. One half teaspoon of Luo han guo has the equivalent sweetness of 25 teaspoons of sugar and less than 1 calorie. It has been used medicinally in China for hundreds of years to ease gastrointestinal ailments and respiratory conditions. It helps stabilize blood sugar and it has no known side effects. Salt Not a natural sugar substitute, but a natural flavor enhancer, salt is recommended by Alton Brown of the Food Network as a complement to sweet foods. Used in moderation, a sprinkle of salt brings out the sweetness or any natural sweetener or sugar substitute; and, salt removes any bitterness that may linger in foods. "
0," The 'beauty' police are at it again; this time in Florida where a man is refusing to uproot his edible front yard garden and replace it with water-hogging grass to appease the demands of city officials. As reported by WKMG News in Orlando, Jason Helvingston is bravely standing up for his sovereign freedom to grow whatever he chooses on his own land, which just so happens to be a fully-functioning, well-kept vegetable and herb garden that his neighbors do not seem to be particularly concerned with as a 'nuisance.' Trouble arose for Helvingston several months ago when local code enforcement officials from the City of Orlando first noticed the garden, and subsequently notified the man that his front yard, a 25-foot by 25-foot plot marked by clean rows of radishes and other superfood delectables, was allegedly in violation of local ordinances. Helvingston, a homeowner in the College Park neighborhood of Orlando, challenged the city's vendetta against him, citing the fact that his garden is beneficial, sustainable, and well-enjoyed by locals. But local officials are refusing to relent, having insisted that Helvingston remove his garden by November 5, or else face further action against him. Refusing to allow his sovereign rights to be trampled upon by ignorant bureaucrats, Helvingston is standing his ground and sticking by his natural right to grow his own food. He has even gathered hundreds of signatures from his neighbors as part of a petition to convince the city that its demands are completely unwarranted, and not in the best interests of local citizens. 'I said, 'You'll take my house before you take my vegetable garden,'' explained Helvingston to WKMG News about his dealings with the city in recent days. 'There's nothing wrong here. There's nothing poisonous here. This is a sustainable plot of land. I said to the city, 'All right, we'll put up a fence.' [They said] -- not acceptable.' City of Orlando's Code of Ordinances does not prohibit front-yard gardens As far as we can tell; however, there is nothing in the City of Orlando's Code of Ordinances that prohibits front-yard gardens of the type found in Helvingston's front yard. The only restrictions, according to Section 68.503 of the code, entitled Residential Landscaping , involve fence height and type. Nothing in this section of the code, in other words, makes any sort of requirement about what types of plants or ground cover an Orlando resident is required to plant in their front yard, which makes the city's crusade against Helvingston completely unjustified. 'This is another example of the government telling us what we can do with our own property,' added Helvingston to WKMG News . 'That should never happen.' According to reports, the City of Orlando is well aware that Helvingston is protesting their tyranny, and they are requiring him to go before a city board next month, which will decide how to proceed. In the meantime, freedom advocates are encouraged to call and write the City of Orlando to protest its persecution of Jason Helvingston.

0," As the war on cannabis continues in most U.S. states, one brave North Carolinian who openly grows his own medical cannabis plants -- and broadcasts this fact publicly -- has intentionally taken the fall in a bold move that could be the spark that eventually ends cannabis prohibition in the so-called 'Bible Belt,' an area of the country that has seen the least proactive change with regard to cannabis reform. Medical cannabis activist Robert Dorr, as reported by the Indie Register , was recently arrested for growing his own natural medicine, something he has been doing openly for quite some time in defiance of state law. Unlike the many other growers in his area who have had run-ins with the law for their 'underground' cannabis activities, Dorr has been intentionally open about the fact that he grows cannabis. Rather than try to hide the fact that he grows cannabis, Dorr believes that the only way to instigate real change is to be open about it in order to essentially shatter the status quo. Prior to his arrest, Dorr actually called up the local district attorney and sheriff's office to notify them of his growing activities, even leaving his address so they would know where to find him. And find him they did. According to the Indie Register , Dorr was arrested just a few days later by local sheriff's deputies and shipped off to the local Union County prison near Charlotte, even though his 'crime' was victimless. But Dorr's arrest has not been in vain, as his story is now gaining national attention, illustrating the foolishness of the ongoing anti-cannabis crusade in many parts of the country. North Carolina deputies side with Dorr, admit that legal pharmaceuticals are the real problem Prior to his arrest, Dorr created a Change.org petition directed at North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, who earlier this year failed to bring a floor debate on the Enact Medical Cannabis Act, also known as N.C. 84. The bill, which was rejected by North Carolina's House Rules Committee back in February, would have legalized possession and use of medical marijuana in the state. 'Living in a shadow or being looked upon as something less than a law abiding citizen is no longer acceptable for those who are just that, but use marijuana to treat a disability,' states Dorr in his petition. 'If you are an honorable person who uses marijuana or cannabis medically, speak out about this issue.' As far as his arrest, Dorr's brother told reporters that the arresting officers were actually quite supportive of Dorr's position. Rather than treat him thuggishly as if he was some sort of criminal, the officers were kind and empathetic, admitting that many legal medicines like pharmaceutical drugs are far more dangerous than cannabis. 'They were very compassionate towards his situation which surprised me,' stated Dorr's brother to reporters about the arrest . 'One said that he actually understands why [Dorr uses cannabis] and made mention of legal drugs being worse than the illness and that he believed [cannabis] will be legal in the next five years or so.' The Union County jail website states that Dorr is being charged with manufacturing a schedule VI controlled substance, and his ransom is set at $25,000. In the meantime, Dorr and his supportive family members and friends hope that his story will ignite outrage that eventually leads to positive change for medical cannabis in North Carolina and hopefully surrounding states.

0," Nearly 21 million adults in the United States alone suffer from arthritis. Arthritis is the most common cause of disability, limiting what an otherwise healthy adult is able to do. A person suffering from this condition does not have to spend their life at the doctor's office. There are many natural remedies to help with arthritis pain and inflammation. Causes of arthritis There are two common types of arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are caused by the wearing down of cartilage between the joints. In some cases, the body attacks itself and can lead to other diseases and painful joint and muscle conditions. One of the most common causes is also inflammation. Inflammation is caused by a poor diet The food that people eat plays a major role in their overall health. Foods that are high in sugar, wheat and soy, and foods that are easily converted to sugar, such as alcohol and grains, can lead to inflammation. In order to promote healthy eating habits, a person should avoid foods that contain these ingredients for at least two months. It will take at least six week for the body to flush out its system. Not only will a person notice less pain, but they will feel more active too. Natural supplements There are many natural supplements that will help reduce the symptoms of arthritis. The right amount of glucosamine and chondroitin supplements will help lubricate the joints. Cetyl myristoleate, which is a fatty acid, was also shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Exercise helps There are specific exercises that can help ease the pain of arthritis. Exercises that focus on cardiovascular endurance puts less strain on the muscles and joints. Water aerobics are a great low-pressure way to burn off fat and calories. To apply ice or heat? Both ice and heat sources can help treat the pain of arthritis. Ice seems to be more effective in reducing inflammation and reducing swelling. Heat is best for relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow to stiff joints. Reduce exposure to toxins With an environment that is full of toxins, including lead, mercury, and aluminum, it is important to be on the lookout. Common sources of toxins entering the body are found to be through cookware. Teflon found in most pots and pans can lead to an increased risk for arthritis. Benefits of good bacteria It is important for the body's systems to be balanced. There are many forms of good bacteria, a.k.a. probiotics, that help fight off disease and keep the body regular. This will lead to better overall health and reduce the risk of developing arthritis . Arthritis is a painful condition that affects millions of people. With the proper diet and simple lifestyle changes, a person can reduce their risk for developing this condition and live a life that is free of pain.

0," Eleven years of groundbreaking research and data analysis on hospitalized Medicare patients is to be presented at the 35th annual meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making in Baltimore, Maryland. The analysis has found positive evidence showing how nutritional supplements effectively lower hospital readmission rates. This is big news for the American medical industry, primarily because Medicare patients are typically given prescription drugs instead of nutritional supplements. And that prescription drug system must not be working, for in the current Medicare system, one in five patients are readmitted to a hospital in the same year, costing American taxpayers estimates exceeding $17.5 billion. Affordable Care Act prompting something good? One provision of the Affordable Care Act imposes fines on hospitals whose patient readmission rates exceed national averages. Fines estimated around $227 million are projected to hit over 2,000 hospitals in the next year. The fine, currently at one percent, is set to double going into 2014, punishing those hospitals that can't get their Medicare readmission rates under control. This may pressure hospitals administrators to change their Medicare outpatient care completely, as health care professionals look for alternatives to help elderly patients recover. Instead of welcoming readmissions and collecting Medicare insurance funds, hospitals may actually be pushed to help their patients recover! Entirely new outpatient programs and follow-ups may birth, helping seniors get the nutrition and energy they need to avoid readmission. The most common medical readmission issues Medicare patients face are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. With the right nutritional outpatient care, these vascular problems could subside. If powerful nutritional supplements including the likes of chlorella, hawthorne, and flax seed were utilized, many patients wouldn't have to be readmitted. For example, if follow-up doctor visits encouraged dietary advice and the provision of organic whole food supplements , then patients could heal more efficiently by getting the right enzymes, probiotics, essential fatty acids, minerals and vitamins in their body. This is the best way to cut down on hospital readmission rates - real whole food nutrition. Nutritional supplements cutting down hospital readmission rates The new 11-year study provides clear evidence on how nutritional supplements effectively cut hospital readmission rates. The research, conducted from the University of Southern California and Stanford University, shows how oral nutritional supplements help hospitalized Medicare patients, reducing 30-day hospital readmission rates , lowering patients' length of stay and bringing down taxpayer medical costs.

0," Our food comes from around the world. If the distribution is disrupted by a disaster, how would we feed ourselves? One answer is through small farming systems that can help in food sustainability. To achieve such things like financial aid, technology and educational assistance need to be made readily available to farmers. Small farm systems role in food security Reaching a certain level of food security is very much essential around the world. In some countries, there are high levels of agro biodiversity that is perfect for a small farming set-up. These small farming systems are mostly seen in Africa, Asia and Latin America. With alarming levels of poverty and hunger, a long-term plan is indeed needed to address the scarcity of food most specifically when disasters strike. There are advantages when it comes to small farming set-ups. These farms cool the climate, it is perfect to represent models of sustainability and agro biodiversity. In fact, small farm holders are slowly being recognized as an important key in securing the world's food security and conservation of agricultural set-ups. Achieving food security takes time and long-term investment to reach a level of resiliency, sustainability and productivity when it comes to the agricultural sector. The only problem faced by most of these farmers is that they have limited access to fertile land and decent tools that can help them come up with a good produce. What small farm holders need The downside that most farmers face is the fact that they work hard but do not have the necessary tools, credit, quality seeds, and fertilizers to make their farms fully operational despite facing inclement and unpredictable weather. To level the playing field when it comes to agricultural produce, these small scale farmers need to have access to proper irrigation, affordable fertilizer, high-yielding seeds and other technological advances. If these can be provided for them then they can prove to become efficient and productive small farm systems that can readily supplement food shortage. One way to harness the promise these small farm holders can provide when it comes to securing food supply around the world is to give them the financial assistance that they need. Insurance schemes, funds for agricultural research and other viable innovations must be made within the reach of these farmers to improve the quality of produce that they can market and get income from. Another exciting opportunity small farming systems present is the fact that it can also produce nutritious varieties of plants, crops and fruits that promotes better health for people. These are crops that are high in micronutrients like zinc, iron and vitamins. This is considered an effective weapon in combating malnutrition and other related diseases. "
0," Although armed with good intentions, most preppers and survivalists are making critical errors -- perhaps fatal errors -- in their food preparedness strategies. This article is designed to help you identify and correct those errors as quickly as possible so that you're in good shape before the food collapse arrives. When will that be, exactly? It depends on whom you believe: geologists say the world's primary irrigation aquifers have maybe 20 - 30 years of water remaining , after which the global food supply collapses. Some environmentalists say radical weather, droughts, floods and heat waves have already started wreaking havoc on the food supply (just look at California right now). People concerned about GMOs and genetic pollution point out that runaway crop diseases could strike at any time and devastate global crop production. Finally, those who are more concerned about government tyranny correctly point out that the federal government has already asserted executive order control over all food, farms and livestock . Only the wildly ignorant don't store extra food for emergency preparedness. Even the federal government's Ready.gov program urges people to 'have a plan' and make a disaster supplies kit which contains, 'at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food' -- just enough to keep you alive until FEMA arrives and screws everything up. The problem is that even well-meaning Americans who are trying to prepare for the worst (while hoping for the best) are often going about it all wrong. Here are the top 12 mistakes you might be making right now with storable foods: #1) You're buying storable foods that are loaded with GMOs and MSG Although a very small number of non-GMO storable food sources do exist, most mainstream storable food is loaded with GMOs and MSG. Most of the popular brands of long-term storable food , if you dare to check the labels, contain 'hydrolyzed' proteins or 'autolyzed' proteins, almost all of which are derived from genetically modified soy or corn. At the same time, these prepper foods are typically loaded with 'yeast extract,' a hidden form of MSG. There are going to be a massive number of preppers and survivalists who will be damn shocked one day to discover they've stored thousands of dollars worth of toxic foods, some of which was peddled to them under the false promise that it was all 'non-GMO!' The mere act of 'storing food' is useless unless you store the kind of foods that can truly support your health during times of extremely high stress. Although eating stored foods laced with MSG and GMOs probably won't kill you outright, it will stress your health and nervous system, vastly reducing your alertness and stress adaptation abilities precisely when you need them most. #2) You're likely miscalculating the number of meals you have stored Most storable food companies fudge more than a little on the number of meals their kits provide. A large collection of buckets or boxes emblazoned with the claim, '557 meals!' sounds a lot better than '335' meals, even if it's the same number of calories. So storable food companies have long been in the habit of shrinking the definition of 'meals' in order to make their products appear larger than they really are. Always check the actual number of calories delivered per day, not merely the number of 'meals' you're buying. You may come to find that you've stored 557 children's meals, not adult meals! Another important consideration is to get realistic about your caloric needs. Most Americans are fairly large people who consume far more than the 1,500- 2,000 calories a day which is often considered the 'standard' for survival planning. If you're living on 3,000 calories a day right now but you've only stored food based on 1,500 calories per day meal plans, you're either going to run out of food in half the time you anticipated or you'll force yourself onto a calorie restriction diet (which may not be a terrible thing, if you're like most Americans). #3) You're not rotating your stored foods by eating what you store If you're not eating what you store and rotating your food on a FIFO bases (First In First Out), then you're really just sitting on a rapidly-aging stockpile of questionable food which may or may not be usable when the day comes that you really need it. All the really experienced preppers eat the food they store, and they write dates on incoming food products so they know how old each item is. They also check their stored foods from time to time for rodent infestation or damage. Yes, mice and rats really can chew through thick plastic buckets if given enough time. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) #4) You're not developing skills and experience in growing your own food Stored food sooner or later runs out. If you really want to survive an extended crisis, you'll eventually need to grow your own. But when it comes to growing your own food, many people make the common mistake of thinking all they need to do is 'buy a bunch of heirloom seeds!' Unfortunately, survival gardening involves considerably more than tossing seeds into the dirt and waiting for a bountiful harvest to magically appear. Just like any acquired skill, gardening requires deliberate skill development , and I very much doubt you want to be trying to figure out those skills for the first time in the middle of a regional or global food crisis. That's why buying heirloom seeds is never sufficient all by itself. You need to learn how to transform seeds into edible food while doing so at a net calorie profit . In other words, if your gardening skills are so inefficient that you expend more calories trying to grow the food than you receive from harvesting them, you will starve to death. I fully realize the thought of running a calorie deficit almost never crosses our minds in this modern age of Golden Corral buffets with all-you-can-eat pig slop for humans, yet this is a concept you need to take to heart if you want to live sustainably. (Hint: Growing simple potatoes gives you a huge caloric reward for the required effort, vastly out-pacing the caloric gains for growing vegetables.) #5) You don't have a clean source of trace minerals to feed to your plants Conventional, popular foods are intentionally stripped of nearly all beneficial minerals in order to cause widespread disease, impaired cognitive function and premature death. The easiest way to restore your mineral balance is to grow your own sprouts in a water solution that you've spiked with clean liquid minerals . I use the EasySprouter system to sprout alfalfa seeds, spiking the water holding container with liquid minerals combined with dietary fulvic acid to keep the pH slightly acidic (which sprouts love). What liquid minerals do I use? I happen to operate ICP-MS instrumentation in the selfnews Forensic Food Lab , so I've had the luxury of testing all the popular mineral supplement sold on the market today . In my testing, the Liquid Light product from SunWarrior, Colloidal Minerals from NOW Foods and ColloidaLife from Source Naturals all had zero lead concentrations , zero mercury and near-zero cadmium. In fact, here are my atomic spectroscopy lab results for the NOW Foods product: Aluminum: 39 ppm Copper: 0 ppm Zinc: 0.2 ppm Arsenic: 0 ppm Cadmium: 0 ppm Mercury: 0 ppm Lead: 0 ppm Green PolkaDot Box sells the Liquid Light product from SunWarrior, or you can find any of these on Amazon.com. In fact, you can get a 4-pack of the NOW Foods Colloidal Minerals for about $42 at this link on Amazon . My advice is to stockpile sprouting seeds and CLEAN liquid mineral supplements , thereby giving you the ingredients you need to make your own fresh, sprouted, mineral-rich, raw living superfoods almost instantly. If you're also growing some fruits or nuts in a small orchard for food sustainability, these liquid minerals will help keep those trees alive while vastly enhancing the mineral concentrations of the fruits and nuts they produce. If the EasyGreen Sprouter is too expensive for you, seeds can also be sprouted in these dirt-cheap sprout bags . #6) You're not building relationships with local farmers and food producers If you want local farms to continue to exist, you need to support them with your business. But this is more than an economic principle: you also need to build relationships with local food producers so that they know and trust you. When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, hundreds of thousands of refugees streamed into Central Texas looking for food. They slammed the local CSAs, hoping to buy up the food that was being grown there. But the CSAs already had contractual obligations to deliver that food to their regular customers, and that's exactly what they did. If you're a regular customer of a farm or a local CSA, you're going to receive preferential status compared to someone that farm has never met. In a food crisis, this can quite literally mean the difference between having a meal on your plate versus going hungry. That's why I say build relationships now by supporting your local farmers, egg producers, raw milk producers, local cheese producers and anyone else who produces food for local markets. #7) You're storing the wrong barter items that few people will trade for food The subject of barter is old hat to preppers, so I'm not going to dwell on this point. But what is worth pointing out is that you need to think of what items a farmer needs rather than merely what items you think hold value in a general sense. As a concrete example, I doubt many farmers are going to have much use for your gold coins in the middle of a food crisis. They probably have far greater need for varmint ammo, which has been extremely difficult to come by since December of 2012. Almost every farmer I know could use a whole lot more 22 LR ammo or other varmint rounds. In this case, lead is far more valuable than gold because gold can't protect the crops in the field. So think strategically about what *farmers* will need in a barter situation, not merely what you think holds value in a general economic sense. When Japan occupied Taiwan during World War II, the only thing that could get you a roof over your head was food for barter. Gold was considered absolutely worthless because possessing gold was considered a crime punishable by death. So nobody wanted it. Other ideas for barter items that farmers value: As someone who raises chickens and has worked around cattle operations, I can assure you that one of the most in-demand items for farms is, believe it or not, sanitizing solutions . Keeping chicken houses in a clean, sanitary condition requires real effort, and every farmer knows that dirty conditions equal disease and animals deaths. So stocking up on germicides and disinfectants is actually a very smart barter strategy. Such items also have medical uses for humans, too, not just ranch animals. And if you've ever studied economic collapse scenarios, you know that sanitizing solutions very quickly run out, leaving people with the very real risk of dying from simple infections. This gallon container of providone iodine from Amazon.com is a pretty good value, and its real-world value is almost priceless on a farm or ranch when supply lines are cut off. #8) You don't have any way to prepare cooked food or acquire clean water Most of your stored food is probably worthless without clean water and a way to cook it, yet many preppers have no real way to acquire a steady supply of clean water, and they have no experience cooking foods without city-provided electricity and natural gas. Perhaps it's only because prepping has become so popular these days that more and more urban dwellers now fancy themselves to be 'prepared' even though they've never boiled a pot of water on a camp stove. Nevertheless, I've met plenty of people who have a large supply of GMO-based food powders and MSG 'meals' socked away in a closet with nary a thought of how they might actually turn such substances into edible meals in the middle of a serious crisis. #9) You don't have any practical way to defend your food or hide it Looters love preppers because preppers do all the shopping for them in advance. The literal game plan for many people in a survival crisis is to 'use my gun to get what I need.' Those people are, of course, criminal-minded looters. Those of us who are real preppers and real Americans call them 'targets of opportunity.' If you aren't prepared to defend your food -- or hide it really, really well -- then you almost might as well not bother storing it. And by 'defend your food' the implication is that you may have to do so with force. Pleading, 'please don't take my food' probably won't get you much traction in a crisis. People who think all the normal social rules of politeness and lawful action will still be upheld in a crisis are stupid or naive. Here's a tip: Every looter makes a risk / reward calculation as they attempt to acquire food and other supplies. Your job as a prepper is to make the RISK so high for any would-be looter that they feel incredibly compelled to look for food elsewhere. How is high risk communicated to would-be looters? Not by showing yourself and waving a gun around, I hope you realize. It would be far better to keep your location a secret while simultaneously demonstrating to the looters that they going to meet determined resistance to property theft and lawlessness. When in doubt, give them some of your rifle ammo, one round at a time, at 1850 fps. #10) You don't have a way to grow food that's protected from radioactive fallout The worsening Fukushima situation is, by any rational standard, one of the most pressing concerns of our time. The failed nuclear facility remains just one earthquake or tidal wave away from total collapse followed by fuel rod meltdown that contaminates the entire Northern Hemisphere with radioactive fallout. Any food grown outdoors during a radioactive fallout scenario will of course absorb radioactive isotopes that fall onto the soils. These isotopes include cesium-137, which has a half-life of about 30 years and just happens to be the isotope that still renders the lands around Chernobyl uninhabitable. The best defense against atmospheric fallout affecting your crops is to grow your food in a greenhouse that's protected from atmospheric fallout. Relatively few people have a greenhouse structure suitable for growing any significant portion of their food supply, and almost no one has a greenhouse running HEPA dust filtration which would remove radioactive particles from the air. #11) You don't have any defense against eating radioactive isotopes in your food As food absorbs radioactive isotopes, it becomes radioactive itself, and any who eat it risk integrating radioactive isotopes into their body's cells. Cesium-137, the most insidious isotope in terms of agricultural implications, mimics potassium in human biology and so goes everywhere in your body that potassium goes. Fortunately, a solution on this particular point is now at hand. I recently finalized research and development on a cesium-blocking dietary substance which will be available in April of this year. This was developed in our atomic spectroscopy laboratory and achieved by testing over 1,000 substances for their natural cesium binding capabilities. The efficacy of this particular formula is 96%, meaning it can bind with and capture up to 96% of cesium-134 and cesium-137 atoms during digestion, in the gastrointestinal tract. This parallels the function of Prussian Blue , a painter's pigment chemical which was approved by the FDA as a defense against radiological terrorism. It was also embraced by the CDC for its ability to block radioactive cesium during digestion. If you'd like to be kept informed of the release date of this cesium-blocking dietary substance, just join the email announcement list at the end of this article. #12) You are still living in a 'death trap' city that you cannot reasonably escape in a real crisis Yes, I know, your plan to leave the city is still imminent. But the pay is too good, and city living is really, really convenient, right? You'll move out to the country 'one of these days' and hope nothing bad happens until then. It's a great plan until the day it isn't. Every prepper who has read anything by James Wesley Rawles knows that urban areas are death traps in the middle of a real crisis. They also tend to be places where federal authorities go house to house, either imprisoning people in their own homes (as we saw after the Boston Marathon bombings) or confiscating their self defense weapons, leaving honest citizens vulnerable to looters. Any plan to leave a large city by road during a serious crisis isn't actually a plan: it's a fairy tale. The only ways to successfully leave a city during a real crisis are by plane, boat, on foot or in a casket. In all these scenarios, you usually can't take much with you, so all the food you've stored in your city house or apartment is useless.

0," At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

0," As summer approaches, most people spend more time outdoors; and with that comes the chance of developing a poison ivy allergy. Oils from these devilish weeds are highly noxious, causing a long list of poison ivy allergy symptoms. Contact with a poison ivy plant can produce a red, swollen rash, blisters, pain, and unbearable itching. In addition there may be intense burning, inflammation, and fever. For those unlucky enough to have a poison ivy rash in their eyes, mouths or on their genitals, the torment can be nearly intolerable. Fortunately, nature has not only cursed us with these weeds, but also provided a list of home remedies for allergic reactions to poison ivy, oak, and sumac. Homeopathic remedies for allergic reaction to poison ivy Rhus Toxicodendron: Rhus tox is made from poison ivy and one of the best remedies not only for treating the rash but for prophylactic use in its prevention. The person needing Rhus tox will have a poison ivy allergy with a rash that itches intensely, and is made better with hot applications such as a hot compress or bath. The person may be extremely restless and have accompanying joint or muscle pain. Speak to a homeopath about taking Rhus tox in low doses throughout the season to prevent a poison ivy outbreak. Anacardium orientale: The rash has fluid-filled blisters that itch intensely, but hot applications make the itching worse. Apis: Helpful for a poison ivy allergy that appears as large, blotchy hives. They may be bright pink, swollen, sting, and burn. Discomfort is alleviated by cold applications. Belladona: This remedy is often helpful when the rash appears suddenly, is bright red and very hot, and accompanied by a fever. Kali Sulphuricm: The poison ivy rash will be yellow and pus-filled with terrible itching and a tendency to become infected. Sulfur: Poison ivy allergy is worse during bathing or when first getting into a warm bed. It's often a dry rash with crusts. The itching is unbearable and the person will scratch until the skin bleeds. Graphites: Similar to sulfur, this poison ivy rash also crusts over; but oozes a sticky, golden fluid. Itching is worse at night and in a warm bed. Urtica Urens: The rash is blotchy, stings and burns intensely. Cold applications make the symptoms worse as does scratching. Poison ivy allergy is often accompanied by rheumatism and joint pain. Croton Tiglium: Skin feels tight, itching and scratching is painful. Much oozing from blisters that form especially on the face and genitals. Home remedies for allergic reactions Baking soda: An excellent home remedy to relieve itching from poison ivy allergy. Add 1/2 cup to a bath or make a paste with water or apple cider vinegar and apply to the rash. Oatmeal: Apply a paste of cooked oatmeal to the rash to help draw the toxins and relieve the itching. Himalayan crystal salt: A paste of salt and water will help draw toxins and fluids from the poison ivy rash, drying the skin and soothing the itching. Soak in a warm salt bath. Goldenseal: Mix a paste of goldenseal powder and water or apple cider vinegar and apply to the rash to protect against infections. Works well for poison oak and sumac as well. Pascalite clay: A form of bentonite clay, Pascalite pulls toxins and fluids from the rash, drying and relieving itching. Apply a paste made with water and cover with plastic wrap to keep it moist. Aloe vera gel: Use aloe vera gel from the inner flesh of the leaves topically to relieve pain and itching. "
0," A team of researchers led by Ronald Crystal at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York have developed two 'anti-addiction' vaccines, which stop cocaine from reaching the brain. Crystal says he hopes to see people 'thinking about addiction the same way you think about mumps and measles and polio, and eradicating it.' The first vaccine uses viral proteins of a modified cold virus attached to cocaine-like molecules to trigger the body to produce cocaine antibodies. During trials on monkeys, researchers used an imaging molecule paired with PET brain scans to measure how effective the vaccine was in preventing cocaine from reaching the brain. LiveScience reported, 'In the monkeys with the cocaine vaccine, the imaging molecule lit up the brain like fireworks. This means little to none of the cocaine administered made it into their brains.... Unvaccinated monkeys gave a much dimmer signal in the brain.' The second method uses a type of gene therapy to introduce the cocaine-like virus into the liver; the liver then produces genetic material that contains a blueprint for the cocaine antibody. Rats vaccinated with this second method produced an abundant amount of cocaine antibodies and did not display symptoms of getting 'high' for up to 17 weeks after vaccination. Thomas Kosten, a researcher for Baylor College of Medicine called the carriers used by Crystal's team 'interesting.' Kosten's approach, which reached human trials in 2013, uses cholera attached to a cocaine-like molecule to trigger an immune response to the drug. Vaccines developed by Crystal's and Kosten's teams would most likely require periodic vaccination. LiveScience explains that the vaccines block cocaine from reaching the brain, thus preventing a high in the user, but do not deal with or treat the desire to feel the high, therefore 'there is a worry that drug addicts would try to 'out-compete' their antibodies against the drug by taking it in much larger amounts.' Researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College still have to test the toxicity of the vaccines, but planned to begin human trials by mid-2014.

0," The maca plant is a product from South America, and it was originally found in large quantities in the Andean mountains of Peru. The Peruvians like to use maca flour for baking as a base and a flavoring ingredient. It has long been known to normalize the body's stress response and of course provide help to people coping with certain sexual dysfunctions. As an adaptogen, rather than triggering hormones that affect the body's inner balance, maca simply stabilizes and regulates metabolism. Generally speaking, it's quite a reliable herb to help reduce fatigue, anxiety, stress, depression and sleep problems. It is quite rich in various nutrients, especially calcium, phosphorus, vitamins B1 and B12, vitamin C and fatty acids. Limited research has shown its ability to somewhat increase HDL cholesterol levels over time. Although maca is believed to offer various health benefits, most of the serious studies mainly revolve around its ability to counter sexual or menopausal symptoms and problems. There is also hope that it may be able to prevent or diminish prostate enlargement. Prostate size can be reduced with maca extracts The Asian Journal of Andrology published a study showing that maca has the ability to diminish prostate size. Different maca root extracts were basically given to male rats with induced prostatic hyperplasia. The results showed that hydroalcoholic or aqueous extract of red maca was the most capable of reducing the overall weight and size of the rats' prostates. The BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine published a study aiming to verify if maca root preparations could be considered as an alternative to help treat certain sexual dysfunctions in men or women. Clinical trials were performed by two independent authors and on voluntary male and female adults. The results of these tests showed extremely positive outcomes as far as increasing sexual desire in either healthy menopausal women or adult males. Encouraging results were also noted for patients suffering from erectile dysfunctions. In another study that lasted for at least four months, men aged between 22 and 44 were orally given maca extracts in order to study its effects on their reproductive system. The researchers found that the semen volume, the total sperm count and the sperm motility all substantially increased, while hormone levels surprisingly remained stable throughout the process. Other studies demonstrated that hot flashes, vaginal dryness, depression and fatigue, which are all possible menopausal symptoms, could be contained and diminished by maca extracts. Lastly, a study involving rats showed that maca was able to increase litter size, therefore backing the initial assertion about its effectiveness in increasing fertility. Limited research was also able to show that maca seemed capable of reversing male infertility due to lead exposure. "
0," Patrick Swayze's death came as a shock to many people. But not to his own cancer doctor: They know that the five-year survival rates of people being treated with chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer are virtually zero. And Swayze was only the latest in a long list of celebrities dying after being treated with chemotherapy and other toxic forms of western medicine: Farrah Fawcett died following chemotherapy used to treat anal cancer and liver cancer. ( http://www.selfnews.com/026511_cancer_che... ) Famed newscaster Peter Jennings died from chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer. Former White House press secretary Tony Snow died after receiving chemotherapy for colon cancer. ( http://www.selfnews.com/023626_cancer_che... ) Celebrities still battling cancer Desperate Housewives actress Kathry Joosten is currently battling lung cancer. It's not clear whether she has undergone chemotherapy yet, or plans to, but she did have cancer surgery in 2001 which obviously didn't 'cure' the cancer because it has now returned. Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs looks deathly ill after undergoing not only chemotherapy but also a complicated cancer surgery that removed a part of his pancreas and digestive tract. ( http://www.selfnews.com/News_000671_Steve... ) Sheryl Crow is battling breast cancer, but she famously decided to support her immune system with natural medicine by turning to a Traditional Chinese Medicine wellness center called Tao of Wellness ( http://www.taoofwellness.com ). No doubt her outcome will be vastly improved by this integrative approach. Unfortunately, her hubby Lance Armstrong is more into the conventional drugs-and-chemo approach, and most people probably don't realize the two things that saved Armstrong's life were intense exercise and regular exposure to sunshine during his cycling training (creating vitamin D, a powerful anti-cancer nutrient). (And wearing those little yellow Livestrong bracelets only tags you as being completely brainwashed about cancer and the cancer industry .) Other celebrities engaging in cancer battles (or who already experienced them) include Sonique, Kylie and Anastacia. Deadly pharmaceuticals Beyond those celebrities being harmed or killed by chemotherapy, many are also killed by conventional pharmaceuticals: Michael Jackson died from an overdose of doctor-prescribed pharmaceuticals. Tim Russert's death is linked to heart medication ( http://www.selfnews.com/023434.html ). Bernie Mac died from immune suppression caused by pharmaceuticals ( http://www.selfnews.com/023817_Bernie_Mac... ). And Heath Ledger was killed by an overdose of pharmaceuticals prescribed by his doctors ( http://www.selfnews.com/022602.html ). The cancer industry wants your money The reason so many celebrities are harmed or killed by the cancer industry is quite simple: The cancer industry is a for-profit business . It makes money by treating cancer , not by curing or preventing cancer. In fact, there's a huge difference between what the public see with cancer clinics vs. what really happens. The public image of the cancer industry is bright and cheery. 'We save lives,' they insist, and they claim to offer 'support' for cancer survivors (which are more correctly called ' chemotherapy survivors'). But behind closed doors, the real picture of the cancer industry is far more insidious. Cancer centers produce primarily two things: 1) Profits, and 2) Body bags (with cancer victims inside). Cancer is a booming business. There's a ton of money to be made in screening for cancer, then causing cancer with the screening equipment, then diagnosing cancer and treating cancer. The purpose of conventional cancer treatments is not to eliminate the patient's disease, but rather to keep the patient alive long enough to receive a never-ending regimen of expensive, high-profit cancer treatments. The cancer industry (the conventional cancer clinics, non-profits, drug companies, National Cancer Institute, etc.) flat-out refuses to recommend anti-cancer nutrients (like vitamin D) that could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year. They refuse to speak out against cancer-causing processed meats and carcinogenic chemicals in cosmetics personal care products. They cleverly avoid talking about the environmental causes of cancer, preferring to limit their criticism to only tobacco. Meanwhile, they churn their gargantuan profit machines through a sea of cancer victims, plucking profits from the near-dead bodies of those they claim to treat. And when parents of teens refuse to subject their children to the chemotherapy poisons forced upon patients, Child Protective Services gets called, and the State kidnaps the children and forces them to be injected with chemotherapy. ( http://www.selfnews.com/026305_medicine_c... ) The cancer industry, by any honest assessment, is a sham. Pure quackery. That's why two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling says, 'Everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud and that the major cancer research organizations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them.' Dr. Julian Whitaker, founder of the Whitaker Wellness Institute ( www.WhitakerWellness.com ) also wrote about the cancer industry, saying: Without exception, all the oncologists I talked to about Dr Burzynski were scornful and hostile. Twenty- five years of practicing unconventional medicine did not prepare me for what I discovered. Delving into attitudes, actions, and beliefs of modern oncologists was like opening a box of cereal and finding it full of worms. They just don't care The question I kept asking was why, and the answer to that question gradually began to creep out: Dr Burzynski's discovery threatens one of the largest and most lucrative industries in the history of mankind, the cancer treatment industry. All those radiation machines and doctors who run them All those chemotherapy drugs and the doctors who prescribe them All those so called studies that just juggle the doses of chemo & radiation All those surgeons who have been flailing at cancer for over a 100 years... Also it is not just about money, it is about strongly held beliefs, beliefs that have meshed with the personality of virtually everyone in the cancer treatment industry, especially the physicians. In short, these beliefs are that cancer can only be treated with therapies that mutilate, poison, or burn the patient, in the hope that they 'kill' the cancer..Therefore, each patient who is miraculously cured by Burzynski's nontoxic therapy is not viewed as a breakthrough, or even as something good, but rather as a dangerous messenger of heresy, a terrible threat to their beliefs. The vested interests The vested interests in cancer don't want the general public to hear about cancer cures and natural remedies. That cuts into their profits. They would far prefer that patients remain illiterate victims who have no knowledge of anything beyond surgery, chemotherapy and pharmaceuticals. Anything that offers freedom to cancer patients -- freedom of choice, freedom of medicine, freedom to choose their healing modality -- is a threat to the powerful vested interests. And it is those vested interested that are driving first-world nations into disease and bankruptcy, by the way. Rather than allowing natural cancer cures and prevention strategies to see the light of day, they attack and discredit natural anti-cancer products and therapies, much like a Chicago mob boss snuffs out his competition to keep control of the streets. One day, when America's economy finally collapses under the weight of irreversible debt, remember this: The cancer industry was one of the major players that drove this nation into bankruptcy. A population suffering from high rates of cancer isn't very productive. Lives are lost and economic productivity plunges. Money that could have been spent on schools and technology research is, instead, spent on conventional cancer quackery known as 'chemotherapy.' It wastes money, it wastes lives, and it challenges the boundaries of sanity. This goes for any nation: If you have a profitable cancer industry, you have no long-term economic future, because the cancer industry will always find clever new ways to cause cancer (mammography) and rake in the profits by keeping the population diseased. The only way for any nation to have a real future is to take the profit out of sickness and disease through a radical restructuring of the entire medical system. And remember this: If you're an evil bastard, and you want to make a lot of money (trillions) off of other peoples' suffering, simply latch on to a deadly disease, sign sponsorship deals with the drug companies, tell the public you're 'looking for a cure' and then use the money you raise from donation events to actually cause the disease in the population at large. This is most easily accomplished by incorporating some sort of disease-causing element into your 'screening' process so that when people get your 'free screening,' they are simultaneously being diseased and are likely to become a future customer. In the cancer business, this is accomplished through mammography which emits radiation, causing breast cancer. It's a great little scam for those who are willing to exchange ethics for profits. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Scientists at the Monell Chemical Senses Center report that the ability to perceive the bitter taste of vegetables is a combination of taste genes and the presence of naturally-occurring toxins in a given vegetable. The study appears in the September 19 issue of Current Biology. Scientists have always assumed that the ability to sense bitterness evolved as a defense mechanism to detect potentially harmful toxins in plants. This study provides support for this hypothesis by establishing that variants of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R38 can detect glucosinolates, a class of compounds with potentially harmful physiological actions, in natural foods. Glucosinolates are considered anti-thyroid because they inhibit the uptake of iodine into the thyroid which increases the risk of goiter and decreases the levels of thyroid hormones, hence they have come to be collectively known as goitrogens. The thyroid converts iodine into thyroid hormones which are essential for protein synthesis and for regulating the body's metabolism. The ability to taste glucosinolates and then avoid them could be a selective advantage to the 'over 1 billion people who are at risk for thyroid insufficiency'. 'The findings show that our taste receptors are capable of detecting toxins in the natural setting of the fruit and vegetable plant matrix,' said senior author Paul Breslin, a Monell sensory scientist. Thirty five healthy adults were selected for the study and placed in one of three categories depending on genotype (hTAS2R38 gene). These groups were: 1) sensitive to the bitter tasting chemical PTC, 2)Insensitive to the bitter taste of PTC and 3) Showed intermediate sensitivity. Each subject was then given a variety of vegetables, some containing glucosinolates while others did not. Examples of the glucosinolate-containing vegetables include watercress, broccoli, bok choy, kale, kohlrabi, and turnip; while the non-glucosinolate foods included radicchio, endive, eggplant and spinach. Subjects with the sensitive receptor rated the glucosinolate-containing vegetables as 60% more bitter than did subjects with the insensitive form. The other vegetables were rated equally bitter by the two groups, demonstrating that variations in the hTAS2R38 gene has specificity to foods containing glucosinolate toxins. 'The sense of taste enables us to detect bitter toxins within foods, and genetically-based differences in our bitter taste receptors affect how we each perceive foods containing a particular set of toxins,' summarizes Breslin. Breslin notes, 'The contents of the veggies are a double-edged sword, depending upon the physiological context of the individual eating them. Most people in industrialized cultures can and should enjoy these foods. In addition to providing essential nutrients and vitamins, many are reported to have anti-cancer properties.' Reference: Article adapted by Medical News Today from original press release. The article did not mention that there are ways to get the benefits of these vegetables without the goitrogenic effects. The first and I believe best way is via lacto-fermentation (fermenting with live lactobacillus). The fermentation converts the glucosinolates to harmless substances. Fermentation retains all the cancer-inhibiting properties of these vegetables, retains all the vitamin and mineral content and at the same time actually makes certain enzymes and more vitamins, especially the B vitamins and Vitamin K. The second method is cooking, preferably light steaming. Again, this converts the glucosinolates to harmless compounds.

0," Humanity's quest to outsmart the Creator by developing robots of a higher and more adaptable level of intelligence could prove disastrous for the survival of our species, says Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. Speaking at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit in San Francisco, Musk told Aspen Institute President and CEO Walter Isaacson that artificial intelligence (AI), at least as it is currently advancing, threatens to destroy human life by making robots inherently smarter and more intuitive. A vocal proponent of AI technology, Isaacson wrote in a recent Aspen Journal of Ideas piece that today's biggest innovations are coming from efforts that combine human inspiration with computer processing -- this is the essence of AI. 'Decade after decade, new waves of experts have claimed the imminent arrival of artificial intelligence, perhaps even a 'singularity' when computers aren't only smarter than humans but also can design themselves to be even supersmarter, and will thus no longer need us mere mortals,' wrote Isaacson. It is this seemingly sci-fi concept that Musk worries will spell the undoing of humanity, as technologists dive headfirst into a brave new world controlled by machines that possess an advanced and ever-evolving level of intelligence. 'I don't think anyone realizes how quickly artificial intelligence is advancing,' warned Musk at the meeting. 'Particularly if [the machine is] involved in recursive self-improvement... and its utility function is something that's detrimental to humanity, then it will have a very bad effect.' 'If its [function] is just something like getting rid of e-mail spam and it determines the best way of getting rid of spam is getting rid of humans...,' he trailed off, to the resounding laughter of an amused crowd. Will advancing AI breed Terminator-like killing machines? While AI has long earned a top spot in the list of budding technological advancements that are always just a few decades off, it seems that some major AI breakthroughs are imminent. Several recent reports explain that quantum AI, which incorporates quantum mechanics with AI technology, is already being used to help robots and computers 'learn' how to respond intuitively to external stimuli. 'In the case of very demanding and 'impatient' environments, the outcome is that the quantum robot can adapt itself and survive, while the classic robot is destined to collapse,' wrote G. Davide Paparo and Miguel A. Martin-Delgado, two researchers from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) in Spain in a study explaining how quantum tools are being used to advance AI progress. 'The advances [quantum AI] brings are not only quantitative in terms of greater speed, but also qualitative: adapting better to environments where the classic agent does not survive. This means that quantum robots are more creative.' In Musk's view, the potential for robots designed in this way to turn evil is great, potentially resembling the Terminator robot from the popular Arnold Schwarzenegger movies that deviated from what its creators intended. 'In the movie 'Terminator,' they didn't create AI to -- they didn't expect, you know, some sort of Terminator-like outcome,' added Musk. 'It is sort of like the Monty Python thing. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.' Despite his concerns, Musk is one of the investors backing a Silicon Valley startup known as Vicarious, which is all about developing and promoting AI. According to Business Insider , the company remains largely secretive about its projects but is known to be actively working on advanced AI technologies. 'My goals have always been to embody the computational principles of the brain in a mathematical model,' stated neuroscientist Dileep George, one of Vicarious' founders, in a 2012 interview with KurzweilAI, which actively monitors and forecasts what it describes as 'accelerating change.'

0," In yet another stunningly insensitive example of just how out-of-control the federal leviathan has become - and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), especially - another absurd 'training video' has surfaced featuring IRS employees and paid for with your tax dollars. The video, which was posted on the House Ways and Means Committee website, features about a dozen IRS employees line-dancing on a stage. From The Associated Press : The video of the IRS workers practicing their dance moves, which lasts just under three minutes, comes weeks after it was revealed that agency workers produced two other videos parodying the 'Star Trek' and 'Gilligan's Island' TV shows. The latest recording cost about $1,600 and was produced to be shown at the end of a 2010 training and leadership conference held in Anaheim, Calif., said IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge. 'The outrage is only growing stronger' In addition to the fact that the IRS has been used as a thuggish political tool against conservative and Tea Party organizations which dared to apply for tax-exempt status, the new video antics surface at a time when several government agencies, along with federal Defense Department employees and medical personnel at the nation's military hospitals are being furloughed due to across-the-board budget cuts. The IRS conference itself has become the target of a Treasury Department inspector general report due out soon. Titled 'Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and Conference Abuses,' the report became the subject of a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing May 31. All of the videos in question were turned over to the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee following a request for them from Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., a senior member. 'The outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger,' Boustany, who chairs the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, told AP. 'Clearly this is an agency where abuse and waste is the norm and not the exception.' As per the usual, some IRS official issued a written mea culpa, talking about how the video was an 'unacceptable and an inappropriate use of government funds,' as if taxpayers didn't already know that. The statement also said - of course - that the agency was implementing new policies 'to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used appropriately' (which makes you wonder why such policies weren't already in place). In describing the video, AP reported: In the video, various workers comment as colleagues practice their dancing in the background to music that sounds like 'Cupid Shuffle,' a 2007 hit by the performer Cupid. In the version obtained by The Associated Press , IRS employees' names have been erased. At a point in the video, one woman says, 'And I thought doing the 'Star Trek' video was humiliating.' Oh, so funny - not. No, we do not consent What is patently obvious to everyone but the most committed autobot is that the federal government - in all its bloated, overpowering omnipresence - is just out of control , period. The level of contempt in which an ever-increasing number of federal employees treat American taxpayers who provide them with lavish pay, benefits and retirement is just appalling. But who can blame them when they are enabled by career federal bureaucrats used to abusing the taxpayer's trust, only to work their way up the career ladder where they can heap more abuse on the governed masses. To simply say that 'Congress needs to do something' is not enough anymore. Congress certainly does need to act, as does this president, but in concrete, meaningful ways that send a message such abuse will no longer be sanctioned or tolerated. People need to be fired and, where appropriate, brought up on charges. Otherwise, trust in government will continue to plummet until someday there will no longer exist the concept of 'the consent of the governed.' "
0," According to a study conducted by researchers from UC Berkeley, a sleepless night may make you likely to eat junk food rather than healthier choices like vegetables and whole grains. This study offers additional insights into the link between obesity and poor sleep. Researchers scanned the brains of 23 young adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were scanned both after a normal night's sleep and after a sleepless night. When comparing the results of the scans, researchers found that, following sleep deprivation, the brain's frontal lobe activity was impaired. Furthermore, there was increased activity in the deeper brain centers that are known to respond to rewards. They also found that participants were much more likely to favor unhealthy foods when sleep deprived. According to UC Berkeley professor of psychology and neuroscience Matthew Walker, this shows that, while the more primal brain structures controlling motivation and desire are amplified following sleep deprivation, the higher level brain regions required for more complex decision-making were impaired. This is how junk food cravings become insatiable -- the combination is increased primal desire with impairment in higher brain function. When combined with the fact that unhealthy, high-calorie foods become significantly more desirable to a person who has been sleep-deprived, this explains why people who sleep less are more likely to become overweight or obese. While previous studies have shown the link between sleep and obesity , this study is one of the first to illustrate a cause for that link. Participants' brain activities were measured as they were shown images of 80 food items ranging from low- to high-calorie count, as well as healthy and unhealthy choices. These included fruits and vegetables as well as junk foods such as pizza, doughnuts and burgers. Participants were more likely to desire items from the second group following a sleepless night. If you're attempting to lose weight, this may be good news. Ensuring that you get the proper amount of sleep each night can help reduce your cravings and make it easier for you to make healthier choices during the day. Good sleep practices: Searching for 'sleep hygiene tips' is a good way to get standard sleep hygiene methods that are commonly recommended. The effectiveness of sleep hygiene itself has been the subject of much debate. Many report good results, while others suggest that, regardless of the sleep environment or preparatory sleep practices, the hygiene is not 100% effective because it does not serve to calm a busy mind. Other healthy sleep practices involve herbal formulas and melatonin supplementation. Mostly, people experiment with these and discover on their own whether or not they work. However, it is wise to consult your health practitioner for more precise suggestions and testing. And there are numerous other solutions online, such as binaural beats and various 'sleep sound' apps. The goals of these devices seems to be to calm the mind down through distraction so that you can relax and go to sleep. The iNLP Center's Sleep Switch program is another option that roughly 500 known people have used. The goal of Sleep Switch is to turn off the part of your brain that causes self-referential thoughts (autopilot thinking), associated with the brain's Default Mode Network (DMN), that impede the natural sleep cycle. If your restless mind and body do not relax when you get into bed, your DMN may be overactive. MRI scans prove that a certain kind of awareness activity switches off the DMN (highlighted in the March 2010 issue of Scientific American ). The iNLP Center does not have clinical data on the effectiveness of Sleep Switch , other than anecdotal evidence. Dozens of people have reported getting a good night's sleep on the first night of use, with consistent results thereafter. The iNLP Center offers a money-back guarantee on the program, which has been used 2.3% of the time. If you like this article, then like my Facebook Page to keep up with all my writing.

0," Labeling GMO foods is a good idea. But on the way to getting that accomplished, what will our food supply and topsoil be like? It's likely by the time enough consumers catch on, it will be too late for a consumer boycott 'tipping point' that's supposed to bring the evil giant Monsanto to it's knees. All the labeling in the world won't stop Monsanto from creating more seeds and planting more GMO crops, which will continue to contaminate non-GMO crops, including USDA certified organic. All the side effects of GMO crops, damages from excessive glyphosates in RoundUp and other herbicides, toxins from GMOs that contain their own insecticides, will continue to destroy the soil, kill the honey bees, and harm the livestock that feeds on soy and corn. It's already happening. What then must we do? Not enough food savvy consumers in fast food America and an overarching corrupt government leave us with hardly enough ammunition. So we need to enlist farmers in the war against GMOs. More and more farmers who were locked into Monsanto's diabolical contracts are stuck with lower crop yields and over run by RoundUp resistant super-weeds adding to their rising expenses from buying Monsanto's seeds without the right to save seeds for future planting. Livestock farmers who use GMO grains to feed their livestock are reporting die-offs and increased stillbirths that threaten their animals. ( http://www.gaia-health.com ) Enough farmers have been harassed by Monsanto for bogus patent infringements of seed or pollen drift to realize Monsanto is evil, but they are intimidated and feel isolated. We should find a way to unite, fund, and coordinate legal organizations for family farms. ( http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_65278.shtml ) Non-GMO and organic farmers have discovered this fact the hard way: There can be no co-existence with GMO and non-GMO crops. Pollen and seeds have gone beyond so-called 'buffer zones' to contaminate non-GMO crops. Conventional farmers are concerned about the biotech push for rice and wheat crops. A good part of what they grow goes to distributors who sell to foreign markets that do inspect imports for GMO contamination. They reject them even if they were inadvertently contaminated from other growers' fields. ( http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/articles/GE-rice-contamination.php ) ( http://www.nwrage.org/content/jury-awards-riceland-1368-million ) After his organic beet crop was contaminated by a nearby GMO sugar beet testing field, Chris Hardy organized others in the Rogue Valley of Jackson County, Oregon to campaign for banning GMOs in that county. ( http://www.occupymonsanto360.org ) There is precedence for this. In California, Marin and Mendocino counties have already established GMO planting bans. Get the idea? Planting must be stopped, but our federal government is too corrupt for this. Perhaps county by county and state by state, enough planting bans can be established. Other countries have had enormous victories against Monsanto : Kenya, Peru, France, Scotland, Mexico, and Brazil because farmers took a stand and their governments backed them up. There are many farmers who don't like Monsanto here in the U.S. too. But they they feel intimidated and isolated. Consumer activists here don't reach out to them. They only care about the right to choose. Farmers? What's that? Video: ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNPCV7MEo2s ) We need to back farmers up, organize them more to educate and unite other farmers. We should coordinate existing farm legal foundations and fund them more. We need to help them say no to GMO and Monsanto's contracts while supporting their lawsuits against Monsanto. ( http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_65278.shtml ) GMO planting must stop before we all are forced to play genetic roulette in a very real way no matter what the labels say.

0," Whether concern stems from the possible exposure to drifting radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan or from every day sources of non-ionizing radiation (i.e., cell phones, computers, Wi-Fi, smart meters, etc.), exposure to radiation is a reality. The constant exposure to electromagnetic fields results in DNA fragmentation which can lead to cancers of the parotid salivary gland, the thyroid gland, and the head. Kids are even more susceptible, with evidence of brain and spinal tumors appearing in children exposed to radiation. Powerwatch , a non-profit organization prominent in the United Kingdom Electromagnetic Field and Microwave Radiation health debate, shares further consequences resulting from exposure to radiation, including: Cognitive dysfunction Failed pregnancies Certain types of dementia Overtiredness Compromised immune system function Headaches Protection from radiation and its impending consequences is imperative as well as feasible through safe, natural sources. Potassium iodide Potassium iodide, simply composed of the elements potassium and iodine, is the most familiar solution for protection from radiation exposure. Potassium iodide, taken in supplement form, is also used to treat overactive thyroid. While natural, does it work? Is it safe? Potassium iodide is effective, yet contraindicated for a multitude of medications, can damage the thyroid, and brings with it other side effects in the form of: Red, bumpy, itchy skin Painful joints Facial and body swelling After using potassium iodide for a long period of time, a series of other serious health complications may also surface. The natural approach A strong, healthy thyroid is the best protection from radioactive iodine-131 (nuclear power plant steam), and EMF exposure. Steven Schacter, author of Fighting Radiation with Food, Herbs and Vitamins , explains, 'If sufficient amounts of natural iodine are available, radioactive iodine will not be absorbed.' Schacter advises eating seaweed (kelp) to obtain natural iodine. Eating foods naturally high in iodine will supply the thyroid with adequate amounts of iodine, discouraging the absorption of radioactive iodine, and protecting it from EMF damage. These foods are high in iodine and part of a natural , safe approach. Other seaweeds and sea vegetables Cranberries or cranberry juice Potatoes with the skin Beans - especially navy beans Himalayan crystal salt For protection from cancers induced from radiation eat a variety of: Dark leafy greens and orange starchy foods - (sweet potatoes, winter squash, carrots). Additional protection: Milk thistle - a proven detoxifier Siberian ginseng - facilitates overall cellular health, strengthens body against all types of stress, including cancer treatments Curcumin - antioxidant and scientifically proven anti-inflammatory, protects and helps tissue healing Ecklonia cava - antioxidant seaweed extract Drink plenty of pure water every day to eliminate toxins Visual imagery - the power of positive thinking through the visualization of wellness throughout the body Loss of minerals Radiation exposure sets the stage for the release of specific minerals from the body which are necessary for optimal protection from electromagnetic fields. These minerals are: Potassium Lithium Magnesium Copper Calcium Selenium - especially important as a co-factor of iodine for cell regeneration and protection Because the body works synergistically to heal and protect, consume a variety of organic, whole plant-based foods in a variety of colors to guarantee a good supply of antioxidants and the elimination of free radicals. Multi-vitamin supplements are a poor substitute but may be used from time to time to cover any missing nutrients. It's not practical in today's society to completely eradicate all sources of radiation; however, the best protection comes from minimizing exposure in the first place. This approach along with the others mentioned here offers the best scenario for minimizing the dangerous effects of radiation exposure. "
0," Depending on what you put in your smoothies, they can boost your daily nutrition and vitamin count considerably. Some smoothies contain foods loaded with health benefits, such as kale, flax and ingredients with omega-3 fatty acids that are highly recommended for good health. Boost your daily nutrition intake - and your health - with smoothies: Omega-3s don't just come from fish Nutritionists recommend you get omega-3s from fish, fish oils and supplements, but there are other sources. One is by drinking milk and eating dairy products made from the milk of cows that are fed only a grass diet. In addition to dairy products from grass fed cows, beef from cows that have been raised on the diet nature intended for them - grass - is also a solid source of omega-3s. Another source for omega-3s is walnuts. One smoothie recipe contains two kinds of fruit, almond milk, cranberry juice and walnut oil and is loaded with omega-3s. So, if you don't like the taste of fish, there are other ways to get those same health benefits. A smoothie made with milk from grass fed cows or almond milk with a tablespoon of walnut oil added will be loaded with omega-3s. Get your daily recommended servings of veggies Other smoothie recipes are designed to help people get their recommended vegetable intake. If you have trouble eating all the vegetables that health experts and the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommend we eat each day, which is three to five servings a day, you can get all of them in one smoothie . Even if you like the taste of vegetables, you may still have trouble eating all that is recommended, so a veggie smoothie is the way to go. One such recipe starts with a cup of filtered water, a carrot, a cucumber, a handful of spinach leaves, a slice of a beet, and a tomato. This one contains the entire rainbow color spectrum that is also recommended by nutritionists. Veggie smoothies for those who don't like vegetables Kids and adults who don't like the taste of vegetables can also get their recommended daily vegetable intake while disguising the taste of the vegetables with other ingredients. Some smoothie recipes of this type mix the vegetables with fruits and honey or other natural sweeteners, utilizing the Mary Poppins' principle that 'a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.' These smoothies still pack a healthy load of vitamin power and get vegetables in the diets of those who simply refuse to eat them. Breakfast smoothies when you're on the go Some people drink smoothies as a way to eat breakfast on the go, such as drinking from a travel mug in the car, on the bus or on the subway. Breakfast smoothies are a way to get someone to eat breakfast who isn't particularly hungry in the morning, and doesn't like to take time to eat anything. Nutrients contained in a breakfast smoothie made from milk (almond or milk from grass fed cows), a ripe banana, cocoa powder and peanut butter has everything you need for a healthy breakfast. Add a few ice cubes to the blender to make the consistency more like that of a milk shake. "
0," A California father's desperate quest to find a viable solution to his young son's rare form of epilepsy has led him to incredible success in medicinal marijuana. The Los Angeles Times (LAT) reports that Jason David's son Jayden now functions normally, eats solid food, and takes only four prescription medications for his condition rather than the 22 he had been taking prior to starting the cannabis protocol. Young Jayden suffers from an extremely rare, and potentially fatal, epileptic condition known as Dravet syndrome that is categorized as a 'catastrophic form of intractable epilepsy.' For Jayden, symptoms of the condition have included things like intense 'grand mal' seizure fits, continuous muscle twitching, inability to respond to or interact with others, difficulty chewing, and frequent screaming episodes. According to Jayden's father Jason, Jayden had spent most of his life either sleeping or seizing, which put incredible strain on the family as it unsuccessfully tried using prescription drug after prescription drug to at least ease Jayden's symptoms. But Jayden's condition only got progressively worse in response to pharmaceuticals , which led Jason to actually consider committing suicide as he says he simply could no longer bear watching his son suffer in this horrific way. After praying intensely about the situation and meeting with their local religious congregation for guidance; however, the Davids stumbled upon medical marijuana, and particularly cannabidiol (CBD), one of the many cannabinoid compounds naturally found in certain varieties of marijuana. Following a period of heavy research into the history and effectiveness of CBD, Jason decided it was worth giving the treatment a try with his son -- and upon doing so, the Davids observed an almost immediate improvement in Jayden's condition. 'Unlike the dominant THC, cannabidiol is not psychoactive, so the sweet-tasting infusion Jayden takes four times a day doesn't make him high,' writes Lee Romney for LAT about this miracle healer. 'CBD ... was virtually bred out of U.S. plants decades ago by growers whose customers preferred the mind-altering properties of high-THC varietals. Yet it is experiencing a resurgence, having shown promise as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, neuroprotectant and cancer-fighting agent.' Today, Jayden is a fairly healthy, well-functioning little boy that is able to eat solid foods, play and interact with his dad and friends, and dance around the house while singing his favorite tunes. And this was all made possible not by Western medicine, but by Jayden's parents' willingness to ignore the federal government's unjustified bias against medical marijuana, a natural substance that is proving to be far more effective at treating a variety of serious illnesses than anything the drug industry has to offer. The time is NOW to end prohibition against medical cannabis The powerful way in which medical marijuana has benefited young Jayden even in the relatively short amount of time that he has been taking it is just the tip of the iceberg as far as marijuana's full medicinal capacity is concerned. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of chronic health conditions that respond well to treatment with cannabinoids. But because the federal government refuses to remove marijuana from its Schedule 1 Controlled Substances list, the plant's full medicinal potential may never be fully realized , and millions of people will continue to needlessly suffer and die from conditions that could be effectively cured -- yes, cured -- through its safe use. Be sure to check out this amazing report that explains a little more about how the human body is basically designed for cannabinoids, as cannabinoid receptors throughout the body use these important substances to regulate immunity, normalize and balance the systems of the body, and facilitate proper cell communication: http://www.selfnews.com/035759_cannabis_juicing_health.html "
0," Following are three powerful practices from ancient oriental medicine that will serve your health and well-being. 1. THE HUMAN BODY POSSESSES A PROFOUND AND POWERFUL REGENERATIVE CHEMISTRY. PRESUME THAT POWER UNDER ALL CONDITIONS Time and time again serious diseases are suddenly and irrevocably reversed. These extraordinary healings demonstrate the immense power of the body's ability to rejuvenate itself. The traditional medical systems of China, India and Tibet are all based on the observation that the body will heal itself when it is brought back into balance. We should, therefore do whatever is practically necessary to bring the body back into healing balance, but we should never meditate on the disease. We should presume and meditate on the power of this healing chemistry instead. One of the common factors that we see in examples of extraordinary healing is the ability to transcend the power and mood of the named disease and to presume instead the body's power to rejuvenate. Visualize this power everyday and read healing stories to inspire and magnify this rejuvenative disposition. 2. CULTIVATE THE BLOOD EVERYDAY Right cultivation of the blood is key to longevity. Dracula understood this principle. We should boost the body's production of blood, and increase the blood circulation every day. This ensures that there is an abundant supply of blood to feed all the organs and cells of the body. It also ensures that our circulatory system remains open and freely flowing. When blood production becomes weak, the blood pathways shrink, the possibility of cardio vascular disease increases. Eat blood building foods everyday like dark greens and brown rice mochi, and breathe deeply during your daily exercise regime. Nature provides us with powerful blood building herbs. Angelica Sinensis, Peony, Rehmannia, Ligusticum, Yellow Dock, promote blood production while herbs such as Hawthorne, Safflower, and Salvia are extremely effective at eliminating areas of blood stagnation that result in imbalance and disease if left unattended. 3. PROTECT THE DEEPER YIN The Chinese law of aging is as follows: 'The yang consumes the yin.' The fire of life activity uses up the deep, moist, living essences of the body . Therefore, we should serve to nourish and refresh this living essence every day. Beyond the age of 45, this practice should be absolute. When the yin levels get low, people overheat, they can't sleep and inflammation increases. Do not let this yin deficiency persist for too long. Do not allow the moist, cooling, living substratum of the body to dry out because it quickens our decline. This deep yin is refreshed in deep relaxation, meditation, and deep sleep. Eat lots of cooling cleansing foods like dark greens, avocados and vegetable soups. Nature provides medicines for this too. Herbs like Rehmannia, Lycium, Solomon Seal are loaded with molecules similar to the deep essence of our bodies. Use them on a regular basis. Anyone can quickly adapt to these three simple practices to good effect. Their greatest virtue and power will be shown over time.

0," Protein is the name given to a group of large, complex molecules that form the basis of tissues in living organisms. These groups, which consist of one or more long chains of amino acid residues, perform a huge number of essential roles in our bodies, including aiding the growth and repair of cells, maintaining immune function and much more. When we are deficient in protein, we begin to suffer from fatigue, slow healing, muscle atrophy and other unpleasant symptoms. Therefore, it's important that we obtain enough protein from our diets to remain in optimal health. But which whole foods contain the highest amounts of this essential macronutrient? Though opinions on this subject differ, the following foods tend to provide the highest protein-calorie ratio. The best sources of protein Chicken -- There's a good reason why chicken is a popular food with bodybuilders. One average-sized chicken breast supplies our bodies with a whopping 17 grams of protein, making it one of the most protein-dense foods in existence. The legs and thighs of the chicken are also packed with protein, as well as large amounts of selenium, niacin, vitamin B6 and phosphorous. Of course, the meat of chickens raised on organic, sustainable farms is the healthiest. If you are going to stick with non-organic chicken, consider removing the skin from the meat; this is where the toxins accumulate. Fish -- Most fish is an excellent source of protein, but salmon, tuna, snapper and halibut seem to be particularly rich sources of it. One fillet of each contains around 22 grams of protein , while perch, flounder, sole, cod and tilapia contain between 17 to 21 grams of it. Fish is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which keep our heart and brain healthy, as well as vitamin D, riboflavin, calcium and magnesium. Sadly, not all fish is safe to eat these days due to the ongoing contamination of our oceans. To minimize the risk of toxicity, favor sustainably caught fish sourced from the Atlantic Ocean when possible. Pork -- One pork chop provides 33 grams of protein, which is more than half of the recommended daily intake of protein for adult women (46 grams) and adult men (56 grams). Other pork products, such as pork roast, ham and bacon, are also good sources of protein. Pigs are widely considered to be dirty animals, and for good reasons. Aside from digesting their food in a mere 4 hours (compared to 24 hours in ruminant animals), pigs lack the sweat glands necessary for detoxification, making them walking vessels of harmful organisms. For this reason, pork should always be purchased from reputable organic farms. Beef -- Though red meat tends to contain a lower protein-calorie ratio than white meat, it's still famously rich in protein. One T-bone steak, for instance, supplies us with around 19 grams of protein, as well as large amounts of bio-available iron, zinc and vitamin B12. Even processed beef products, such as beef jerky, contain respectable amounts of protein. Eggs -- One large egg contains 6 grams of protein, making eggs one of the finest protein sources for vegetarians. Though most of this protein is contained in the white, don't forget to eat the yolk too; this is where the other essential nutrients, including the vision-boosting carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin are held. Greek yogurt -- According to Bodybuilding.com , an 8-ounce serving of Greek yogurt supplies us with 23 grams of protein, making it the most concentrated dairy source of protein. Greek yogurt, which has been strained to remove its whey content, is also a fantastic source of probiotics. Favor organic, unsweetened brands when possible. Other great whole food sources of protein include unprocessed cheeses, legumes, nuts, seeds, certain gluten-free grains (such as buckwheat and quinoa), spirulina and chlorella.

0," Connecting the dots between the writers of pro-agrichemical pseudo-journalistic pieces and the funding that fuels their endless propaganda isn't always easy work. But thanks to the efforts of the U.S. Right to Know group, which advocates for mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) , we now have the inside scoop about a few prominent journalists who have apparently sold their souls to the chemical industry in exchange for a cash payout. A new report focuses on three individuals in particular Amy Harmon, Keith Kloor and Tamar Haspel all of whom seem to support the unmitigated use of unlabeled GMOs in the food supply , and who also can't understand why people oppose hidden biotechnology in their food. The reason for these positions, of course, is that all of these individuals are bankrolled by the biotech industry , and now we have solid proof. 1) Amy Harmon is a reporter for The New York Times (NYT), and has won several awards for her work in 'explanatory reporting.' She's also connected to the infamous Jon Entine of Forbes.com , who we earlier reported is a domestic abuser and a discredited apologist for GMOs and crop chemicals . Entine actually mentioned Harmon's name in an email exchange, noting that: 'I think I've talked Amy Harmon into doing a Hawaii Hawaii story... and I gave her your and Kirby's email information, so she may call at some point if she indeed pursues this.' The email was sent to a woman by the name of Renee Kester, and refers to Kirby Kester, the president of an agrichemical industry front group by the name of 'Hawaii Crop Improvement Association.' Not long after this exchange, Harmon published a story in the NYT supposedly setting the record straight on GMO safety all it really was, though, was a shill piece promoting GMOs. Harmon was also asked to speak at a conference funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which was also intends to promote the use of GMOs. 2) Keith Kloor is a freelance journalist who has written for a number of popular news outlets including Slate , Nature and Science Insider . His many pro-GMO articles have also appeared on Jon Entine's website Genetic Literacy Project , which is a pro-Monsanto front resource espouses corporate talking points to support GMOs. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents obtained by U.S. Right to Know reveal that Kloor is a 'very good friend' of Entine's, as well as other pro-GMO shills who work on behalf of corporations like Monsanto to defend the reputation of GMOs and crop chemicals. Based on an email sent to Kloor and a number of other pro-GMO advocates back in 2014, it is clear that he is very closely aligned with the industry. The email, which was sent by pro-GMO advocate Dr. Channapatna Prakash, included Kloor as the only journalist in the chain. Other recipients of the email included names like Henry Miller, Kevin Folta, and others we've recently exposed for pro-GMO corruption. 3) Tamar Haspel is a columnist with The Washington Post who has repeatedly published articles praising GMOs. Her work has also appeared in Entine's Genetic Literacy Project database. Haspel participated in a conference coordinated by John Entine and his colleague Cami Ryan, and was led by the Genetic Literacy Project and Academics Review, another agrichemical front group. When asked about her financial relationship with the industry which she has repeatedly endorsed through her work, Haspel said, 'I speak and moderate panels and debates often, and it's work I'm paid for.' When asked precisely how much money she's received, she replied, 'Since any group believing biotech has something to offer is a 'front group,' plenty!' "
0," Based on all available reports at this time, it appears that the Japanese government has been severely downplaying the very real radiation threat the Japanese people face in the wake of the 9.1 magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami that occurred last Friday, which has left tens of thousands of people dead and missing, and numerous towns and cities in ruin. But now, a report has surfaced claiming that the Japanese government has been lying to those living close to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor and pretending that the impending meltdown is not a significant threat. Mayor Katsunobu Sakurai, Mayor of Minamisoma, population 71,000, says that immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, government officials ignored his calls asking for advice on how to handle the situation. Minamisoma, which sits a mere 12 miles downwind from the Fukushima plant, was devastated by the tsunami, and many of its residents are still missing, according to a recent report in the UK Daily Mail . When Sakurai was finally able to get through to officials days after the disaster, they assured him there was nothing to worry about -- this despite the fact that the radioactive plumes being released from the Fukushima plant are literally visible with the naked eye when peering northwest out of the Minamisoma. So being a trusting man, Sakurai believed them and consequently did not instruct his people to evacuate. But when Sakurai finally discovered that authorities were deliberately withholding the true severity of the nuclear fallout situation from both him and the people of Minamisoma, he was outraged. His city is just outside the government's recommended radius for evacuation, but is still close enough to be harmed by radiation. He told reporter David Jones from the Daily Mail the following, via an interpreter: 'Of course I am angry. I was ignored and then badly misled, and as a result the people were abandoned here to die. But I was the one who told them it was safe to stay, and now I have decided that I must be the last person to leave this city. I have been in my office since last Friday, and I won't go until the last person has left safely.' This deliberate act of defiant, but courageous, action is likely to be followed by many others in surrounding towns and cities that are coming to realize that the Japanese government , for whatever reason, is not telling people the whole truth about the reactor and its dangers. Hopefully by the time they do take action, it will not be already be too late for them. It is important to note that the same officials who have been lying to the Japanese people are also telling the world that the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors is under control, and that radiation levels are minimal. But based on their track record of honesty, can we honestly just take their word for it at this point? Even though roughly half of Minamisoma's 71,000 people are said to have been evacuated as of the evening of March 17, there is no telling whether or not the levels of radiation they have already been exposed to within the past few several days will cause them any immediate or long-term damage. Our heart go out to them as they seek shelter and safety from the radioactive nightmare brewing right before their eyes. The Daily Mail has some amazing photos of the situation in Minamisoma that you can view here: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367...

0," My colleague Jake Eagle of Green Psychology, author of the popular free e-book Why Smart People Struggle to be Happy , once related the following: In the world of mental health and psychotherapy -- as well as many other places -- we often talk about ourselves as if we're made up of a bunch of different parts. We have mature parts and immature parts, wounded parts and angry parts, embarrassed parts and scared parts. It's remarkably common to hear people in everyday conversations referring to parts of themselves. In the world of psychotherapy it's actually an intentional strategy we use to help people acknowledge some of their negative behaviors without labeling the entire person in a negative way. In essence, we excuse or justify many negative behaviors by ascribing them to a part of the person, while reassuring the person that we still think that they're a good human being. Therapists do this for many reasons. 1) They don't even think about it. They simply grew up within this worldview that I'm calling the 'parts model,' and they never even question it. They think it's real. 2) They use the parts model to help clients face aspects of themselves that the clients are critical of. The therapist might say, 'Well, part of you was nasty, but another part of you feels guilty about it, which goes to show that you're not just a nasty person.' 3) Some therapists use the parts model as a developmental tool, as a way to help people begin to take more responsibility for themselves. It's kind of like the answer to the question, 'How do you eat an elephant,' which is, 'One bite at a time.' When clients deny responsibility for their actions, using the parts model is a way to slowly get them to take more personal responsibility. When speaking to a client who denies he's angry, the therapist says, 'But isn't it true that part of you is angry?' The client then may be able to ease into acknowledging his or her feelings with this kind of help from the parts model. There are entire therapies built on the foundation of the parts model. Clients will sometimes be asked to move from chair A to chair B to chair C. In each chair they are supposed to give voice to some different part of themselves. There have been some very impressive case studies of the effectiveness in using the parts model to cure bulimia, to release traumatic memories, and to help clients access powerful resources. The parts model is one way to help clients develop understanding, empathy, and compassion for themselves and others. When people feel bad about themselves, it can be helpful to separate, or distance themselves, from the part that they feel bad about so that they can see 'this is not all of who I am.' Although I can make an argument that the parts model is appropriate at certain stages of development, like when working with people who simply aren't yet ready to take full responsibility for themselves, I can also make the argument that the parts model is what keeps people from fully growing up and being able to take responsibility for themselves. When people refer to parts of themselves, they are distancing themselves from themselves.They say things like: There is part of me that feels unworthy of love. I have a very young and wounded part of me that has a hard time making commitments. There is a part of me that doesn't fully trust you. I'm sorry I said what I did, but I have an immature part that occasionally acts out. What if it's all made up -- the entire idea that we have parts? What if we are 100% whole? We are an accumulation of all of our life experiences and we are the age we are today. So when we behave immaturely, we don't get to point to the 'immature part' of ourselves. Instead, we step up and acknowledge, 'I was immature.' What if instead of promoting the idea that I have a 'scared five-year-old part of me,' I just say, 'I'm scared,' or even more accurately, 'I'm scaring myself.' Is this notion of parts helping us, or are we holding ourselves back with this idea? What I believe is that if we demand more of ourselves, if we demand we behave maturely, we don't need to rely on the parts model. If instead of relying on the parts model to explain behavior, we just ask people to behave in responsible and mature ways, what would happen? I can tell you that at this point in my life the parts model does not seem useful. It's seems like a veil to hide behind. It distracts me from what's happening in the moment because I start looking to explain myself based on my parts. So I've stopped doing that. Instead, I just ask myself, 'How would I like to behave in this situation?' And then, for the most part, that's what I do. "
0," The 'dynamic duo' BHA and BHT, both used to preserve products and fight fungus, have both been linked to allergic reactions, hyperactivity, rashes, asthma, and other health problems. In studies BHT has caused various disorders in animals, such as reduced body weight, increased blood cholesterol levels, and birth defects. America is consuming mass amounts of chemicals put in foods and drinks. Both BHA and BHT are carcinogens that are prominent in potato-chips, cookies, cakes, carbonated drinks, chewing gum, shortening, lard, vegetable oils, margarine, cheese spreads, ice cream, dry cereals, cosmetics, and medical drugs. If you see the phrases, 'as a preservative' or 'for added freshness,' you can be sure it's for your own good, right? Wrong. In the United States of America, carcinogens like BHA & BHT (butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene) are widely used to preserve freshness, keep foods from going rancid, and prolong product shelf life, all while trading in consumer health and wellness for wider profit margins . The FDA is just like the huge corporations that do not care about American health, so don't be surprised to find out that BHA and BHT are synthetically manufactured, petroleum-based and fat-soluble . How many products in your pantry, refrigerator and cosmetic cabinet have these 'preservatives?' Maybe you should go take a count. Not to be confused with antioxidants that boost immunity, BHA & BHT are food criminals wearing friendly masks, but nutritionally educated consumers are waking up to the new era, where healthy buzz words and phrases like natural flavors, all natural, antioxidant, as a preservative, and for added freshness are stamped on just about anything, with no regulations for such chemical agents posing as food. BHT is banned in England because research shows it reacts with other ingested substances to cause the formation of carcinogens. BHA is listed as a carcinogen by the state of California because it causes cancer in humans. BHA has been banned in Japan because studies found it causes cancerous tumors in rats stomachs. Both BHA and BHT are toxic to the liver and kidneys . Remember, humans are animals too. Human lymph nodes absorb these toxins, and that's why breast cancer numbers have gone through the roof. Looking for alternatives? Don't trust anything the FDA approves . Stick with high quality vegetable oil, like cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, and buy only fresh fruits and vegetables that do not need additives.

0," The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has officially released its 2015 Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce , giving people all across the country the opportunity to make smarter purchasing decisions when shopping for produce. The free report, which is issued annually, contains a list of the top 15 cleanest fruits and vegetables based on tests conducted by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), as well as an outline of the worst 12 when it comes to contamination with pesticides and herbicides. These 'Clean Fifteen' and 'Dirty Dozen' lists are available in a free PDF file that you can download and print out as a handy guide to use while shopping. You can access the free 2015 Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce here: EWG.org . Avoid conventional apples, peaches, nectarines, potatoes, grapes, peppers and strawberries Based on 3,015 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2013, the data from which was used to compile the new report, a shocking two-thirds were found to contain pesticide residues. Among these samples, more than 165 different pesticides were identified, despite increasing consumer demand for chemical-free produce. Even when washed and/or peeled, many of the fruits and vegetables tested were still found to contain high levels of pesticide chemicals, some more than others. Conventional apples, peaches and nectarines were found to be the worst when it comes to chemical contamination. '99 percent of apple samples, 98 percent of peaches, and 97 percent of nectarines tested positive for at least one pesticide residue,' states a key finding from the report. The average potato was found to be even worse, containing more pesticides by weight than any other produce item tested. A single grape sample and a sweet bell pepper sample were also each found to contain an astounding 15 different pesticides, while single samples of cherry tomatoes, nectarines, peaches, imported snap peas and strawberries all contained 13 different pesticides each. Print out EWG's helpful shopper's guide and use it while shopping for produce Depending on where you live, even shopping at farmers' markets for produce won't necessarily protect you from these imperceptible poisons. Unless a farmer explicitly states that he or she doesn't use pesticides , or grows and sells only certified organic produce, you're probably consuming harmful chemicals every time you attempt to be healthy by eating more 'fresh' produce. On the flip side, avocados, regardless of whether or not they're organic, are typically free of chemicals. Only 1 percent of avocado samples tested showed any detectable pesticides. Similarly, 89 percent of pineapples, 88 percent of mangoes, 82 percent of kiwis, 80 percent of papayas and 61 percent of cantaloupes showed no chemical contamination. 'No single fruit sample from the Clean Fifteen tested positive for more than 4 types of pesticides,' explains EWG. 'Multiple pesticide residues are extremely rare on Clean Fifteen vegetables. Only 5.5 percent of Clean Fifteen samples had two or more pesticides.' The two lists are as follows: Dirty Dozen Apples Celery Cherry Tomatoes Cucumbers Grapes Nectarines Peaches Potatoes Snap Peas Spinach Strawberries Sweet Bell Peppers Hot Peppers & Kale/Collard Greens Clean Fifteen Asparagus Avocados Cabbage Cantaloupe Cauliflower Eggplant Grapefruit Kiwi Mangoes Onions Papayas Pineapples Sweet Corn Sweet Peas (frozen) Sweet Potatoes You can download a free PDF of these two lists for easy access by visiting: EWG.org .

0," Bill Nye, 'the science guy,' has a word of advice for those who cherish life he believes there should be no laws protecting life or property because 'you can't tell people what to do.' In a new video, Bill Nye defends Planned Parenthood and the illegal sale of organs harvested meticulously from the wombs of women and sold to biotech companies. Women deserve to be given better choices and treated with greater dignity. They don't deserve to have their emotions and bodies abused, while their next of kin is harvested from them and sold. In the video, Bill Nye reasons that abortion should remain legally convenient and taxpayer-funded because there's no way of stopping people from doing what they want. 'Nobody likes abortion but you can't tell somebody what to do. She has rights over this,' he said. With this kind of misguided reasoning, Bill Nye apparently believes that people have the right to hurt other people, because 'you can't tell them what to do.' In Bill Nye's world, public policy should expedite violence, encourage harm and make organ harvesting seem normal. There is no moral standard in his eyes, no mercy and no justice. He is literally advocating a more violent world. Since 'you can't tell people what to do' anyway, they can always rape, kill or destroy each other's property. Bill Nye doesn't care. He doesn't believe in the rule of law. To Nye, it doesn't matter if science can measure a beating heart by ultrasound at 6 weeks gestation. He doesn't care if the fetus is viable and capable of living outside the womb at 24 weeks. It doesn't matter if life has been conceived at all, fully capable of going full term with his/her own unique DNA from two parents. It doesn't matter if Planned Parenthood pathologists crack the skull of a living fetus and harvest organs to sell to a biotech company. He thinks 'We have so many more important things to be dealing with.' His lack of sensitivity toward human life and utter disregard for the rule of law are exactly why humanity is suffering today. Nye thinks that there should be no definition of personhood and no line drawn to protect the most vulnerable among us. Instead, he attacks Christians and Jews for their dedication to Biblical principles. He stereotypes anyone who cherishes life and distorts their beliefs by saying, 'I'm sorry guys. Your interpretation of a book written 5000 years ago... makes you think that when a man and a woman have sexual intercourse they always have a baby. That's wrong. So to pass laws based on that belief is inconsistent with nature.' He proudly states that the pro-life position is based on a 'deep scientific lack of understanding.' 'You cannot help but notice... you have a lot of men of European descent passing all these extraordinary laws based on ignorance,' he said. 'You apparently literally don't know what you are talking about,' he said. Since the 1970s, over 56.66 million fetuses have been sacrificed, never getting a chance to even become viable outside the womb, let alone grow into fully formed infants, children and adults. Abortion has become so accessible and so convenient, but Bill Nye would rather deflect from the heart of the matter. 'Many, many, many more hundreds of eggs are fertilized than become humans,' he says, because not all of those eggs will attach to a woman's uterine wall and result in pregnancy. 'But if you're going to hold that as a standard that life begins at conception and any egg that's fertilized has the same rights as an individual well, whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison?' he asks. 'Every woman who has had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy whose sperm has fertilized an egg and then it didn't become a human?' In reality, cherishing life is NOT about 'telling people what to do.' Cherishing life is NOT about jailing women for abortions and condemning their past decisions. Cherishing life is about working together to encourage healthy relationships and responsible reproductive decisions. It's about bringing more options to the forefront so care is encouraged for the most vulnerable in the womb. Cherishing life is about the responsibility of reproduction. It's about encouraging healthy relationships. As long as the illegal trafficking of fetal organs continues at Planned Parenthood, women won't be empowered. They will be misled and coerced into abortions that affect them on an emotional level for years to come. As Bill Nye and Planned Parenthood cling to their ego, with no hope for humanity, a growing number of people are learning that there are better ways available that treat women, men and the most vulnerable in society with utmost dignity, love and care.

0," Life in the 21st century is full of stress and environmental toxicity. We have over 80,000 toxic chemicals in our surrounding environment that we interact with regularly. A lifestyle of daily detoxifying strategies and periodic cleansing periods is essential to health in the modern world. Bentonite clay is a perfect detoxifying agent with remarkable health benefits. A healthy cell must be able to excrete waste material on a consistent basis. When toxins build up faster than they can be eliminated, it causes major problems. Many of the symptoms of toxic bioaccumulation include brain fog, dizziness, headaches, sluggishness, chronic fatigue, trouble sleeping, skin problems, hormone issues, digestive problems etc. The history of man and animal consuming clay: Clay and dirt are substances that have been used for thousands of years by indigenous people around the world, including our ancient ancestors. In fact, over 200 cultures worldwide eat dirt on a daily basis. In Europe, it is widely used to aid digestion and for anti-aging benefits. Every animal eats dirt and clay on a regular basis. Animals consume clay instinctively in the form of mud. Animals lick the dirt or mud and also will roll in it, especially when injured in order to obtain relief. They will also search for clay after ingesting herbs loaded with toxic substances. Bentonite clay alkalizes and detoxifies the body: Bentonite clay provides a great medium as a detoxification treatment, because it is safe and highly effective. Clay has an alkaline pH and high negative ionic charge that act as powerful antioxidants. These attributes allow bentonite clay to help alkalize the body and pull toxic pathogens and environmental toxins out of the body cleanly. Clay is a grouping of super charged minerals that are lying inert. They get their negative electromagnetic charge from the thermodynamic heat that created the clay many years earlier. When combined with water, the clay gains strength and energizes the body when consumed. It also has the ability to adsorb an enormous amount of toxins as a sponge-like magnet and carry them out of the body. Clay has a magnetic affinity for heavy metals, viruses and intestinal parasites among other things. The energy of the clay stimulates the revitalization and rebuilding of damaged cells and tissues. Taking in clay internally helps to adsorb many times its weight in water and grab up toxins along the way. Clay baths utilize clay's strong drawing powers to help pull toxic debris out through the pores of the skin. Through a pulsing action, clay will pull out infectious organisms, heavy metals and other major toxins. The safety of using clay: Bentonite clay is one of the safest, easiest and least expensive detoxifying substances one could find. It is noninvasive and causes no harm when used correctly. Many people notice a huge reduction in pain, irritation and inflammation upon using bentonite clay even after other methods have offered no relief. Clay is extremely absorbent, so it draws toxic substances and swells to many times its size in water. Clay acts like a magnet, and more is definitely not better. Start with just 1 tsp in water until you are able to effectively tolerate it. Do not use clay with any pharmaceutical or homeopathic therapies. The action of clay is inhibited by medication, and the clay can also adsorb the energies of the drug or homeopathic remedy. Clay should be ingested on an empty stomach at the beginning or end of the day. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to ensure you are getting the full benefits of the clay. "
0," What the U.S. Air Force and the CIA are doing in the skies around the world, the U.S. Navy wants to do under the seas: patrol them with weaponized drones. Over the holiday season, the Navy recently pushed forward with a plan to build a fleet of 'long endurance, transoceanic gliders harvesting all energy from the ocean thermocline,' according to a dispatch from the sea service. In other words, underwater drones that derive their power from the ocean itself. As reported by Time : And you thought Jules Verne died in 1905. Fact is, the Navy has been seeking - pretty much under the surface - a way to do underwater what the Air Force has been doing in the sky: prowl stealthily for long periods of time, and gather the kind of data that could turn the tide in war. Weaponized and undersea, these 'gliders' will be valuable - and lethal Now, the Navy's not calling its vehicles 'drones.' Rather, as noted by the service's dispatch, they will be called 'gliders,' and they will be sent on roller-coaster-like paths for up to five years at a time. The Navy envisions a fleet of them being capable of swarming an enemy's coastline during times of conflict, helping surface ships and other combatants locate mines and enemy subs. And one of the best innovations is that the gliders won't be powered by traditional energy sources - that is, fossil fuels. 'Instead, they draw energy from the ocean's thermocline, a pair of layers of warm water near the surface and chillier water below,' Time reports. Here is how the gliders will work: The glider changes its density, relative to the outside water, causing the 5-foot (1.5m)-long torpedo-like vehicle to either rise or sink - a process called hydraulic buoyancy. Its stubby wings translate some of that up-and-down motion into a forward speed of about a mile (1.6 km) an hour in a sawtooth pattern. As it regularly approaches the surface, an air bladder in the tail inflates to stick an antenna out of the water so it can transmit what it has learned to whatever Captain Nemo dispatched it to the depths. A great deal of the work that the gliders will likely perform will be oceanic in nature, the Navy says. That means collecting data about water temperature, salinity, currents, eddies and clarity. That kind of information is crucial for calibrating sonar, so that it can provide the best and most accurate underwater portrait possible. And there are already efforts to develop ways in which that data can be incorporated into information that will be handy for military purposes. Early testing looks promising When announcing its contract recently, the Navy added only a couple hundred thousand dollars to an existing contract it has with Teledyne Benthos, Inc., for additional 'research efforts' into its Slocum Gliders, so named for Capt. Joshua Slocum, who sailed around the world by himself in a 37-foot sloop between 1895 and 1898. 'Carrying a wide variety of sensors, they can be programmed to patrol for weeks at a time, surfacing to transmit their data to shore while downloading new instructions at regular intervals, realizing a substantial cost savings compared to traditional surface ships,' the company's Webb Research division says. In 2009, Time reported, the Navy issued a $56.2 million contract for up to 150 of the 'Littoral Battlespace-sensing' undersea gliders to be delivered beginning in 2014. The Navy wants to invest in undersea drone technology, because the information that such craft can gather will be vital 'for mine countermeasures and other tasks important to expeditionary warfare...ultimately reducing or eliminating the need for sailors and Marines to enter the dangerous shallow waters just off shore in order to clear mines in preparation for expeditionary operations.' Navy officials have said the gliders have already proved viable in sea trials. Sources: http://swampland.time.com http://rt.com http://www.huffingtonpost.com "
0," People who get health information from the Internet are significantly more likely to feel like their choices can affect their risk of acquiring cancer, according to a study conducted by researchers from Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania , and published in the Journal of Communication . A fatalistic attitude about cancer prevention is widespread in U.S. society, with many believing that only fate or luck determine who gets cancer and who doesn't. This fatalism can lead people to neglect proven cancer-prevention strategies, and to make poor health choices if they do receive a cancer diagnosis 'Reducing cancer fatalism, especially among people with low socioeconomic status, is arguably one of the most important public health goals in the nation,' researcher Chul-joo Lee said. 'Studying the effect of Internet use on cancer fatalism is important, considering that the Internet has become a new, very crucial source of health information for the American public these days.' Prior studies have shown that people who view local television programming become increasingly fatalistic in their cancer outlooks over time, but no comparable studies had been conducted on Internet use. In order to determine whether Internet use was related to cancer fatalism, the researchers conducted a nationally representative survey of 2,489 US adults between the ages of 40 and 70. Internet use and attitudes about cancer were monitored over the course of a year, and the findings were adjusted for age, census religion, education, ethnicity and gender. Greatest benefit for the poor and less-educated The researchers found that people who regularly get health or medical information from the Internet are significantly less likely to hold fatalistic attitudes about cancer prevention and diagnosis than people who do not use the Internet in that way. Strikingly, this effect was only seen 'among those with average and lower than the average levels of education and health knowledge.' The effects were strongest in the poor and in people with less education and health knowledge. 'These findings have important implications since we showed that the Internet may be a very effective channel of health communication especially for people with low socioeconomic status,' the researchers wrote. The findings may help guide public-health efforts to better inform people about cancer prevention, the researchers suggested. 'Given the importance of [the] public information environment in cancer control, it is theoretically and practically important to explore how people's media use to acquire health information influences their beliefs about cancer prevention,' they wrote. Health outcomes affected People's attitude about cancer prevention and diagnosis can have serious health consequences. For example, a 2010 study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that Latina women who hold fatalistic attitudes about cancer or illness are significantly less likely to get screened for cervical, breast and colorectal cancer. This was true even after researchers controlled for the effect of poverty or limited access to healthcare. Latina women have the lowest cancer screening rates in the country and are also among the most likely to believe that cancer cannot be prevented or treated.

0," The latest statistics show that the deadly street drug heroin is now responsible for killing more people in New York City than homicides , a startling fact that's sparking fresh concerns about what some fear might be a 'comeback' of the use of this crude opiate drug. But comparatively speaking, more New Yorkers are dying from the use of everyday pain medications than they are from heroin or homicides, based on national statistics, an even more concerning fact. The New York Daily News (NYDN) recently reported that, based on 2013 data (which is the latest available), heroin overdoses killed 420 people, compared to the 335 people that were murdered in NYC during the same year. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the prevalence of heroin in the Big Apple is supposedly higher now than it was even during the epidemics of the 1970s and 1980s (which could just be the agency trying to legitimize its existence amidst the rapid legalization of cannabis nationwide). In any case, the point is that heroin-related deaths now outpace homicides in the city that never sleeps, and some media sources are up in arms about this. And yet these same media sources are oddly silent about the more than 16,000 people that die every year in the U.S. as a result of prescription painkiller use , which translated to the population of NYC represents more deaths than the number associated with either homicide or heroin. Roughly eight people die in NYC from some kind of pharmaceutical for every one person murdered According to a 2014 report issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 46 people die every single day in America as a result of painkiller overdoses, a figure that is far higher than the number of heroin overdoses being reported in NYC . The population of NYC is about 8.5 million people, or just over 2.6% of the national population. If you divide this out, this translates to about 442 deaths every year in NYC from prescription painkillers . These are just the reported deaths , of course -- many pharmaceutical-related deaths don't even make it into the system and are blamed on other causes, so the actual number is likely far higher. But it still demonstrates how the media's up-in-arms response to the number of deaths associated with crude opiate use (heroin) is hypocritical in light of the many more deaths associated with prescription heroin (opioid painkiller) use. This same CDC report notes that more than 12 million Americans now use prescription painkillers on a regular basis, with the bulk of this use in Southern states like Alabama and West Virginia (followed closely by several Midwest states). It also highlights how prescription painkillers now kill more people across the board than the number of deaths associated with both heroin and cocaine combined! Interestingly, these statistics only look at the number of deaths associated with one class of drugs -- prescription painkillers. When you cover the full gamut of pharmaceutical offerings, the death rate is substantially higher , likely topping 100,000 deaths annually and possibly more , based on statistics gathered and compiled in the book Our Daily Meds by Melody Petersen. Translated just to NYC, this suggests more than 2,600 pharmaceutical-related deaths among New Yorkers every year, or roughly eight pharmaceutical-related deaths in NYC for every one homicide . This is a staggering comparison that illustrates once again how the legal drug cartel is among the most dangerous industries in the country.

0," Something sinister in the modern era is destroying the bodies and minds of today's children at an accelerating rate -- and no, it isn't better diagnoses or other such lame excuses peddled by the media. People today, especially in the U.S., are increasingly overweight, chronically fatigued, perpetually brain 'fogged,' and in a growing number of cases regressively unable to function normally or interact socially due to inexplicable mental problems and neurological disorders. The autism rate, as a highly relevant example, has risen exponentially since the 1970s, jumping from about 1 in 5,000 children back then to more than 1 in 68 today -- a more than 7,400 percent increase! Surely this dramatic surge isn't solely due to improved diagnostic protocols that, because they supposedly didn't exist 40 years ago, somehow allowed tens of thousands of autistic children to slip by undetected. Believing such tripe is like believing in the tooth fairy, as common sense dictates that something other than just modern advancements in disease diagnosis is responsible for ever-escalating disease rates. If you pore closely through the data, you'll find several common denominators that the mainstream media and health authorities try their best to ignore, but that also turn up in conjunction with disease: pesticides like Roundup and vaccines. Roundup damages gut bacteria and greatly amplifies toxicity of other herbicides and toxins Contrary to what Monsanto, its manufacturer, claims, Roundup (glyphosate plus 'inert' ingredients that greatly increase its toxicity), the world's most popular herbicide, is extremely toxic to humans. The complex microbiome in the human gut contains the infamous shikimate pathway that Roundup was designed to inhibit, which means that this necessary process to produce essential amino acids is barred from functioning properly when exposed to the herbicide. Most of the conventional wheat grown in the U.S. today is doused with Roundup just prior to harvest, as are virtually all commercially approved genetically modified (GM) crops, the derivatives of which are commonly added to processed foods. Roundup is everywhere, in other words, and data on its use over the years reveals a direct correlation between increased exposure to the herbicide and increased disease rates. Worse is the fact that Roundup has been shown to synergistically increase the toxicity of other herbicides and toxins, making them that much more destructive than they otherwise would be in isolation. MIT researcher Dr. Stephanie Seneff has covered this extensively, noting that Roundup greatly amplifies the toxicity of aluminum, for instance, which is found in many childhood vaccines. Glyphosate prevents gut from absorbing nutrients, causes toxins to accumulate in blood and brain Glyphosate, which is just one of the many toxic ingredients used in Roundup, also impairs the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which the human body needs to chelate minerals and synthesize amino acids. When cytochrome P450 enzymes aren't functioning as they should, virtually every system of the body suffers. 'Despite its reputation, Roundup was by far the most toxic among the herbicides and insecticides tested,' reads a 2014 study published in the journal BioMed Research International . 'This inconsistency between scientific fact and industrial claim may be attributed to huge economic interests, which have been found to falsify health risk assessments and delay health policy decisions.' The link between glyphosate exposure and autism is extensively documented in the scientific literature, as is the corresponding link between glyphosate, vaccines and autism. More on the synergistic toxicity of Roundup and vaccines can be found in the following report by MIT researcher Stephanie Seneff: People.CSAIL.MIT.edu .

0," The claims of the anti-inflammatory properties of various berries and dark leafy greens have been purported for decades, but the main cause of an ever-increasing list of chronic illnesses continues to be inflammation. While at first glance the shared territory between diseases may not be apparent, the correlation is so strong that the physicians can use a diagnosis of arthritis as a risk factor predicting cardiovascular disease. Minimizing inflammation is a matter of defensive maneuvering. Having a healed cut isn't the same as never having been cut While these dietary novelties have demonstrated ability to mediate the overall immune response, many physicians feel that it doesn't make sense to keep healing a recurrent injury instead of avoiding its infliction. Researchers tested a gluten-free vegan diet and found it to lower a selection of inflammatory compounds in the bloodstream, as well as the expected behavior of reinforcing the immune system. Inflammation is the cause and main symptom of many diseases, but is a healthy response to a bad stimuli Inflammation is a biological response that fills an area with blood in order deliver aid to the area as well as scrap and remove damaged tissue for recycling. The body has a security system in place that creates chemical profiles in the same way that police collect data on dangerous criminal offenders. These cells carry a field guide to recognizing threatening chemicals it has encountered before. This may include molecular irritants, bacteria, viruses, or physical trauma. Trauma is communicated chemically even though a new chemical has not been detected. Since cells communicate with each other chemically, a failure of that system will indicate a problem in the same manner. The cells put in a relay call for reinforcements from the immune system. Inflammation forces cells to work an overtime emergency shift. When the inflammation is chronic, the increased stain can manifest in subtle ways, like increased blood flow. In surface tissue, this increase will often generate a noticeable heat flush. It causes blood cells to dilate, which increases blood pressure and the workload of the heart, making the most common signs of immune response elevated body temperature and heart rate. The immune system's appraisal of the vegan diet The study followed two groups of study participants for a year, measuring their cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and amount of oxidized LDL. LDLs are commonly referred to as 'the bad cholesterol'. They are used to transport excess dietary fat into adipose tissue for storage, and can be used as a guide to the degree to which cutbacks in dietary fats need to be made. One group maintained a gluten-free and vegan diet , while the other followed a balanced but inclusive diet. Levels were tested at regular intervals. The results indicated that the gluten-free and vegan diet successfully resulted in lower levels of these bad cholesterols, where the individuals in the other control group experienced no significant change. Those on the vegan diets also experienced a surge in the production of anti-phosphocholin antibodies, which may be useful in defending against the microbes that lead to heart disease. "
0," Superfood enthusiasts know all about the incredible nutritional powers of maca . This superfood, grown in the high Andes mountains in Peru, is packed with vitamins, minerals, proteins, tannins, complex alkaloids and other phytochemicals. It's one of the favorite powders to add to any smoothie, and it's used by virtually all the raw foodies and superfood advocates, including myself. A few years ago, long before selfnews, I visited Macchu Picchu. I hiked there over a 7-day walk, clambering up and down steep mountain sides with my lungs heaving in the thin air (I was also overweight at the time, so it wasn't easy). I remember spending one entire day climbing UP through a pass at 14,000 feet. It was called 'Dead Woman's Pass,' and hiking through it myself, I quickly came to understand why. The climb was grueling. It was soon followed by another entire day spent climbing DOWN, which turns out to be just as brutal on the legs. Imagine walking down a flight of stairs that goes on and on for eight hours... that's what this was like. After seven days of hiking and climbing, we arrived at a crest overlooking Macchu Picchu, the 'city in the sky' that was built by the Incas. And there, my jaw just about dropped to the ground when I looked at the scene below and saw the 20-ton boulders that had been dragged up the mountain side by the thousands in order to build this ancient city. Here's a link to a photo from that exact moment. I took this from an old, low-res camera that I had brought with me, so don't expect the resolution to be great or anything: http://www.selfnews.com/gallery/articles/... (The smaller images on the top right are other pictures I over-layed in PhotoShop.) As I stood there, marveling at the magnificent scene below, I thought to myself 'I just barely dragged myself up the mountain! How on earth could these Incas -- using virtually no technology -- lift 20-ton rocks up steep mountains and drop them into place as temple walls?' Clearly, these folks weren't surviving on Big Macs and Diet Pepsi. They were eating quinoa, spirulina and maca root powder. They lived on superfoods .

Known for its ability to support healthy energy levels, maca has been used by the Incas as a kind of 'Incan superfood ' for thousands of years. It was a central part of the Incan diet when they built Macchu Picchu, in fact. As we all know today, you can't build a city in the sky when you're living on processed junk foods. And the metaphor is true in your own life: Whatever mountain you are attempting to climb right now, superfood nutrition can help you get there! Whether it's maca, or chlorella , or hemp protein, these superfoods can help give your body (and your mind) the level of nutritional support you need to accomplish great things. Try something new in your life! Maca is one of those life-changing superfoods. If you've never tried it before, pick up a bag right now and blend a teaspoon of maca powder into your morning smoothie. It goes great with chocolate smoothies, avocado smoothies, and even strawberry and banana smoothies! Maca tastes a little like roasted chicory root, which tastes a little bit like coffee. But it's not a caffeine stimulant like coffee. Rather, it's considered an 'adaptogenic' herb that supports healthy energy without blasting your nervous system with chemical stimulants. If you're new to maca, try just 1 teaspoon at a time. Then notice the difference in your awareness or energy levels. It's a subtle but very real effect, and I believe maca is one of the superfoods that gave ancient Incas the nutritional support to achieve great things in their own lives -- things we continue to marvel at today.

0," Eating genetically modified corn (GM corn) and consuming trace levels of Monsanto's Roundup chemical fertilizer caused rats to develop horrifying tumors, widespread organ damage, and premature death. That's the conclusion of a shocking new study that looked at the long-term effects of consuming Monsanto's genetically modified corn. The study has been deemed 'the most thorough research ever published into the health effects of GM food crops and the herbicide Roundup on rats.' News of the horrifying findings is spreading like wildfire across the internet, with even the mainstream media seemingly in shock over the photos of rats with multiple grotesque tumors... tumors so large the rats even had difficulty breathing in some cases. GMOs may be the new thalidomide . 'Monsanto Roundup weedkiller and GM maize implicated in 'shocking' new cancer study' wrote The Grocery , a popular UK publication. ( http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/topics/technology... ) It reported, 'Scientists found that rats exposed to even the smallest amounts, developed mammary tumors and severe liver and kidney damage as early as four months in males, and seven months for females.' The Daily Mail reported, 'Fresh row over GM foods as French study claims rats fed the controversial crops suffered tumors.' ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/artic... ) It goes on to say: 'The animals on the GM diet suffered mammary tumors , as well as severe liver and kidney damage. The researchers said 50 percent of males and 70 percent of females died prematurely , compared with only 30 percent and 20 percent in the control group.' The study, led by Gilles-Eric Seralini of the University of Caen, was the first ever study to examine the long-term (lifetime) effects of eating GMOs . You may find yourself thinking it is absolutely astonishing that no such studies were ever conducted before GM corn was approved for widespread use by the USDA and FDA, but such is the power of corporate lobbying and corporate greed. The study was published in The Food & Chemical Toxicology Journal and was just presented at a news conference in London. Findings from the study Here are some of the shocking findings from the study: Up to 50% of males and 70% of females suffered premature death . Rats that drank trace amounts of Roundup (at levels legally allowed in the water supply) had a 200% to 300% increase in large tumors. Rats fed GM corn and traces of Roundup suffered severe organ damage including liver damage and kidney damage. The study fed these rats NK603 , the Monsanto variety of GM corn that's grown across North America and widely fed to animals and humans. This is the same corn that's in your corn-based breakfast cereal, corn tortillas and corn snack chips. The Daily Mail is reporting on some of the reaction to the findings: France's Jose Bove, vice-chairman of the European Parliament's commission for agriculture and known as a fierce opponent of GM, called for an immediate suspension of all EU cultivation and import authorisations of GM crops. 'This study finally shows we are right and that it is urgent to quickly review all GMO evaluation processes,' he said in a statement. 'National and European food security agencies must carry out new studies financed by public funding to guarantee healthy food for European consumers.' ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/artic... ) Read the study abstract The study is entitled, 'A Comparison of the Effects of Three GM Corn Varieties on Mammalian Health.' Read the abstract here: http://www.biolsci.org/v05p0706.htm That abstract include this text. Note: 'hepatorenal toxicity' means toxic to the liver. Our analysis clearly reveals for the 3 GMOs new side effects linked with GM maize consumption, which were sex- and often dose-dependent. Effects were mostly associated with the kidney and liver, the dietary detoxifying organs, although different between the 3 GMOs. Other effects were also noticed in the heart, adrenal glands, spleen and haematopoietic system. We conclude that these data highlight signs of hepatorenal toxicity, possibly due to the new pesticides specific to each GM corn. In addition, unintended direct or indirect metabolic consequences of the genetic modification cannot be excluded. Here are some quotes from the researchers: 'This research shows an extraordinary number of tumors developing earlier and more aggressively - particularly in female animals. I am shocked by the extreme negative health impacts.' - Dr Michael Antoniou, molecular biologist, King's College London . 'We can expect that the consumption of GM maize and the herbicide Roundup, impacts seriously on human health.' - Dr Antoniou. 'This is the first time that a long-term animal feeding trial has examined the impact of feeding GM corn or the herbicide Roundup, or a combination of both and the results are extremely serious. In the male rats , there was liver and kidney disorders, including tumors and even more worryingly, in the female rats, there were mammary tumors at a level which is extremely concerning; up to 80 percent of the female rats had mammary tumors by the end of the trial.' - Patrick Holden, Director, Sustainable Food Trust.

0," Thousands of residents living in dozens of neighborhoods at the center of the 'Big Apple' are the latest victims to be forcibly sprayed with toxic pesticides as part of the ongoing, nationwide propaganda circus involving West Nile virus (WNv). Reports indicate that thousands of Manhattanites and others living in Brooklyn and elsewhere have already begun to be doused with Anvil, a toxic insecticide chemical linked to endocrine disruption, liver damage, infertility, cognitive damage, and cancer , among other conditions. As of this writing, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reports that there have been a mere 10 documented cases of West Nile Encephalitis or Meningitis in New York thus far in 2012 ( http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/wnv/wnvr1-2012.shtml ), which is apparently enough to warrant mass chemical sprayings throughout Manhattan's prestigious Upper West Side, Brooklyn's South Side, Central Park, and elsewhere. The sprayings reportedly began on Friday, August 31, and have continued in the days that followed. Anvil is safe, but it actually isn't, say officials New York officials have already come out claiming that Anvil poses 'no significant risks to human health,' insisting all the while that mass ground sprayings are the best preventive measure the city can take to curb mosquito populations that might be harboring the much-feared disease. And yet in the same breath, officials also warned that 'some individuals may experience health effects ,' which has created much confusion throughout the city. It turns out that not everyone was convinced from the start that blanketing large swaths of New York City in pesticides was a good idea, and many tried to protest the decision. But just like in Dallas, Texas, where similar aerial sprayings of pesticides recently took place ( http://www.selfnews.com ), officials flatly ignored the concerns of the populace and proceeded forward with their plans to blast a known neurotoxin throughout New York City's residential enclaves. 'We don't need to poison our environment, kill off the mosquitoes' natural predators, and cause long-term health problems,' said Mitchel Cohen, Coordinator of the group No Spray Coalition , to Windsor Terrace-Kensington Patch about the misguided spraying efforts. 'And that's exactly what these spray trucks are going to do.' Activist and A.R.T.I.S.T. president Robert Lederman actually put together a comprehensive list of the Top 10 Lies About West Nile Virus and Anvil that explains how the side-effects associated with exposure to Anvil are often extreme , despite what authorities might claim. He also expounds upon why WNv is hardly the 'deadly' disease that the mainstream media and federal health authorities continually claim it to be. ( http://www.pesticidefreezone.org/top_10_lies.htm ) West Nile virus may not even exist What is even more disturbing about all the WNv hysteria; however, is the fact that the disease itself may not even exist . Freelance investigative reporter Jon Rappoport recently wrote a piece about how there is no concrete scientific evidence proving that WNv is even a real disease , as it has never been isolated and examined. The symptoms associated with the disease that is currently being correlated with mosquito bites here in the U.S. are likely being caused by some other factor. ( http://www.selfnews.com ) One such possibility is that the individuals who are being diagnosed with WNv virus are actually suffering from exposure to environmental chemicals and air pollution. If this is the case, spraying Anvil as a supposed remedy will only make the problem worse, and potentially exacerbate the number of people who become ill or die from compounded chemical exposure. Be sure to read Lederman's complete analysis of the WNv/Anvil scam at: http://www.pesticidefreezone.org/top_10_lies.htm "
0," How do we solve the healthcare crisis? It's simple - strengthen the immune system by avoiding junk foods, developing healthy relationships, remain active and eat fresh, living food - as often as possible. The selfnews Talk Hour presents Raw Basics - Vibrant Foods for Optimal Health with our special guest Jenny Ross, gourmet raw food chef. 'The health of our future is strongly connected to our food choices'. - Jonathan Landsman 'Thank You for your wonderful show!' - Carolyn 3 Major RAW Food Myths Myth Number One: 'It's all (raw food) or nothing - for a health benefit.' The simple truth is that a small change to your diet like, eating fruit for breakfast instead of factory-farmed ham and eggs on a roll - can greatly improve your health. Myth Number Two: 'All raw food must be eaten cold.' Absolutely not! In fact, most raw food experts would agree that food warmed up to 104 degrees is still considered raw. So, enjoy warm bread or soup as often as you like. Myth Number Three: 'A raw food diet is only fruits and vegetables.' Actually, many raw food lovers enjoy a wide variety of foods, including, nuts, seeds, nut 'milks', sea vegetables, sprouted grains and fresh juices. You can even try some fermented beverages like Kombucha or processed foods like miso. Want to really know why raw food is so valuable for human health? Our next guest, Jenny Ross will reveal the healing power of raw foods, how to keep 'in balance', plus much more.

Raw food is packed with essential nutrients, enzymes and minerals for easy absorption into the body. Since it takes less energy to digest your food - you'll have more energy for living. Secondly, raw food supports detoxification. The high fiber content helps to rid the body of excess mucus, toxins and accumulated waste products. There's nothing better than a clean digestive system. And, finally, raw food has greater nutritional value than cooked food. Did you know that any food cooked above 118 degrees will lose its enzymes, nutrients, minerals and vitamins? In fact, using Kirlian photography, you can actually compare the energy that surrounds living food to the energy that surrounds cooked/dead food. Living food has much more energy - as seen in Kirlian photography. I hope you can join us for a great show!

0," There is a concerted effort currently underway to demonize all things meat, regardless of how it is raised or produced, by blaming disease, obesity, and now even global warming, on human meat consumption. And a recent paper put out by S. Matthew Liao, a professor of philosophy and bioethics at New York University , outlines some outlandish solutions for how to combat so-called man-made climate change, including a recommendation that pharmaceutical companies develop drugs to induce nausea when people eat beef or pork products. In a recent interview with Ross Anderson from The Atlantic , Liao presents his case for why he believes humans need to be micromanaged, controlled, and ultimately genetically-engineered (GE) for the betterment of the planet. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions and implementing various environmental measures are simply not enough, in Liao's mind, to stop his theory of man-made climate change, which has led him to envision a world where human beings are genetically redesigned with 'eco-friendly' characteristics, and where pharmaceutical drugs are used to reprogram the way people think and act. Drug-induced vegetarianism to 'save the planet' Making no differentiation between meat that comes from grass-fed, pasture-based livestock, and meat from genetically-modified (GM), grain-fed, confined livestock, Liao claims that 'livestock farming' in general is responsible for a large bulk of man-made global warming. So his solution to this alleged problem is to urge drug companies to create a pill or patch that would induce nausea when a person consumes a meat product. 'The paper suggests that such individuals could take a pill that would trigger mild nausea upon the ingestion of meat, which would then lead to a lasting aversion to meat-eating,' writes Anderson about Liao's idea of an anti-meat drug, which admittedly would be voluntary, at least initially. And if the drug option is not plausible, then Liao suggests an anti-meat patch that would stimulate an immune response that rejects the assimilation of meat proteins in the body. Pasture-raised animals actually help the environment, naturally improve soil health Liao's short-sighted and ignorant views about meat production are concerning, because they could be used to implement tyrannical restrictions on meat consumption in the very near future. What Liao fails to grasp is the difference between the factory-farm model of raising livestock, which is destroying human health and the environment, and small-scale, pasture-based models of raising livestock, which are actually improving the environment and soil health. Back in 2010, Lisa Abend from TIME wrote a great piece about how grass-fed livestock operations are changing the way meat is produced, and all for the better. Unlike conventional livestock, grazing animals eat grass and other forage that humans cannot eat, and naturally work manure and other organic matter into soil while they ruminate, which improves soil nutrient content and keeps carbon dioxide in the ground where it belongs ( http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html ). In the pasture-based model, grazing animals are a vital part of the ecological cycle rather than a detriment to it, and the meat these animals produce is highly-nutritious and rich in healthy omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients. Pasture-raised animals, in other words, are an essential component of vibrant environmental health, as opposed to their confined counterparts, which are responsible for immense environmental destruction ( http://www.selfnews.com/027199_meat_fat_cattle.html ). Discriminatory embryo selection, genetically-modified humans, and other Hitlerian 'perfect race' agendas to combat climate change The culmination of Liao's proposals for combating climate change include much more than just anti-meat drugs and patches, though. Taken directly from the Adolph Hitler playbook for creating a 'perfect race,' Liao's other suggestions include genetically-engineering humans to be smaller in size than normal in order to reduce global consumption patterns, and even altering human eyes to be more 'cat-like' in order to reduce energy use. Cats' eyes, of course, can see very well in the dark, which means humans with cat eyes would use less electricity to power lamps, according to Liao. And smaller humans would use less gasoline when driving their vehicles because, well, they weigh less. And in order to facilitate all these drastic genetic and trait changes, Liao suggests selectively choosing human embryos that meet these desired characteristics, while discarding those that do not, a Malthusian concept foreshadowed in the 1997 movie Gattaca . Likewise, Liao's ideas for developing 'empathy-increasing' drugs that alter the way humans respond to absurd proposals such as the ones he is making in the name of saving the environment are eerily reminiscent of the hallucinogenic 'soma' drug given to future global citizens in the iconic classic Brave New World . The purpose of soma was to induce feelings of comfort and acquiescence to world government mandates that an otherwise rational person would likely recognize almost immediately as dehumanizing and utterly horrific. Perhaps the sickest aspect of Liao's proposals is the fact that he admittedly refers to them as 'liberty-enhancing.' Allowing mad scientists to genetically manipulate the way humans develop, procreate, eat, live, function, and respond to government policies and proposals is anything but liberty-enhancing -- it is the pseudo-intellectual vomit of world government conquer-and-control agendas that are now using so-called 'climate change' as an excuse to begin implementing them.

0," Despite the Obama Administration's best efforts to keep its negotiations regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact secret, enough details have emerged through various sources to paint a very unflattering picture about the deal. For instance, 'trade' is a very small part of the TPP. According to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, just five of 29 sections of the agreement actually deal with trade . 'First of all, it is the largest ever international economic treaty that has ever been negotiated, very considerably larger than NAFTA. It is mostly not about trade, only 5 of the 29 Chapters are about traditional trade,' he said during an interview from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been given asylum as he eludes capture. 'The others are about regulating the internet, and what information internet service providers have to collect, they have to hand it over to companies under certain circumstances, the regulation of labor conditions, regulating the way you can favor local industry, regulating the hospital, health care system, privatization of hospitals, so essentially every aspect of a modern economy, even banking services are in the TPP.' 'Fast-track ' to destruction WikiLeaks has already published one chapter of the agreement and has offered a bounty of $100,000 for a full version of the current agreement. Assange is joined in his characterization of TPP, and his criticism, by former Reagan Administration economist Paul Craig Roberts, who, in a recent post on his personal blog , said 'the Transatlantic and Transpacific Trade and Investment Partnerships have nothing to do with free trade.' In reality, he charges, 'free trade' is merely a disguise to hide the power that these agreements seek to give corporations who will employ lawsuits to overturn sovereign laws of nations that dare to regulate such public interests as pollution, GMO foods and minimum wages. 'The first thing to understand is that these so-called 'partnerships' are not laws written by Congress,' Roberts wrote. 'The US Constitution gives Congress the authority to legislate, but these laws are being written without the participation of Congress. The laws are being written by corporations solely in the interest of their power and profit. The office of US Trade Representative was created in order to permit corporations to write law that serves only their interests. This fraud on the Constitution and the people is covered up by calling trade laws 'treaties.'' A number of mostly Republican lawmakers are supportive of providing President Obama the fast-track trade authority he seeks to close the TPP and other related trade deals. Fast-track authority means the president can close a deal and then submit the entire package to Congress for an up-or-down vote without changes . Some say they have been able to enter the secret room below the Capitol Building to read the agreement, but two members of House Speaker John Boehner's leadership team, who are attempting to shepherd fast-track through their chamber, recently refused to say one way or another if they've read the TPP . Supporters of fast track also say that Congress (and the public) will be given 60 days to review the final version of TPP before a vote, but opponents of the measure including many in Obama's own Democrat Party aren't buying it. Rule by Monsanto, others Neither is Roberts. 'Indeed,' he wrote, 'Congress is not even permitted to know what is in the laws and is limited to the ability to accept or refuse what is handed to Congress for a vote. Normally, Congress accepts, because 'so much work has been done' and 'free trade will benefit us all.'' Where have we heard that before? NAFTA, during Bill Clinton's first few years in office, comes to mind and that agreement has resulted in massive losses of American manufacturing jobs. Roberts says the 'partnerships' forged within TPP essentially provide immunity to the laws of sovereign countries for corporations on grounds that some laws will adversely impact commerce (and profits), thus constituting a 'restraint' on trade. For instance, he notes, under the TPP, France's laws against GMO crops would be overturned in lawsuits filed by Monsanto. You can read his entire column here .

0," It has been noted that, before a new idea or concept can be fully accepted and integrated into society, the oldest generation must first die off. That's why it is perhaps not too surprising that the two oldest members of the United States Senate are among the most rabid foes of marijuana legalization . Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat, both 82 years old, are a throwback to the 'reefer madness' era when cannabis was purported to be a dangerous narcotic used only by sex-crazed, murderous dope fiends (who were likely also members of a racial minority). The two political dinosaurs revealed the depth of their outdated ignorance and intolerance when holding a recent hearing inquiring: 'Is the Department of Justice Adequately Protecting the Public From the Impact of State Recreational Marijuana Legalization?' Attempting to bolster the foregone conclusion that the public actually needs protection from the 'impact' of legalization, the senators trotted out several anti-legalization witnesses, including Nebraska's attorney general, a California U.S. attorney and a Governmental Accountability Office analyst. Grassley vs. grass Grassley is clearly from the old school in terms of his attitude towards marijuana he repeats the timeworn 'gateway drug' mantra claiming that marijuana use leads to opioid abuse . He is opposed to the federal government's sensible policy of respecting the Tenth Amendment and allowing states to determine their own approaches to legalization without interference from Washington. He is concerned that 'the Department of Justice decided to all but abandon the enforcement of federal law relating to the possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana in states that were in the process of becoming the only jurisdictions in the world to legalize and regulate all these activities for recreational use.' In other words, he believes that state-approved marijuana growers and retailers should be arrested and put out of business, despite the growing consensus that marijuana should and probably eventually will be legalized at the federal level. Meanwhile, the old guard remains staunch in its opposition to social progress. They reminisce about the good old 'Just Say No' era and would like to continue fighting the War on Drugs , ignoring the fact that it has been an utter failure from the beginning. When Grassley asserts that 'good people don't smoke marijuana,' he is condemning more than two-fifths of the population yes, that's right, more than 40 percent of all Americans have used marijuana at least once in their lifetimes. Feinstein: 'The worst senator on marijuana reform' Senator Feinstein's stance is right in line with that of (the ironically named) Grassley she has been called 'the worst senator on marijuana reform.' From SFWeekly.com: As California's senior U.S. senator, Feinstein has for more than 20 years reliably voted for tougher controls on drugs and against any end to cannabis prohibition. When the state had the opportunity to be the first in the country to re-legalize cannabis for adults in 2010, Feinstein served as the prohibitionist campaign's chairwoman. This hard-line stance puts Feinstein at odds not only with her constituents but also her colleagues, many of whom represent more conservative places. When a U.S. Senate committee in mid-June considered a spending amendment to de-funded federal Justice Department efforts to interfere in state-legal cannabis, Feinstein was the sole Democrat to vote against it. Whatever happened to government 'by and for the people'? In 2014, a majority of California voters said they don't want Feinstein to serve another term, and it's pretty obvious why she is out of step with her constituency and stubbornly resists the inevitable shift towards sane marijuana policies at the state and federal level. We need fresh blood in Washington perhaps the next election will send the message that Americans are ready for some housecleaning in Congress. Meanwhile, dinosaurs continue to roam the earth...

0," In order to avoid completely losing their businesses and livelihoods to the predatory business model of Monsanto, 60 family farmers, seed businesses and organic agricultural organizations have collectively filed a preemptive lawsuit against the multinational biotechnology giant. Filed by the Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) on behalf of the plaintiffs, the suit seeks judicial protection against the inevitable lawsuits Monsanto will file against non-GM and organic farmers when its genetically-modified (GM) seeds and other materials contaminate their fields. In the past, Monsanto has successfully sued farmers in both the US and Canada for allegedly violating patent protections. But the truth is that Monsanto's seeds or other genetic materials have inadvertently trespassed on nearby crop fields, for which any rational person can see makes Monsanto the violator. But Monsanto has someone been able to twist this before the courts to claim that the owners of the contaminated fields were guilty of patent infringement -- and shockingly, Monsanto has actually won numerous cases on this illegitimate platform ( http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=G... ). With the recent deregulation of GM alfalfa -- and many more GM crops soon on the way -- organic farmers and the organizations that represent and fight for them can see the coming storm. If given free reign over agriculture, Monsanto and its 'Frankenseeds' will eventually take over the whole of agriculture -- and this is a fact. So the plaintiffs are doing the only thing they can, which is to take proactive steps now to protect non-GM and organic agriculture from being completely destroyed by Monsanto . 'Some say transgenic seed can coexist with organic seed, but history tells us that's not possible, and it's actually in Monsanto's financial interest to eliminate organic seed so that they can have a total monopoly over our food supply,' said Dan Ravicher, Executive Director of PUBPAT. 'Monsanto is the same chemical company that previously brought us Agent Orange, DDT, PCB's and other toxins, which they said were safe, but we know are not. Now Monsanto says transgenic seed is safe, but evidence clearly shows it is not.' Over 270,000 members are represented as plaintiffs in the case, and thousands of them are certified organic family farmers . The case, Organic Seed Growers & Trade Association, et al. v. Monsanto, has been assigned to Judge Naomi Buchwald in a Manhattan, NY, federal district court. You can read a full copy of the suit here: http://www.pubpat.org/assets/files/seed/OSGA... 'None of Monsanto's original promises regarding genetically modified seeds have come true after 15 years of wide adoption by commodity farmers. Rather than increased yields or less chemical usage, farmers are facing more crop diseases, an onslaught of herbicide-resistant superweeds, and increased costs from additional herbicide application,' said David Murphy, founder and Executive Director of Food Democracy Now! 'Even more appalling is the fact that Monsanto's patented genes can blow onto another farmer's fields and that farmer not only loses significant revenue in the market but is frequently exposed to legal action against them by Monsanto's team of belligerent lawyers. Crop biotechnology has been a miserable failure economically and biologically and now threatens to undermine the basic freedoms that farmers and consumers have enjoyed in our constitutional democracy.'

0," If you are pregnant, between the ages of 28 and 38, and a citizen of the U.K., the government-run National Health Service (NHS) wants to see you vaccinated for whooping cough as part of a new mass vaccination propaganda campaign that appears to be sweeping the industrialized world. Mimicking the same tactics used by the U.S. healthcare machine, NHS is now trying to scare pregnant women into getting the whooping cough vaccine by telling them that their babies could die without it, even though the efficacy of the vaccine has never been proven. Also known as pertussis, whooping cough is reportedly on the rise throughout the U.K., with more than 4,700 confirmed cases of the disease, or more than four times the number confirmed in 2011, identified so far this year. Even though only nine babies in the U.K. are said to have died in 2012 as a result of whooping cough -- and these more than likely were the result of other complications related to weak immunity -- NHS is urging all pregnant women to get the vaccine in order to 'pass on' immunity to their unborn babies. Since most of the babies contracting whooping cough are too young to be vaccinated themselves, health officials have decided that vaccinating pregnant women will be just as effective at preventing the disease among young children, who are said to have the highest risk. But what these same authorities have not explained is precisely how the vaccine will accomplish this task, nor have they presented any evidence proving that the vaccine even prevents whooping cough infection in the first place. Science suggests whooping cough vaccine responsible for spreading disease As we pointed out in an earlier piece, the vast majority of whooping cough cases in these supposed outbreaks are among children that have already been vaccinated for whooping cough . Even after accounting for statistical variances between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, the fact remains that vaccinated children are far more susceptible to developing whooping cough than are unvaccinated children. ( http://www.selfnews.com ) To add to this, recent research has shown that the whooping cough vaccines are actually responsible for causing pertussis strains to mutate and become more virulent. With this in mind, it is logical to reasonably hypothesize that the whooping cough vaccine itself may actually be a primary culprit in the escalating number of disease cases being reported in the U.K., the U.S., and elsewhere. ( http://www.cidd.psu.edu ) Furthermore, the Australian government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), which specializes in researching the effectiveness of medicines, has determined that vaccinating parents against whooping cough provides absolutely no protection for unborn children against whooping cough. ( http://www.news.com.au ) 'The PBAC, which is totally independent and very expert, has determined that there is no clinical effectiveness of this strategy,' professor Chris Brook, Divisional Executive Director of the Australian Department of Health, is quoted as saying earlier this year to news.com.au . 'There has been a national committee meeting to look at this and to make decisions on the basis of the best scientific evidence available ... the evidence is that the strategy has not been effective.' But none of this has stopped health authorities in the U.K. from creating needless panic and fear about babies dropping dead in order to sway pregnant women to get their useless whooping cough jab.

0," California 'raw milk man' James Stewart, who has been persecuted by California officials for his 'crime' of distributing unpasteurized milk, is currently held in Ventura county jails. Yesterday, he met with his new legal team, led by Matt Bromund of the Bromund Law Group in Ventura ( www.BromundLaw.com ). Bromund, who has also represented Sharon Palmer of Healthy Family Farms, is very familiar with the tactics now being attempted by the Ventura County D.A. to try to paint farmers as criminals. As selfnews previously reported, both Ventura County and L.A. County are waging a vicious persecution campaign against Stewart ( http://www.selfnews.com/035197_James_Stew... ), and we have learned this is because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered state authorities to prosecute James in order to 'set an example' so that no one else across the country even considers selling raw milk. The FDA even provided around $80,000 in grant money, plus a network of spies and infiltration operatives ( http://www.selfnews.com/033428_FDA_secret... ) to aid in the persecution campaign. California attorney Ajna Sharma-Wilson is also on Stewart's legal team, working as an adjunct attorney to help in the case. She describes James Stewart as '...being treated like a political prisoner.' She told selfnews yesterday: 'Every move he's making is being scrutinized. I've visited jails hundreds of times, I've never been treated like that. There's something going on. They want to take down james and they're doing everything possible from every angle. The entire Ventura county case is about Character assassination to make James look like a criminal.' Motion to dismiss to be reviewed as early as Monday Matt Bromund told selfnews he intends to file a motion to dismiss all charges against Stewart, and that such a motion could be reviewed by a judge as early as Monday (but could also take much longer, depending on the circumstances). Bromund is very optimistic about the outcome. 'I think the motion to dismiss the case should be very easy for the judge to grant. [Stewart] should get prompt resolution at law on this case, and in the mean time he's going to get all kinds of extraordinary scrutiny because there is an agenda that has been set by various agencies of California.' That agenda, as selfnews readers well know, is to destroy raw milk and persecute anyone who touches it. This is the new model of police state crony capitalism in America: Big industry runs the regulators, and the regulators are criminal gangs that misuse their power to destroy any competition of their corporate masters. The agenda to 'get James Stewart ,' after all, is really a protection racket to make sure the pasteurized milk industry -- offering dead, pasteurized, artificially homogenized milk with high levels of pus and blood -- has no competition from fresh, local food producers which run far cleaner operations ( http://www.selfnews.com/035039_raw_milk_p... ). Public vigil already being coordinated A public vigil for James Stewart -- who is without question a political prisoner in a criminally-run police state 'justice' system -- is already being planned. selfnews will announce the details shortly.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) According to new research published in the October issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, patients with high cholesterol who are taking high-dose statin drugs may be able to reduce the effects on their hearts by supplementing their diets with foods rich in plant sterols. High cholesterol -- hypercholesterolaemia -- has strong links to cardiovascular disease, which causes nearly 50 percent of deaths in Europe, and costs the EU roughly $202 billion each year. Previous studies have suggested that patients with high cholesterol can reduce their cholesterol levels by 8 to 17 percent by consuming 1.5 to 3 grams of plant sterols or stanols every day, which translates to a reduction in the risk of heart disease. Researchers from the University Medical Centre Utrecht and the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands studied 20 hypercholesterolaemic patients who were receiving a daily maximum dose of statin drugs -- atorvastatin or simvastatin, 80 mg. The randomized, single-blind study split the participants into two groups: the first received 3 grams of plant stanol-enriched margarine per day (Johnson & Johnson brand Benecol) for six weeks, and the second group received stanol-free margarine each day for six weeks. Both margarines contained the same amount of fat -- 62 percent. At the end of the six-week trial, the group given stanol-enriched margarine experienced a 9.9 percent reduction in plasma cholesterol and a 15.6 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol, while levels of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) -- which is responsible for transporting cholesterol to tissues -- fell by 10.8 percent. Conversely, the control group only experienced a 7.7 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol remained the same, and ApoB levels fell by 6.8 percent. 'Intensive dietary intervention with addition of plant stanols results in clinically relevant reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients optimally treated with statins, compared with similar patients on statins receiving only standard care,' the researchers wrote. However, consumer health advocate Mike Adams, author of 'Grocery Warning,' says this research should indicate to patients that plant stanols and sterols can actually replace statin drugs. 'Statin drugs are dangerous chemicals that can produce extremely harmful -- even fatal -- side effects,' Adams said. 'Replacing them with plant-based medicines under the care of a naturopathic physician can greatly improve the health of patients while greatly reducing the cost of their treatment.' ### "
0," Steve Jobs shrouded his treatment choices in secrecy while struggling with the pancreatic cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004. His secrecy was tight enough to annoy Apple executives. A top Apple director, Jerry York, was quoted off the record saying that he was so displeased with Jobs's lack of transparency regarding his illness that he had nearly resigned from the board over the matter. York's off the record status was removed after his death in 2010. But this 'lack of transparency' was frustrating to Apple directors and executives running a multi-billion dollar enterprise while Steve would go on leaves of absence to attempt different treatments secretly and then return only to go off secretly again. And that was just the kind of activity from a prominent pubic figure that promoted rumors and medical mafia-fueled media misinformation that once again was used to malign alternative cancer treatments. What is known about Steve Jobs' cancer and treatments The type of pancreatic cancer diagnosed for Job was a rare but less virulent form known as neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, which manifest from the cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. It's considered treatable with early surgery, which Job underwent shortly after the diagnosis. What was publicized, however, was Steve's reluctance to surgery and his preference for a curative diet instead. Never mind the fact that he indeed had tumors surgically removed from his pancreas in 2004, shortly after his diagnosis. The media focus was on his preference for an undisclosed dietary approach and that he was a vegetarian. All that means is that he didn't eat meat. How much processed foods and sugars he consumed is unknown. But right away, the shadow was cast on healthy dietary approaches. This misinformation was used to pontificate about how Steve blew it by not undergoing conventional treatments immediately, even though he did! Another treatment Jobs underwent was disclosed after his demise. It was an unusual approach by a Swiss medical center that's not available in the USA. It's a special form of hormone-delivered radiotherapy (radiation) developed by the University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland. Though unique, it's a variation of orthodox oncology that mainstream media incorrectly label 'alternative.' Jobs had secretly visited the Swiss hospital around 2009. But shortly after that, in the same year, he underwent an unpublicized controversial liver transplant in a Memphis, Tennessee, hospital. Evidently, the cancer had spread to his liver. Steve Jobs was advised to enroll in more than one liver transplant waiting list. Tennessee has a short list. Multiple enrollments are considered legal, but only the extremely well-off can manage it. This gives billionaires unfair advantages. Even shadier, Steve owned a large, expensive house in Memphis, controlled by one of his LLCs (limited liability companies). And during Jobs' last two years, the surgeon who performed the transplant lived there while he was going through divorce proceedings, with the LLC attorneys paying all the large utility bills and high real estate taxes that whole time. The surgeon, Dr. James Eason, has not commented on whether he actually paid rent during those two years, but he did manage to purchase the home from the LLC at below market value after Steve passed away. Dr. Eason maintains that Steve Jobs was the most needy candidate for a liver transplant on their list. But some medical experts and journalists suggest conflicts of interest involving the treasured, large house. Many surgeons consider liver transplants for cancer patients as wasting donor organs. Also, the immune system issues with a strange new organ and use of immunosuppressive drugs to allow transplants create a bigger burden for a cancer patient's immune system. Steve passed away two years later, months after his last orthodox oncology attempt with chemotherapy at the Stanford Cancer Center in Palo Alto, California. Little of Steve's chemotherapy was mentioned by mainstream media, but Mike Adams was all over it here ( http://www.selfnews.com ). "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Plant phytonutrients found in Brussels sprouts boost the body`s natural defense systems to protect against cancer and other diseases. Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables disarm cancer causing chemicals and encourage the body`s detoxification enzymes. Evidence in the Netherlands suggests that Brussels sprouts keep the body free from cancer by promoting healthy DNA. DNA is responsible for cell division in the body. When DNA gets damaged, cells may begin to replicate much more rapidly than normal, which can cause a cancerous tumor to begin to form. Several studies reveal that Brussels sprouts have the ability to help protect DNA from damage. Researchers compared two groups of healthy men. Half of these men ate 300 grams of Brussels sprouts daily, while the other men didn`t have any cruciferous vegetables in their diet. After three weeks, the men who ate their daily dose of Brussels sprouts had a 28% decrease in measured DNA damage. Diminish Digestive Cancers with Brussels Sprouts The phytonutrients in Brussels sprouts have been shown to protect against heterocyclic amines, which are the carcinogenic compounds found in grilled and charbroiled meat. These carcinogens are particularly associated with colon cancer. The study, published in Carcinogenesis , found that animals that were given Brussels sprout juice and heterocyclic amine carcinogen were less likely to develop the cancer. The animals given Brussels sprouts had a reduction in pre-cancerous cells in the colon of 41-52% in the colon and 27-67% in the liver, and drastically diminished the size (85-91%) of pre-cancerous lesions in the liver. These amazing results seem to be a result of Brussels sprouts potent ability to detoxify the body and clear out the colon. Brussels sprouts are also packed with fiber, which nourishes the cells lining the walls of the colon and prevents colon problems including cancer . Brussels Sprouts Fight Bladder Cancer Research published in the International Journal of Cancer shows that Brussels sprouts protect against bladder cancer. The diets of 697 people who were recently diagnosed with bladder cancer were compared with 708 people with the same age, gender and ethnicity who were healthy. The average daily intake of Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables was significantly lower in those with bladder cancer than in their healthy counterparts. Those who had the highest intake of Brussels sprouts and cruciferous vegetables had a 29% lower risk of bladder cancer that those who ate the least. The benefits of these vegetables were highest in those who have the highest risk of bladder cancer, including men, smokers and older individuals. Brussels sprout`s bladder cancer properties appear to come from their high levels isothiocyanates, which are potent anti-carcinogens. Isothiocyanates travel through the bladder to be excreted, making them particularly powerful against this form of cancer. Breast Cancer Protection Sulforaphane is released by Brussels sprouts and has been proven to trigger the liver to produce enzymes that detoxify the body of cancer-causing chemicals They have been shown to inhibit chemically-induced breast cancers in animal studies. Research published in the Journal of Nutrition shows that sulforaphane can halt the proliferation of breast cancer cells, even in the later stages of their growth. Defend Against Prostate Cancer Research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle studied 1,000 men. It was shown that eating 28 servings of different vegetables a week reduced their risk of prostate cancer by 35%. But those who ate 3 or more servings of cruciferous vegetables each week had a 44% lower prostate cancer risk. Many people claim to not enjoy eating Brussels sprouts. If you are not a fan of this incredible food, try chopping them up into tiny peices and sprinkling them over a salad.

0," The irony is inescapable: In reaction to the historic drought that has transformed the California dream into California dust, the state is now embarking on the construction of a wave of desalination plants that will turn ocean water into fresh water. Tragically, these power-hungry desalination plants will be running primarily on fossil fuel-generated electricity , meaning that California residents will have to commit global warming crimes (i.e. producing carbon dioxide) every time they flush their toilets or take a shower. Fresh water, in other words, is about to have a 'fossil fuel consumption equivalent' across the state. Every gallon of water consumed will have a calculable CO2 emission profile and mercury pollution factor, meaning that a person will not be able to live in California without being a global warming sinner. California, of course, is the state that prides itself on being progressive and environmentally conscious. Yes its non-sustainable lifestyle consumed the region's limited fossil water supplies to the point of near-collapse. Now, it must become America's worst carbon dioxide producer just to provide basic water supplies to its people. And where will all the natural gas and coal come from that powers these desalination plants? The very same energy-producing states that Californians typically condemn for producing fossil fuels . Flush a toilet and you destroy the planet Most eco-conscious Californians are unaware that the energy they use comes predominantly from fossil fuels. ( See source. ) Natural gas -- which produces carbon dioxide when burned -- generates almost half the state's electricity. Coal generates another eight percent or so, meaning that fossil fuels provide the majority of California's electricity . (Renewables only provide about 18 percent, and nuclear provides another nine percent or so.) What this means is that as more and more desalination plants come online, they'll be using primarily fossil fuels to process water -- an energy-intensive operation. 'A $1 billion desalination plant to supply booming San Diego County is under construction here and due to open as early as November, providing a major test of whether California cities will be able to resort to the ocean to solve their water woes,' reports the New York Times . 'Plans are far along for a large plant in Huntington Beach that would supply water to populous Orange County. A mothballed plant in Santa Barbara may soon be reactivated. And more than a dozen communities along the California coast are studying the issue.' As each of these plants comes online, they will add an extremely high energy cost to the water consumed by California residents. Every act that consumes water -- washing your hands, watering a garden, flushing a toilet -- will carry a heightened ecological cost . When water simply falls out of the sky, consuming that water is ecologically sound. But when water has to be procured using extremely energy-intensive desalination systems, it can no longer be considered a 'green' resource. '[Desalination plants] will use a huge amount of electricity, increasing the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming, which further strains water supplies,' writes the New York Times, reiterating what the liberal media calls 'concluded science' which claims modern-day global warming is almost entirely caused by human activity. If that's the case, however, then Californians who consume water produced by desalination plants must categorize themselves as global warming sinners who are destroying the planet every time they drink a cup of water. As Food and Water Watch writes: Enormous amounts of energy are needed to force ocean water through tiny membrane filters at a high pressure. Ocean water desalination can be greater than ten times more energy intensive than other supply sources. Ocean desalination proponents, such as private corporations Poseidon Resources and American Water, plan to locate plants alongside existing coastal power plants, thus potentially spurring their emission of global warming pollution. To be consistent with their beliefs, then, California's environmentalists must now either reject all water consumption or leave the region. The mere act of living in California and consuming any water at all -- such as flushing a toilet -- will soon be a direct violation of fundamental ecological principles. Simultaneously, California itself will become a symbol of ecological destruction as it burns fossil fuels to generate water for cities that probably never should have been built in the desert in the first place. Ironically, California's heavy dependence on fossil fuels to produce water will worsen the drought, according to those who follow the global warming narrative. Even according to the New York Times as stated above, fossil fuel-powered desalination will cause California to accelerate its own demise as it contributes to a worsening of global warming. This, ecologically speaking, is a 'spiral of death' that can only lead to California ultimately becoming all but uninhabitable by humans. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Desalination also destroys ocean life Desalinating ocean water, by the way, has destructive ecological consequences far beyond the fossil fuels needed to power it. 'Both the intake of seawater and the disposal of excess salt into the ocean can harm sea life,' explains the New York Times. 'Sucking in huge amounts of seawater, for instance, can kill fish eggs and larvae by the billions.' It also dumps concentrated salt (brine) back into the ocean, where it contaminates the water due to unusually high salt concentration, functioning as a kind of localized poison that kills off nearby marine species. 'The brine, or super salty wastewater created from the desalination process, also has the potential to upset our delicate coastal ecosystems,' writes Food and Water Watch . This means the daily consumption of water in California is not just equated with carbon dioxide emissions... it also directly contributes to the death of life in the Pacific Ocean. In the near future dominated by desalination, then, merely living in California makes you a bad person because you are killing ocean life and destroying the environment with every drop of water you consume or waste. 'Desalination of the sea is not the answer to our water problems. It is survival technology, a life support system, an admission of the extent of our failure.' -- John Archer ( Food and Water Watch Desalination Report - PDF) Californians about to put evil corporations in charge of their water lifeline There's another surprising angle on all this: Shifting to water desalination puts 'evil corporations' in charge of your water lifeline. As Food and Water Watch writes: Ocean desalination provides a new opportunity for private corporations to own and sell water. Currently, there is little regulation of these facilities, creating the possibility that private corporations would rate-gouge thirsty populations -- similar to what happened in the Enron energy scheme. Corporate control of water supplies is a top concern among environmentalists and those focused on 'environmental justice.' When corporations like Nestle seize control of water systems in third world countries, the company is (rightly) condemned by activists who point out that water should never be controlled by for-profit corporations that can price gouge the local population. Yet that's exactly what California is now pursuing! As we all learned from the Enron fiasco, when there's money to be made, corporations consistently place profits as a higher priority than human compassion or human rights. To hand over a significant portion of the state's water supply to for-profit corporations is to invite an inevitable humanitarian catastrophe as those corporations realize people can be forced to pay almost anything for water. Population reduction is the 'ultimate solution' to the water problem, say death-promoting extremist scientists To save the state from a hydrological collapse, water must now be portrayed as evil. People who consume water must be tattled on, reported to authorities or publicly humiliated. Social pressures will now turn California into a state where un-showered people living in overpriced homes manicured with dead lawns and abandoned swimming pools will triple stack their toilet bowls before flushing in order to live within their own self-imposed boundaries of ecological guilt. They will drink their own recycled urine, condemn corporate-owned water bottling plants and vandalize golf courses as a form of ecological protest. And yet, despite their best efforts, every breath they exhale will be their own personal reminder of how they are destroying the planet. It's not just the CO2 they're exhaling, of course: it's also the water that's lost with each breath. Replacing that water now requires contributing to global warming by burning fossil fuels, meaning the very act of human respiration is a crime against the planet if you live in California. The solution to all this, according to an alarming number of technology billionaires, death-loving scientists and radical activists, is to forcibly reduce human population . If the mere act of breathing makes you a threat to the planet, then the world can be saved by literally stopping a few billion people breathing, they believe. Remember Bill Gates' famous population reduction equation? As I wrote in this selfnews article in 2010 : In a recent TED conference presentation, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to new vaccine efforts, speaks on the issue of CO2 emissions and its effects on climate change. He presents a formula for tracking CO2 emissions as follows: CO2 = P x S x E x C. P = People S = Services per person E = Energy per service C = CO2 per energy unit Then he adds that in order to get CO2 to zero, 'probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty close to zero.' Following that, Bill Gates begins to describe how the first number -- P (for People) -- might be reduced. He says: 'The world today has 6.8 billion people... that's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.' It's no surprise, then, that vaccines given to young women in Kenya were recently found to be spiked with sterilization chemicals for population control . 'We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,' Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews . 'They were all laced with HCG.' It's also no surprise that many academics in the United States, such as Dr. Eric Pianka, openly talk about solving the population problem with weaponized viral pandemics. 'Dr. Eric R. Pianka, a Texas ecologist and herpetologist ... suggested during a meeting at the Texas Academy of Sciences that, were Ebola to become airborne, it would likely kill 90 percent of the human population and instantly solve what he called the 'overpopulation problem.'' ( selfnews ) Similarly, Dr. Charles Arntzen, head of The Biodesign Institute for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, publicly joked about using a genetically engineered virus to kill off 25 percent of the population: ( SOURCE ) Has anybody seen 'Contagion?' (laughter) That's the answer! Go out and use genetic engineering to create a better virus. (laughter) Twenty-five percent of the population is supposed to go in 'Contagion.'

0," Americans know that we live in a surveillance society, driven home by the fact that the National Security Agency has been essentially capturing every bit of metadata it can from all of us all of the time. But we knew before that we were being 'watched,' given all of the traffic cams, street cams and satellite surveillance we deal with on a regular basis. What's interesting about this story, however, isn't that retailers are watching us when we shop; it is the manner in which some stores keep an eye on us that is, well, different , as reported by CBS New York : Big Brother could be at your favorite store. As CBS 2's Don Champion reported, a growing number of stores are using discrete and sophisticated technology - including mannequins with facial-recognition cameras hidden in their eyes - to track shopper demographics in an effort to boost sales. Retailers say the marketing data technology allows them to cater their business to customers better, but it's also raising privacy concerns. Ah, yes. Those quaint little 'privacy concerns.' The Fourth Amendment never looked so good, or mattered so little. 'Hey, other systems are more intrusive' This 'unique' surveillance system, called Shopperception, was built by Alfonso Perez and has been utilized by Walmart. According to specs on the system, it links motion-sensors to cameras that then track a shopper's product choice on a particular shelf, as well as the time that it takes for the shopper to make a decision. Perez told CBS New York that his business has doubled in the past year - which means, of course, that your friendly neighborhood big-box retailer cares more about selling you stuff than protecting your constitutional rights. 'We have evolved in the way in which we want our products tailored to our liking,' Perez said. 'The brands and retailers are using this information to learn about us, to learn about what we like,' he added. So, seriously - privacy just doesn't matter anymore? Stores can rip off personal intimate shopping habits at will, even if we don't want anyone else to know what they are? As you might expect, most of the developers of this kind of invasive technology don't think they're doing anything wrong. They don't say their systems are not intrusive - only that they are less intrusive than 'everyday surveillance' such as street and traffic cams. And besides, says Perez, 'We don't store any information on anybody. We process the information real-time.' Tell it to the NSA, Perez. And if you don't store info, how can you match shopping habits to shoppers - in 'real time?' Nevertheless, Perez and others argue that such high-tech systems are vital, because it is becoming more difficult for brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with the online sellers (who also track shopping habits). 'Where do we draw the line?' Joel Reidentberg, a professor of technology at the University of Princeton, said retailers have - understandably - tried to keep mum on the use of the technology. 'If the retailer is unwilling to be transparent with what they're doing, the way they're collecting information, how they're using that information, it says they know their customers will be upset by it,' Reidenberg said, adding: 'We have to decide, do we draw the line?' CBS New York reported that the technology is definitely causing some shoppers to change where they buy. 'Still think it's an invasion of our humanity and who we are as people,' said Bella Milizia. 'It's a little creepy,' another woman told Champion. But as usual, some Americans - constitutional illiterates - don't see anything wrong here. And for the same old reason - lack of guilt. 'You know what, if you're an honest person and you're not up to anything in the store, I think it's fine,' said Janet Sternson.

0," Bin Laden is dead, we've been told. What a relief! According to the official White House explanation of events, it was Bin Laden who masterminded the 9/11 airplane hijackings and commanded his minions to fly them into the World Trade Center buildings. Therefore, we were told, we needed to bring in a whole new layer of airport security across America to keep us all safe from the evil mind of Bin Laden. This, of course, gave rise to the TSA. Now over 60,000 agents strong, the TSA is the agency that feels our junk while ordering us to throw away our bottled water. They're the ones that march us through those naked body scanners or order us to spread our legs while they feel our private parts with the backs of their hands. We're all repeatedly being backhanded by our own government agents, in other words. TSA agents, of course, had Bin Laden to thank for their job security . As long as we were told that Bin Laden was hiding out in a cave somewhere -- connected to a dialysis machine, no less -- we were promised air travel was dangerous and we all needed to submit to TSA treatments that would normally be considered a kind of sexual molestation if not carried out by a federal agent. (Molesting a six-year-old child is a crime if your neighbor does it, but when a TSA agent does it right on camera, Napolitano calls it 'professional.') So now a celebration is in order, right? Bin Laden is dead! Hoorah! The threat to our air safety is over! The entire TSA can pack up and go back to working at Wal-Mart, where the government found them in the first place. Don't hold your breath on freedom Uh, not so fast. You see, even though we were told that Osama Bin Laden was the 'evil mastermind' behind the terror that threatened America, and even though the so-called 'war on terror' was focused in large part on hunting down this one individual, President Obama now tells us that killing Bin Laden has made America more dangerous than ever before. Huh? Wasn't killing Bin Laden supposed to make us safer? Sort of like killing Hitler and taking out the Nazi war machine? But no, killing Bin Laden has apparently decreased our security, we're now told. So alert levels are being raised all across the country, and TSA agents are reaching even deeper down your pants than ever before as if terrorism were somehow found in the darkest crevices of your crotch. Yeah, there might be some scary stuff down there, but it's more like STDs, not WMDs. Getting back to Bin Laden, taking out this guy has apparently inflamed terrorism! That's what we're being told anyway. Be on high alert! The ghost of Bin Laden now haunts the airports across the USA and he might pull a fast one even from beyond the grave! Or his 'followers' might rise up in a global backlash, because they're really angry. And they won't use the backs of their hands, either. So now, instead of celebrating the safety and security we were promised at the conclusion of this manhunt against Bin Laden, we're being informed that the success of that mission leads us directly into -- guess what? More terror! Hence the whole genius of declaring was on a concept like 'terror.' You see, as long as you don't declare war on a person or a country, the war is perpetual . Even if you kill the top military generals and national leaders, you can always claim 'terror' is still at war with America! Thus, there is no condition under which the ' war on terror ' ever ends. Perpetual war. Perpetual fear. Perpetual security alerts. It's the new standard of fear in America: Be afraid at every moment, because the terrorists are still out there, and they apparently hate freedom . America loves freedom, on the other hand, and you can tell by how much we keep taking it away from the people. Why we have perpetual war But the real advantage of perpetual war is that you can use it to enforce perpetual police state tactics against your own people. After all, there's a war on! And who is the war on? TERROR! So unzip your fly, Mr. Traveler. Your way-too-friendly TSA agents have a job to do, even if the entire justification for that job is now six feet under with two bullet holes in his head. I dare you to walk up to a TSA agent and refuse to go through security while citing the death of Bin Laden as the reason. Try to walk their feeble minds through that bit of logic, if you can. Do any of them even remember that Bin Laden was the entire reason they got a job in the first place? TSA agents should be worshipping Bin Laden, for without him, most of those agents would be unemployable. Their main job requirement is to follow orders and stop thinking. And honestly no private industry employer would ever bring on an employee like that. Only the government hires these types of people. Maybe one day they can get a raise and move up from molesting air passengers to raiding raw milk farmers and pulling handguns on blocks of raw cheese! But I say now is the perfect time to get all these 60,000+ TSA agents off the public payroll! This would be the perfect way to celebrate Bin Laden's death. First, we pink slip 60,000 TSA agents and send 'em packing. Then we revoke the Patriot Act, close Guantanamo and get to work restoring the freedoms that George W. Bush said the terrorists took away from us. The rascals! We showed 'em, huh? Why America needs a boogeyman Don't hold your breath on all this, of course. America needs Bin Laden, you see. Or someone like him. Because every great war needs a great boogeyman. And Osama Bin Laden, even though he has been reported dead at least nine times over the last decade, has served a much-needed role to keep people focused on a war effort that has brought America no peace, no security and no freedom. It is a war without end; without a mission; and without any achievable milestones of victory. It is a war designed only to keep the war going. And that part isn't Obama's fault, of course: We can thank the Bush-era cronies for dragging us into this quagmire. Obama is merely continuing the status quo (which, of course, is exactly what he promised to end if he got elected, but none of the people who voted for him seem to remember that anymore). Bin Laden -- winning! The terrorists really have won, you see. America is far less free today than it was in 2001. Osama Bin Laden, after all, never had to go through airport security and have some overpaid goon feel up his coconuts before he could board an airplane. While Bin Laden is resting six feet under, the rest of us are still surrendering our breasts, gonads and hoohas to 'domestic security forces' that treat us as if WE were terrorists! Bin Laden never reached down my pants, you see. He may have been a criminal-minded terrorist, but I very much doubt he molested his own people as part of his security scheme. Only in America do we have sexual molestation in place as a government-sanctioned security system. So why can't we do behavior profiling like the Israelis do? Because our TSA agents aren't capable of engaging in intelligent security conversations with people, it turns out. They can't even spot a handgun if you place it in a bag, shove the bag into the X-Ray machine and actually TRY to get caught (seriously, they failed this test). ( http://www.prisonplanet.com/tsa-scanners-rep... ) So what's the role of the TSA then, in a post-Bin Laden world, where the international terrorism mastermind is now dead and buried? The mission of the TSA, you see, is to let you know -- quite literally -- that the government has you by the balls . And they're going to remind you of that every time you fly, regardless of whether Osama Bin Laden is dead or alive. The killing of an international terrorist makes no different anymore. You are living in a perpetual war state that will keep ratcheting up the fear no matter how many enemies they claim to have assassinated. "
0," Tweet After careful review, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has declared that Merck's psoriasis drug Raptiva (which actually sounds like a sports car or a dinosaur, not a drug) is too dangerous to use on humans. Sales of the drug will now be suspended in Europe following revelations that three patients suffered bizarre brain infections called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Two of the three patients died. In the United States, the FDA continues to allow its sale, possibly because a large number of mass-medicated American medical patients have no remaining brains to infect.

Feel free to quote these in your own work provided you give proper credit to both the original author quoted here and this selfnews page. Clinical research has validated the traditional use of sarsaparilla for skin conditions such as psoriasis , eczema, acne, and leprosy. In 1942, it was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine to improve the condition of psoriasis dramatically. The results of a clinical study with ninety-two patients was detailed, which reported that it improved psoriasis lesions in 62 percent of cases and completely cleared lesions in 18 percent of cases. One of the possible mechanisms of action in psoriasis is sarsaparilla's blood cleansing properties. - The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs: A Guide to Understanding and Using Herbal Medicinals by Leslie Taylor, ND - Available on Amazon.com Essential fatty acid supplements may be beneficial in psoriasis sufferers. Analysis of blood and fat tissue has shown that the amount of anti-inflammatory alpha linolenic acid decreases, while the level of arachidonic acid, which has inflammatory effects, increases. These changes may be more pronounced in patients with severe psoriasis than in those with a milder form of the disease. The results of a 1993 study suggest that eating oily fish may help reduce the symptoms of psoriasis . Some small studies suggest that fish oil supplementation may be beneficial in psoriasis . - The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements and Herbs by Nicola Reavley - Available on Amazon.com Correction of abnormal liver function is indicated in the treatment of psoriasis . Silymarin has been reported to be of value in the treatment of psoriasis , and this may be due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of leukotrienes, and improve liver function. The connection between the liver and psoriasis relates to one of the liver's basic tasks -- filtering the blood. Psoriasis has been shown to be linked to high levels of circulating endotoxins, such as those found in the cell walls of gut bacteria. - The Healing Power of Herbs: The Enlightened Person's Guide to the Wonders of Medicinal Plants by Michael T. Murray, N.D. - Available on Amazon.com Ingestion of alcohol appears to be a risk factor for psoriasis in men but not women. It would therefore be prudent for men with psoriasis to drink moderately, if at all. Anecdotal evidence suggests that people with psoriasis may improve on a hypoallergenic diet.

0," Various cultures around the world already understand that herbs such as ginger, cinnamon, garlic and turmeric can effectively treat conditions like diabetes. According to research from the biomedical science department at the King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia, garlic may be the most powerful of them all for treating diabetes. Meanwhile, the American Diabetes Association believes there is no evidence that herbs like cinnamon or garlic effectively treat diabetes The highly acknowledged American Diabetes Association states that they are 'leading the fight to stop diabetes and its deadly consequences.' This mission statement sounds nice, but it is really just a pretty front. It's all talk with no real solution. It's a vague statement of false hope. The American Diabetes Association is really just keeping people in the dark about diabetes. Here's why: Prior to their lofty mission statement, they establish that 'There is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplements for people with diabetes who do not have underlying vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Nor is there evidence to support the use of cinnamon or other herbs or supplements for the treatment of diabetes.' They couldn't be further from the truth. As they claim to 'fund research to prevent, cure and manage diabetes,' people are left wondering what works and where the money's going. Meanwhile, there is plentiful evidence available showing that herbal, holistic treatments reverse diabetic conditions. In fact, a holistic lifestyle change is the testimony of many natural health advocates. Still, people with diabetes are left in the dark, not knowing where to start. Now is the time for well-known organizations like the American Diabetes Association to confess that clear evidence does exist and that herbs like cinnamon and garlic can effectively treat diabetes. The studies are there. The mechanisms of these powerful natural substances are alive and real. It's clear that herbs are continually downplayed by known organizations as if these organizations are puppets of a higher order, silenced by some kind of drug profiting industry. It's like there's a witch hunt against natural, healing remedies. Medical professionals aren't even educated about the medicinal benefits of something as simple as garlic. (Think of the healthcare savings that would ensue if people grew and used garlic instead of running to the doctor for an antibiotic.) Real, affordable healthcare begins with empowered individuals. Garlic effectively treats diabetes and oxidative stress From the Biomedical Science Department at the King Faisal University in Al-Hofuf, Saudi Arabia, comes a comprehensive study on three herbal spices: garlic, ginger and turmeric. Studying the hypolipidemic, antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties of the spices, the researchers compared the modulating effect that these spices have on metabolic syndrome and oxidative stress of diabetic rats. Injected with streptozotocin nicotinamide, the rats in the study were induced with diabetes. In the study, the diabetic rats were divided into four groups and examined for 28 days. One group was given 200 mg/kg body weight of garlic bulb. The other groups were given equal amounts of ginger root, turmeric root or a combination of the three herbs. The mixtures were administered in distilled water. "
0," The recent decision by Whole Foods Market to label all genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) sold in its stores by the long-off date of 2018 looks silly and almost meaningless compared to the right-now policy of fresh food chain Chipotle, which is officially the first and only major U.S. food supplier to voluntarily label GMOs. On its 'Ingredients Statement' website, Chipotle clearly outlines which of its food products contain GMOs, and also states that it is working aggressively to source completely non-GMO ingredients for all of its products as it moves forward. Chipotle has always marketed itself as a healthy alternative to fast food, having taken steps from the beginning to eliminate things like dairy products produced using the artificial growth hormone rBST, for instance, and replacing them with pasture-raised dairy products. Chipotle has also played a key role in propelling forward the local agriculture movement by sourcing as many locally-grown and organic ingredients as possible, and eliminating artificial additives and other toxins commonly used in fast food. But now Chipotle has set the bar even higher, and by choice, delineating each and every ingredient used in its meats, beans, rice, and dressings, and clarifying which ones contain GMOs. The primary GMO offender, as you will notice on Chipotle's 'Ingredients Statement' page, is soybean oil, which is reluctantly used in several of the chain's meat and rice products. In fact, this commercial frying and cooking oil appears to be one of the only, if not the only, GMO ingredient still used by Chipotle . 'Our goal is to eliminate GMOs from Chipotle's ingredients, and we're working hard to meet this challenge,' explains the page. 'For example, we recently switched our fryers from soybean oil to sunflower oil. Soybean oil is almost always made from genetically modified soybeans, while there is no commercially available GMO sunflower oil. Where our food contains currently unavoidable GM ingredients, it is only in the form of corn or soy.' You can view the Chipotle 'Ingredients Statement' page at the following link. Note that all items containing a 'G' in the pink box contain GMOs: http://www.chipotle.com Whole Foods' track record on GMOs an embarrassment to the health freedom movement While much of what Chipotle sells still admittedly contains GMOs in the form of corn and soybean oil, the company's willingness to be forthcoming with its customers and the public about this fact is highly commendable. And it is a lot more than we can say for Whole Foods Market, which is still not being completely honest with its customers. The fact that Chipotle is already voluntarily labeling GMOs, and clearly indicating its intent to continue phasing them out right now , shows that Whole Foods' 2018 labeling deadline is more of a political move to save face than a practical move to actually get the job done. Other health food retailers like Trader Joe's have already phased GMOs out of their private label brands ( http://www.traderjoes.com/about/customer-updates-responses.asp?i=4 ), while health food stores like Natural Grocers source only organic produce and require that their packaged food suppliers fully disclose the source of any potential GMO ingredients. Natural Grocers even states directly on its website that, as a company, it does not consider GMOs to be at all safe for human consumption ( http://www.naturalgrocers.com ). But Whole Foods, despite being a prominent leader in health food industry, has long taken the most ambiguous stance on GMOs. Besides its recent GMO labeling announcement and adoption of Non-GMO Project labeling back in 2009, both of which are commendable in their own rite, Whole Foods has not been nearly as forthcoming with its customers about GMOs , and yet continues to charge a premium for its products. While eventual labeling in 2018 may still be a positive step forward, it clearly lacks the proactive approach already being taken by companies like Chipotle. "
0," Tweet Losing a modest amount of weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity reduces the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) in women with prediabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet diabetic. This finding comes from a new study, published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, of women who participated in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a landmark clinical study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Launched in 1995, the DPPs main results were announced in 2001 and reported in 2002 (http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/feb2002/hhs-06.htm): losing 5 to 7 percent of weight through diet and a consistent increase in physical activity (e.g., walking 5 days a week 30 minutes a day) reduced the onset of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Treatment with metformin lowered the chances of developing diabetes by 31 percent. To combat the dual epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, Americans need to know about the proven benefits of losing some weight through calorie reduction and increased physical activity, said NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. The DPP randomly assigned 3,234 overweight people with higher-than-normal blood glucose levels to one of three approaches to prevent type 2 diabetes: dietary changes and increased physical activity aimed at a 7-percent weight loss; treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin; or placebo. The last two groups were also given standard medical advice about diet and weight loss. In the study, 660 women were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle changes, 636 to metformin treatment, and 661 to placebo. Their average age was 50 years old, with an average body mass index of 35 (e.g., a 5 4 woman weighing 204 pounds). Women who implemented intensive lifestyle changes and lost 5 to 7 percent of their weight had fewer episodes of weekly incontinence compared to those in the metformin or placebo groups (38 percent vs. 48 percent vs. 46 percent, respectively.) Our findings reinforce the DPPs good news about the benefits of modest weight loss. A 200-pound woman who loses 10 to 15 pounds not only lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also improves bladder control, said lead author Jeanette S. Brown, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco. If youre a woman at risk for type 2 diabetes, preventing or delaying diabetes and improving bladder control are powerful reasons to make these lifestyle changes. Weight loss was particularly effective in reducing episodes of stress incontinence leakage of small amounts of urine during physical movement, such as coughing, sneezing, and exercising. Stress incontinence results, in large part, from a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Though researchers do not fully understand all the factors contributing to stress incontinence, it is linked to obesity, diabetes, and other conditions, such as pregnancy, which increase pressure on the pelvic floor. In the DPP participants, weight loss did not alleviate urge incontinence leakage of urine at unexpected times. Urge incontinence is more closely linked to overactive nerves that control the bladder, sometimes triggering inappropriate contractions. More than 13 million people in the United States, mostly middle-aged and older women, experience loss of bladder control. Overweight women and those with type 2 diabetes have a 50- to 70-percent increased risk of incontinence. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 sample, one out of three women with diabetes or prediabetic glucose levels reported weekly or more frequent episodes of UI. Some studies have reported that increased physical activity worsens incontinence, but DPP participants randomly assigned to lifestyle changes, who typically chose walking as their physical activity, did not have increased problems with incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a costly, socially isolating condition that impairs quality of life and takes a psychological toll on many women. For women at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing a modest amount of weight is likely to alleviate incontinence, especially stress incontinence, said Leroy Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which funded the study. Nearly 21 million people in the United States 7 percent of the population have diabetes, the most common cause of blindness, kidney failure, and amputations in adults and a major cause of heart disease and stroke. Type 2 diabetes accounts for up to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in the last 30 years, due mostly to the upsurge in obesity. In addition, about 40 percent of U.S. adults ages 40 to 74 41 million people have prediabetes, which raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The NIDDK funds a great deal of research to improve the treatment and prevention of diabetes and urologic disorders. These efforts include the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (http://www.uitn.net/) and the Specialized Center of Research on Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction in women, a multidisciplinary translational research center at the University of California, San Francisco (http://www.ucsf.edu/scor). Recently, NIDDKs Central Repository (https://www.niddkrepository.org), which houses data collected in large clinical trials funded by the Institute, made data from the DPP available to researchers free of charge. The NIDDK also sponsors 'Let's Talk about Bladder Control for Women,' a campaign to inform women about treatments for incontinence, from pelvic floor exercises to surgery. For more information, call 1-800-891-5388 or see http://www.niddk.nih.gov. The National Diabetes Education Program (http://www.ndep.nih.gov/), jointly sponsored by the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 200 partner organizations, is disseminating the DPPs good news through its education campaign, 'Small Steps. Big Rewards. Prevent type 2 diabetes.'

0," Mercury based thimerosal is used as a preservative to 'kill organisms.' Aren't humans organisms? You have to be unconscious, brainwashed or just plain stupid to allow this into your or your child's body. The majority of flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury, an amount considered unsafe by the EPA for anyone weighing less than 550 pounds. Now then, take the two-shot recommendation and you receive 50 micrograms of toxic mercury. Have you ever met an 1,100 pound pregnant lady or baby? But Big Pharma money talks louder than dead babies, so go ahead, get your toxic flu shot. The U.S. government can't even agree among its own agencies about toxic mercury-based thimerosal used in vaccines. The Institute of Medicine advises that mercury-containing vaccines should NOT be injected into pregnant women, infants and children because of thimerosal's harmful effects on the immune, metabolic and nervous systems which has been widely documented. But that's not what the hired gun Dr. Jay Lieberman told the CDC. Lieberman has been a consultant to Merck, GlaxoSmithKline , and Sanofi-Pasteur , and is on the speakers' bureau for all three vaccine-makers. All three of these Big Pharmas are currently using thimerosal in their products and Lieberman made a presentation to the CDC, ignoring the bulk of peer-reviewed research, but rather touting a small number of industry-backed, highly criticized and flawed epidemiological studies that cited no harmful associations. As far back as July 7, 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) issued a joint statement that because of the 'neuro-developmental effects posed by exposure to thimerosal...thimerosal-containing vaccines should be removed as soon as possible.' This has not been done to date. Mercury levels have been lowered in some infant vaccines but according to Dr. Boyd Haley of the University of Kentucky, mercury is still present in all child vaccines. Even a question and answer segment on the CDC website back in 1999 goes thusly: 'Q: Who is most vulnerable to mercury? A: Two groups are most vulnerable to methyl mercury: the fetus and children ages 14 and younger.' Of course, this contradictory embarrassment has been long-since removed from the CDC website but is easily found on other websites like: http://www.cidpusa.org/pregnantVaccines.htm Children who receive the flu vaccine have three times the risk of hospitalization for flu In a study to determine if flu vaccines reduced hospitalizations in all children, children were evaluated at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota from six months to 18 years of age, all of whom had prior laboratory-confirmed influenza. It was found that vaccinated children had three times the risk of hospitalization compared to unvaccinated children along with a significantly higher risk for hospitalized-vaccinated asthmatics. Children who get the flu vaccine are more at risk for hospitalization than ones who do not get the vaccine , according to research presented at the 105th International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in San Diego. Should you get a flu shot or not? If you had your flu shot last year, you are twice as likely to contract swine flu this year according to a Canadian study and William Douglass MD. Pandemrix caused a 17-fold increase in narcolepsy among flu-vaccinated children in one study and Dr. Hugh Fundenberg and colleagues discovered that people at 55 years of age who receive the flu vaccine each year for five years in a row, increase their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease a whopping 1,000 percent . Another study published in The Lancet reported that flu vaccines do nothing in 98.5 percent of adults but do cause neurological disorders in 7.5 percent of vaccinated people. There is no proof that flu vaccines drop the level of flu occurrence but there is proof that they cause side effects and harm, but the choice is still yours. Make an informed one. "
0," The FDA has effectively banned a naturally-occurring form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxamine by declaring it to be a drug, reports the American Association for Health Freedom . Responding to a petition filed by a drug company, the FDA declared pyridoxamine to be 'a new drug.' Now, any nutritional supplements containing pyridoxamine will be considered adulterated and illegal by the FDA, which may raid vitamin companies and seize such products. See the history of FDA raids on vitamin companies here: http://www.selfnews.com/021791.html Pyridoxamine occurs naturally in fish, chicken and other foods ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6 ), putting the FDA in the strange position of banning a substance from dietary supplements even though it is already present in the food supply. The FDA's war on Mother Nature It's not the first time the FDA has declared a natural molecule to be a 'drug' while attacking nutritional supplements that contain the same molecule. A similar story unfolded with red yeast rice and the lovastatin molecules it contains that lower high cholesterol. The drug companies engaged in biopiracy, ripping off the molecule from red yeast rice to make their now-famous 'statin drugs.' Once the statin drugs were patented, Big Pharma and the FDA went after red yeast rice, claiming the supplement was 'adulterated with pharmaceuticals.' It wasn't really adulterated, of course. It just contained a natural statin-drug-like molecule that the drug companies copied and patented. It would be like Big Pharma patenting vitamin C, then the FDA claiming that all oranges and lemons were adulterated with drugs because they naturally contain their own vitamin C. This is the insanity of the FDA as it operates today. You can read more about the FDA on our channel webiste www.FDAreform.org which is updated every few days. So will this ruling on pyridoxamine affect nutritional supplements? Yes, any supplements containing this form of vitamin B6 can now be declared 'adulterated' by the FDA. Manufacturers of such supplements can be arrested and shut down for engaging in 'illegal drug trafficking.' Such is the nature of the FDA's agenda to criminalize nutritional supplement companies and limit consumers' access to Mother Nature's remedies. The pyridoxamine 'drug,' by the way (which is just pyridoxamine), is designed to prevent the progression of diabetic nephrothapy (kidney disease). Most likely, the FDA will eventually approve the 'drug' for that condition, even while claiming vitamin B6 supplements containing the very same chemical are useless and insert. This is another classic oppression tactic of the FDA: Ban the herb, but promote the drug using the same chemicals. The same thing happened with ephedra, a Traditional Chinese Medicine herb known as ma huang . The FDA banned the herb, saying it was 'dangerous at any dose,' but pharmaceuticals containing the very same molecules (ephedrine) are still being sold over-the-counter as cold medicines, meaning they're available to any child without a prescription. The bottom line is this: FDA approvals and bans have nothing to do with science and everything to do with protecting drug companies profits . If a drug company can make money selling a vitamin as a drug, the FDA will gladly ban the vitamin and protect the drug. If a drug company can rip off molecules from Mother Nature and patent them, the FDA will ban those same molecules found in nature. All of this points to the urgent need to reform the FDA. A new petition demanding real FDA reform will be announced here on selfnews in the coming days. Sources for this story include: AAHF: http://aahf.nonprofitsoapbox.com/index.php?o...

0," If you believe that you are at the mercy of your genetic code, great news, you're not. According to the science of epigenetics (the study of how environmental factors outside of DNA influence changes in gene expression), stem cells and even DNA can be altered through magnetic fields, heart coherence, positive mental states and intention. Top scientists around the world agree: genetic determinism is a flawed theory. Curbing the genetic victim mentality The DNA we are born with is not the sole determinant for our health and well-being. Stem cell biologist Bruce Lipton, Ph.D., discusses the important difference between genetic determinism and epigenetics in an interview with SuperConsciousness magazine: 'The difference between these two is significant because this fundamental belief called genetic determinism literally means that our lives, which are defined as our physical, physiological and emotional behavioral traits, are controlled by the genetic code. This kind of belief system provides a visual picture of people being victims: If the genes control our life function, then our lives are being controlled by things outside of our ability to change them. This leads to victimization that the illnesses and diseases that run in families are propagated through the passing of genes associated with those attributes. Laboratory evidence shows this is not true.' Lipton's theory is confirmed by Carlo Ventura, M.D., Ph.D., professor and researcher at the University of Bologna in Italy. Dr. Ventura has shown through lab testing that the DNA of stem cells can be altered using magnetic field frequencies. 'It's like a time machine. You're reprogramming somehow backward with these cells to an uncertain state in which any kind of decision is somehow possible; even the decision to become virtually any kind of cell of the organism. And just think about the tremendous potential of this discovery.' He adds that two Nobel Prize-winning scientists discovered even 'nonstem adult cells can be epigenetically reprogrammed backward to a state where they can eventually give rise to neural cells, cardiac cells, skeletal muscle cells or insulin-producing cells.' Changing DNA through intention According to the Institute of HeartMath in Boulder Creek, California, epigenetics encompasses far more than just DNA, our environment and life experience. After two decades of study, the researchers discovered factors like love and appreciation or anxiety and anger also influence a person's blueprint. In one experiment, select participants were able to change DNA with positive mental states. 'An individual holding three DNA samples was directed to generate heart coherence - a beneficial state of mental, emotional and physical balance and harmony - with the aid of a HeartMath technique that utilizes heart breathing and intentional positive emotions. The individual succeeded, as instructed, to intentionally and simultaneously unwind two of the DNA samples to different extents and leave the third unchanged.' Control group volunteers who had low heart coherence were unable to alter the DNA. Healthy cell expression and a quantum nutrient diet If we want to nourish our bodies at a cellular level (and not promote disease), the institute recommends an abundant diet of quantum nutrients. When we are stressed or negative, our biological energy reserves are diverted from the important task of regenerating and repairing the body. We can counteract this cellular starvation by focusing on genuine states of care, appreciation and love. These positive emotions enhance our energy system and feed the body, even down to the level of DNA. HeartMath calls such positive feelings 'quantum nutrients.' The institute offers several free tools that assist in creating a coherent state quickly and easily. Two examples can be found here and here .

0," Eliminating foods and food combinations that trigger IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) symptoms is the first step toward coping with IBS. Eventually, coping can lead to healing. However, relying on conventional, mainstream medicine will put you into a life of coping with the side effects and dependency of their prescribed pharmaceutical meds. It's better to take responsibility through proper diet decisions and improve IBS conditions with natural herbs such as triphala, aloe vera, and others. ( http://www.helpforibs.com/supplements/herbs1.asp ) It's also important to eliminate Crohn's disease, Candida yeast overgrowth, or IBD (inflammatory bowel disorder) as a source of your symptoms with unusual and sporadic bowel movements, bloating, digestive discomfort, and abdominal pain. IBS is considered a syndrome, not a disease. It's a brain-gut dysfunction consisting of spastic colon reactions from abnormal neurological impulses that are easily aggravated by certain foods and food combinations as well as stress. Search for a holistic MD, holistic chiropractor, or naturopath that understands gut and IBS problems. If accessible in your area, Chinese medicine offers solutions with acupuncture and herbs. Ayurveda also has answers for IBS and other gastrointestinal issues. A method of self hypnosis for IBS brain-gut dysfunction is available. It has had positive results. Some claim it is the only definitive IBS cure. ( http://www.helpforibs.com/hypnosis/selfhyp1.asp ) But EFT (emotional freedom techniques) tapping has also helped many. This is because IBS sufferers have traumatized nervous systems that respond unusually with certain triggers that don't affect most. Apparently, the gut's second brain connection is affected by the brain first instead of the other way around. IBS sufferers have short circuited gastrocolic reactions that trigger colon spasms or contractions only moments after ingesting. The food doesn't need to enter the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract before registering an abnormal colon response of diarrhea or constipation. Knowing this can help identify IBS triggers more easily. That's why soluble food fibers, which dissolve in water and form a gel, establish a foundation for IBS sufferers. Their gels sooth and pack the colon with a cushion to minimize spasms of diarrhea and help smooth expulsion for constipation issues. Non-soluble fiber foods have to play a secondary, minor role. Complete lists of soluble fiber and insoluble fiber foods are linked to in the sources section below this article. Proper food combining (1) Eat fruit alone, away from food, either an hour before or two hours after. Make sure it's a soluble fiber fruit, such as bananas, peeled apples, mangoes, or papayas. Insoluble fiber fruits may be tolerated if eaten after soluble fiber fruits. Insoluble fiber on an empty stomach is problematic for IBS sufferers. (2) The accepted starch and protein combination no-no for everyone can apply on a limited basis for IBS folks. Grains like pasta, bread or rice and potatoes with meat, poultry or fish. People with IBS-D (diarrhea) should try to split those two types up because the enzyme requirement for each is different. (3) If a starch contains soluble fibers, it's usually okay to mix it with some animal or legume proteins. White rice, potatoes, and sweet potatoes are starchy, but they contain soluble fibers that form a gel in the intestines and help inhibit IBS reactions. (4) Soluble fiber veggies should be eaten before an insoluble fiber salad. (5) Many animal foods and heavy fats that are difficult to digest should be completely avoided until one is out of the woods with IBS. Ditto for caffeine and alcohol. (6) Soaking legumes overnight helps remove the complex sugars that can agitate IBS. It also minimizes the beans' cooking time. Whole grain rices (brown rice) can be soaked overnight as well to minimize phytates or phytic acid, which tend to block mineral absorption and perhaps agitate IBS reactions. "
0," Tweet TUCSON, Ariz. - An independent consumer health advocate is launching a public education campaign to give women genuine cancer prevention information while challenging the 'corporatization' of the breast cancer industry and its harmful system of screening and treatment with organ-damaging chemotherapy. The Education Not Medication campaign, hosted by independent health news website NewsTarget.com and launched by consumer health advocate Mike Adams (found at http://www.newstarget.com/020841.html ) gives women clear, concise information to help them explore natural solutions for preventing breast cancer. The campaign also explains why today's breast cancer industry is more interested in cancer profits than cancer prevention, and why breast cancer screening has been scientifically shown to harm ten times as many women as it helps. Breast cancer screening does nothing to educate women how to really prevent breast cancer, nor does it teach women how to change their diets and lifestyles so that breast cancer never develops in the first place,' Adams said. 'In fact, mammograms have been proven to actually cause breast cancer by irradiating breast tissue, causing DNA mutations in breast cells.' Education Not Medication is raising the awareness of both the things that cause breast cancer and the things that prevent it. NewsTarget.com lists 22 things that prevent breast cancer, 18 things that contribute to breast cancer, and offers web stickers of various sizes for those who wish to help publicize the Education Not Medication program. There is no commercial agenda behind this public education program, and no nutritional products are being sold. The campaign is purely based on educating women on simple solutions for preventing breast cancer . In the conventional cancer industry, there's no real effort in place to teach women how to prevent breast cancer, Adams says. When it comes to breast cancer prevention, the cancer industry is practically silent. Its time to raise cancer prevention awareness by teaching women how to prevent cancer, instead of waiting for cancer to emerge so that it can be treated with life-threatening toxic chemicals.

0," One hundred forty children and 10 staff members at Boston's Condon Elementary School are among the latest to be impacted by a possible norovirus outbreak. There were concerns that parents and those using the school for community activities such as voting may have been put at risk, but according to a spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, it's believed that cause for concern is unnecessary, as the school was thoroughly cleaned. (1) Cleanliness is essential when it comes to staving off and fighting norovirus, something which principal Robby Chisholm is taking seriously. Additional soap, hand sanitizer and wipes are more commonplace in the school now. Furthermore, Chisholm has been involved in ongoing communication with parents, sending informative flyers to students' homes and providing them with messages at the onset of the virus's spread. When the outbreak first occurred, she told parents that 'Teams were onsite today cleaning the school so we can stop any further illness spread. For those of you who have children who are ill, we will make sure to catch them up on their schoolwork when they come back -- we just want them to focus on getting healthy soon.' (1) It was also advised that childrenwho were sickened with norovirus should remain home until they are free of symptoms, which typically include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea, for 24 hours. The virus is transmitted through contaminated food and water supplies, as well as person-to-person contact, and is commonly spread in areas where there are closely confined quarters such as schools, cruise ships, prisons and camps. (2) Norovirus has hit other schools recently This isn't the first time norovirus has hit school systems. This October, a foodborne illness was eyed as playing a role in a suspected outbreak in Indiana's Peifer Elementary School, where nearly 130 students were sickened and remained out of school . (3) Like Condon Elementary School, utmost attention to cleanliness was given priority, and a cleaning solution provided by the Department of Health was used virtually everywhere in the school. 'We are cleaning with a solution that was provided to us by the Department of Health,' a Peifer school official said. 'Anything that moves: doorknobs, desks, computer screens, lunchroom tables, the entire building.' (3) Also in October, over 100 students in Arizona's Kyrene de la Colina Elementary School were sickened with norovirus. (4) Cruise ships another common place for norovirus outbreaks The cruiseliner industry is another hotbed of norovirus activity. In February 2014, passengers and crew members aboard Holland America's MS Veendam cruise ship fell ill, suffering from diarrhea and vomiting. In response, environmental health experts and an epidemiologist boarded the 1,273-passenger-carrying ship once it docked in Florida, where they began health assessments and testing. It was ultimately determined that the 16-year-old ship had been involved in similar outbreaks throughout the years and that it failed when it came to sanitation issues, including the discovery of brown liquid that was dripping on clean dishes. (5) In 2013, two cruise ships, the Emerald Princess and the Queen Mary 2 ocean liners, drew attention when upwards of 200 passengers (aboard each ship) were sickened with diarrhea and vomiting symptoms. (2) How to boost immunity naturally To help improve immunity and fight against viruses like norovirus, cleanliness is essential, but turning to common home remedies may also be effective. For example, drinking more water to stay hydrated and fight off dehydration due to diarrhea is encouraged, as is consumption of peppermint tea, coconut water beverages and apple cider vinegar, all of which can help boost immunity, soothe upset stomach and bolster antimicrobial function throughout the body.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent study from Pennsylvania State University utilized hidden ingredients in recipes, aimed at lowering calorie content, and evaluated participants' responses to the hidden ingredients. Researchers used hidden pureed vegetables to decrease calorie content in meals in order to determine if participants would feel satisfied with the lower calorie intake. Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber and nutrients leading to satiation and weight loss. Although weight loss was not a factor in this study, other studies have found positive association with increased vegetable intake and subsequent weight loss. In the study conducted at Pennsylvania State University participants were assigned to three different groups. Food intake was controlled by weight so all groups consumed the same volume of food. In the groups receiving pureed vegetables, one was designed with about 200 less calories and the other group had 357 fewer calories. Even though weight loss was not a factor in this study, a reduction of nearly 360 calories per day could lead to a loss of about one pound every 10 days. The important aspect of the study was the satiation of the subjects and whether or not they enjoyed the food with pureed vegetables. In the survey all participants reported that they enjoyed the taste of the food regardless of whether or not they could taste the pureed vegetables. Despite the lowered calorie intake, all participants reported that they felt satisfied by the meals they were served. The researchers concluded that adding a significant amount of vegetables in the diet can lead to lower overall calorie intake. Decreasing calorie density of meals by adding nutrient rich vegetables is a healthy way to approach weight management without compromising satiety. A study published in the International Journal of Obesity looked at over 74,000 women and found those with the largest increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables had a 24% lower risk of obesity. Another 10 year follow up study from Spain found that increased fruit and vegetable consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of medium weight gain. The researchers in this study concluded that increased fruit and vegetable intake should be vigorously promoted to prevent obesity. The biggest obstacle to increasing fruit and vegetable intake is not the knowledge of their efficacy in improved health and weight loss ; it is the fact that Americans simply refuse to do so. Richard Mattes Professor of Foods and Nutrition at Purdue University observed: in several unrelated but similar studies, even though participants lost weight they claimed they would not continue the diet at home. The reasons they stated were that they would not spend the money on the vegetables nor would they spend the time to prepare them. Utilizing the calorie reducing power of vegetable purees is simple. Pureed steamed cauliflower can be used in cream sauces; pureed carrots can be used in tomato based sauces; and green leafy vegetables can be pureed in soups, stews, and smoothies. The key to successful weight loss is to decrease calorie density by adding more fruits and vegetables in the diet while decreasing consumption of processed calorie laden foods. The studies available offer excellent insight into the dietary changes necessary to combat obesity; it is merely the choice of the individual whether or not this knowledge will create change.

0," When natural health advocates warn against mainstream medicine's arsenal of weapons used to fight cancer, including chemotherapy and radiation, their concerns often revolve around how these therapies can weaken and damage a person's body in numerous ways. But scientists are finding other reasons to question some of these therapies. It turns out that while chemotherapies may kill or shrink tumors in the short term, they may actually be causing malignancies to grow more deadly in the long term. For example, selfnews previously reported ( http://www.selfnews.com/029042_cancer_cells_chemotherapy.html ) that scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center and UAB Department of Chemistry are currently investigating the very real possibility that dead cancer cells left over after chemotherapy spark cancer to spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). And now comes news that a little-explored specific cell type, the pericyte, found in what is called the microenvironment of a cancerous tumor actually may halt cancer progression and metastasis. And by destroying these cells, some anti-cancer therapies may inadvertently be making cancer more aggressive as well as likely to spread and kill. A study just published in the January 17 issue of the journal Cancer Cell concludes that anti-angiogenic therapies (which shrink cancer by cutting off tumors' blood supply) may be killing the body's natural defense against cancer by destroying pericyte cells that likely serve as important gatekeepers against cancer progression and metastasis. Pericytes cover blood vessels and support their growth. For the new research, Raghu Kalluri, MD, PhD, Chief of the Division of Matrix Biology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), investigated whether targeting pericytes could inhibit tumor growth in the same way that other antiangiogenic cancer drugs do. Dr. Kalluri and his research team worked with mice genetically engineered to support drug-induced depletion of pericytes in growing tumors. Next, they removed pericytes in implanted mouse breast cancer tumors , decreasing pericyte numbers by 60 percent. Compared with control animals, there was a 30 percent decrease in the size of cancerous tumors over 25 days. But there was a serious catch to these results. Contrary to conventional mainsteam medical wisdom, the scientists discovered the number of secondary lung tumors in the engineered mice had increased threefold compared to the control mice, indicating that the tumors had metastasized. How cancer drugs can spread cancer cells 'If you just looked at tumor growth, the results were good,' Dr. Kalluri said in a press statement. 'But when you looked at the whole picture, inhibiting tumor vessels was not controlling cancer progression. The cancer was, in fact, spreading. This suggested to us that without supportive pericytes, the vasculature inside the tumor was becoming weak and leaky -- even more so than it already is inside most tumors-- and this was reducing the flow of oxygen to the tumor.' That change, he explains, makes cancer cells more mobile, so they can travel through those leaky vessels to new locations. It also makes cancer cells behave more like stem cells, so they are better able to survive. Because cancer therapies such as Imatinib, Sunitinib and others are known to decrease pericytes in tumors, the scientists next carried out the same experiments in mice with primary tumors. Only this time, they used the chemotherapy drugs Imatinib and Sunitinib instead of genetic programs to decrease pericyte numbers. Both Imatinib and Sunitinib caused 70 percent pericyte depletion -- and they also increased metastasis threefold. In order to see if their findings are relevant to human patients, the research team examined 130 breast cancer tumor samples of varying cancer stages and tumor sizes and compared pericyte levels with prognoses. The result? The samples with low numbers of pericytes in tumor vasculature correlated with the most deeply invasive cancers, distant metastasis and five to ten year survival rates less than 20 percent. 'These results are quite provocative and will influence clinical programs designed to target tumor angiogenesis,' Ronald A. DePinho, president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said in a press statement. 'These impressive studies will inform and refine potential therapeutic approaches for many cancers.' For more information: http://www.bidmc.org/ "
0," As has been the case in nearly every other mass shooting in the U.S. and around the world in recent years, it has been learned that the shooter in Chattanooga who killed four Marines and a Navy sailor at a recruiting center was on dangerous mood-altering drugs. As reported by ABC News , Mohammod Youssef Abdulazeez, 24, was facing a criminal charge, had been having suicidal thoughts as well as thoughts about becoming 'a martyr,' and had been taking both prescription and non-prescription drugs, including opioids and painkillers. The news network further reported: [A] diary belonging to the gunman and FBI interviews with his parents paint a picture of a disturbed, suicidal young man using drugs, preparing for bankruptcy and facing an appearance in criminal court, according to a representative of the shooter' s family. ... In a downward spiral, Abdulazeez would abuse sleeping pills, opioids, painkillers and marijuana, along with alcohol, the representative said. The common link There were other factors that authorities and friends believe may have contributed to Abdulazeez's murders, including trips to Jordan, where some believe the previously not-so-devout Muslim may have become radicalized. But the mood-altering drug connection cannot be ignored, since it is the one common denominator in nearly all of the mass shootings in the United States dating back to the Columbine High School murders in the late 1990s. Click here to search GoodGopher.com for psych drug shooters. According to the web site Psych Drug Shooters , Abdulazeez a native of Kuwait suffered from depression since he was a child. He began seeing a psychiatrist around the age of 12 or 13, and of course was medicated as part of his treatment. He graduated from college with an engineering degree but lost his job at a nuclear power facility because he failed a drug test (marijuana). He becomes merely the latest drug-crazed shooter. Dylann Roof, 21, charged with the racially motivated shooting deaths of nine people at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston just weeks ago had been arrested twice before. During one arrest, police found 'orange strips,' which Roof admitted were 'suboxone,' a Schedule 3 narcotic that is prescribed as a step-down drug for the treatment of opiate and painkiller addiction. Incidentally, as news broke about Abdulazeez's mind-altering drug connection, selfnews published a story noting that nearly all psychotropic drug use is unnecessary , according to a doctor currently researching the 'medical holocaust' that such drug use has caused. According to reporter Jonathan Benson, the study which was published in the British Medical Journal , found: More than half a million people age 65 years or older die every year in the West from psychiatric drug use, and the worst part is that these death pills aren't even effective at treating either mental illness or depression. Researchers from Denmark's Nordic Cochrane Centre found that the benefits of psych drugs are minimal at best, and that most people who currently use them would be better off just ditching them entirely. More killings will occur as long as these medications are handed out selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, linked five of the most recent mass shooting incidents involving Dylann Roof, James Holmes, Adam Lanza, Michael Carneal and Kip Kinkel to psychotropic drug use, adding that he has reported on the link for over a decade. Others are also pointing out the link. In this report , Dan Roberts of AmmoLand.com says the trend dates back at least 20 years. But not all of the killing is murder: Nearly every mass shooting incident in the last twenty years, and multiple other instances of suicide and isolated shootings all share one thing in common, and it's not the weapons used. The overwhelming evidence points to the signal largest common factor in all of these incidents is the fact that all of the perpetrators were either actively taking powerful psychotropic drugs or had been at some point in the immediate past before they committed their crimes. One other thing is certain: As long as these drugs are passed out like candy, more of these killings will occur.

0," Most people aren't aware of this fact, but thousands of commercial airline pilots routinely bring loaded guns onto airplanes and fly with those guns in their possession, right on the flight deck. This is perfectly legal, and the guns are all privately-owned by the pilots themselves. In 2008, there were nearly 10,000 gun-possessing airline pilots in America, and the number continues to grow. Up to 90,000 airline crewmembers are eligible to carry a firearm on airplanes during passenger flights, according to USA Today . These guns provide a huge deterrent against hijackers and terrorists, as they allow highly-trained pilots to return fire and potentially kill hijackers before they can take control of the airplane and turn it into a weapon. I find it fascinating that anti-gun people ('gun grabbers') routinely fly on planes flown by armed pilots carrying loaded guns. By definition, all gun-grabbers should refuse to fly because they don't trust 'citizens with guns.' In their view, pilots cannot be trusted with guns even though pilots are already trusted with the entire airplane and therefore hold the lives of hundreds of passengers in their hands at any moment. Under Dianne Feinstein's proposed gun control legislation , U.S. airline pilots would be forced to surrender their guns to the government and fly with no gun protection whatsoever . This would make airplanes 'gun free zones' and cause them to be prime targets for psychopathic criminals in the same way that public schools are easy targets right now. Taking away guns from responsible citizens like airline pilots sends a clear message to criminals: It's open season! Smuggle a weapon onto an airplane, and it's all yours! U.S. Senators to cause another 9/11 airplane hijacking? In this way, Dianne Feinstein's gun control measure would actually set up America for another 9/11-style terrorist attack by disarming responsible airline pilots and making airplanes vulnerable to armed hijackers. FAA security tests reveal that efforts to sneak bombs and firearms onto airplanes succeed 95% of the time . Does Feinstein have no understanding of the fact that disarming all the law-abiding citizens only creates a risk-free shooting range for criminals? If the Sandy Hook massacre is an example of a small-scale gun-free zone, imagine what will happen if Senators and lawmakers vote to make the entire country a 'gun-free zone.' We'll be looking at mass hijackings, home burglaries, robberies, murders and rapes at record numbers, all across the country. Armed criminals are rooting for Dianne Feinstein The sooner she can shove gun control through Congress, the sooner it's open season on innocent victims and airline hijackings. The one thing armed criminals really want is for law-abiding citizens to be completely disarmed. If you believe the 9/11 terrorism narrative, then you also have to believe that terrorists can't wait for pilots to be disarmed by new laws so that airplanes can once again be easily hijacked and turned into weapons of mass death. Dianne Feinstein, Obama, Schumer and other anti-America gun grabbers are playing right into the hands of terrorists by pursuing gun control legislation. 50,000 armed pilots would make our skies far safer for everyone The answer to crime, of course, is to put more guns into the hands of good people . Airline surveys suggest that 50,000 pilots would gladly carry guns on airplanes if concealed carry rules were more streamlined for pilots. This would mean having 50,000 more 'good guys' armed against terrorists, hijackers and criminals. That would make our skies safer and far more resistant to crime. But shhhh! Don't tell the liberals that pilots are armed, or they may refuse to fly altogether. After all, they think that guns magically leap out of their holsters are start gunning down children automatically. 'Guns are bad,' they've said. And that must mean airline pilots who already carry those guns are bad, too. Also see: Video: Dianne Feinstein says turn in your guns, America! "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A study published in the Jan. 17 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that people can protect themselves from a type of polyp that leads to cancer -- recurrent colorectal adenomas -- for up to five years after discontinuing a daily calcium supplement regiment maintained for four years. A previous study had shown a link between daily calcium supplementation and reduced colorectal adenoma risk, and the recent follow-up study showed that the supplements continue to offer protection after patients discontinue use. Data from 587 patients who previously had at least one colonoscopy was analyzed for seven years after the conclusion of the previous study. At the five-year-mark, the former calcium users showed a 31.5 percent rate of adenoma formation, while the group who never used calcium supplements showed 43.2 percent growth, but no apparent effect on either group was noted after that time. The study also showed that the prior use of calcium supplements reduced advanced adenoma risk, but not in a way that was statistically significant. In an interview with Reuters, study co-author Dr. John A. Baron of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, New Hampshire, said he would like to see future researchers duplicate the results of his study, but noted it was too early to say calcium supplements were a viable way to prevent colorectal cancer. He added that the study turned up evidence that prostate cancer risk might be increased by calcium supplementation. 'I would urge consumers to supplement only with high-grade calcium sources, and avoid products like Tums which actually reduce stomach acid, interfering with the assimilation of minerals like calcium,' said Mike Adams, author of 'The 7 Laws of Nutrition' and a consumer health advocate. Adams said that calcium carbonate is a poor source of calcium, and that calcium citrate is better. The best sources, he said, include things like calcium malate, and he recommended consumers visit WellnessResources.com for 'very high-grade calcium.' 'The best way to take calcium is with acidic natural foods such as citrus or strawberries,' he said. 'A little vinegar, taken with calcium supplements, can also boost absorption and assimilation.' ### "
0," There are many unique factors such as life experience, social status, and family history that can drive a person towards a life of excess alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse. But one area that is almost never addressed as it pertains to alcohol abuse is malnutrition, and particularly a lack of proper nutrients for maintaining a healthy physical, mental, and emotional state. For many people, traditional rehabilitation techniques and weekly meetings with other alcohol abusers is not enough to kick the habit for good, as these methods typically address the symptoms rather than the root cause. Though there is no one-size-fits-all regimen for curing alcohol abuse, there are a number of natural approaches that can help bring about true recovery and healing that will last. Here are six ways to help naturally kick the alcohol habit and never look back: 1) Transactional analysis . The problem with modern medicine's approach to alcohol abuse is that the addiction is often classified as a disease known as 'alcoholism,' and treated accordingly. By attaching a formal name to this addiction and categorizing those who suffer from it as diseased, the tendency is for those who abuse alcohol to actually take ownership of their addiction and make it a core component of who they are as a person, which actually makes it more difficult for them to kick the habit. This is why many physicians who take a more naturopathic and holistic approach to health prefer Transactional Analysis (TA), a system of analyzing behaviors that avoids turning every addiction into a disease. TA, as explained by Dr. Carolyn Dean, M.D., N.D., encourages patients to take charge of their own healing, and recognize that their addiction is not a disease, but rather a symptom of some other underlying problem, which is typically emotional or physical in nature. And part of addressing such a problem includes kicking other bad habits such as poor diet. 'Establishing a good diet to improve and maintain better health would certainly be a major part of such a health-promoting plan of action,' explains Dr. Dean about the TA approach to curing alcohol abuse in a 2005 piece for NewsWithViews.com entitled Curing Alcoholism Naturally . 'In addition, it can improve a person's state of mind, as malnourishment can lead to depression and other emotional imbalances, not to mention muddled thinking.' A great book on the subject of treating alcohol abuse with TA is Healing Alcoholism , which you can access for free online: http://www.emotional-literacy.com/healing.htm 2) Niacin . Part of this nutrition-based healing process includes loading up on vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients in order to balance and maintain proper brain chemistry. And one of the most important nutrients for achieving this is niacin, also known as vitamin B3, according to one prominent expert on the subject. 'Niacin is the most important single treatment for alcoholism, and it is one of the most reliable treatments,' says orthomolecular medicine expert Dr. Abram Hoffer, M.D., Ph.D., about his Treatment Protocol for Alcoholism . You can read Dr. Hoffer's full paper on the subject here: http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n06.shtml 3) Mega-doses of vitamin C . In the same orthomolecular vein, vitamin C is critical for chemically neutralizing the toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism. As reported by The Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University (OSU), numerous studies have shown that vitamin C in high doses reduces oxidative stress as a result of alcohol consumption, and prevents alcohol-induced hyperlipidemia and lipid perodixation. The nutrient can also help eliminate alcohol addiction ( http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/f-w99/newresearch.html ). 'To titrate to saturation, take 1000 mg (milligrams) of vitamin C every hour,' explains Dr. Hoffer about how to effectively stop drinking alcohol and return to normal body function. 'When saturation is reached, there will be a single episode of diarrhea; then reduce the dosage to 1000 mg every four hours.' 4) Whole food-based B vitamin complex, sunflower lecithin . This same protocol also includes supplementing with a B vitamin complex six times daily that includes at least 50 mg each of the major B vitamins. Since many popular B vitamin complexes contain synthetic vitamins derived from petroleum sources, it is recommended that you supplement with a whole food-based B vitamin complex. Dr. Hoffer also suggests supplementing with two to four tablespoons of lecithin daily, as this relative of the B vitamin complex will fortify your body with necessary inositol and choline, as well as help mobilize fats out of the liver, which can become congested from alcohol abuse . We suggest using non-GMO sunflower lecithin rather than traditional soy lecithin. 5) L-glutamine . Part of kicking the alcohol habit involves eliminating alcohol cravings, which can be achieved through supplementation with the non-essential amino acid L-glutamine. According to Dr. Hoffer, L-glutamine decreases physiological cravings for alcohol, while also replacing what has been lost of the nutrients in the liver and kidneys as a result of alcohol abuse . The entire process will help reduce your cravings for both sugar and alcohol. 6) Chromium . Since many alcoholics are also hypoglycemic, it may be important to supplement with the mineral chromium as well. By taking between 200 to 400 mcg (micrograms) of chromium daily, alcohol abusers can help stabilize their blood sugar levels and balance out the body's metabolism of carbohydrates. "
0," Is disgraced NBC News anchor Brian Williams about to drop a dime on others in his industry who might have 'fabricated' stories or otherwise embellished during the recounting of their news coverage? It seems possible in light of a threat issued by the 55-year-old anchor to make his departure from the network 'really ugly,' say reports. Britain's Daily Mail noted that Williams is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he angles for a return to his nightly news reader desk, a source close to the network told the paper. The threats come on the heels of an internal inquiry report that found that Williams had lied repeatedly - at least 11 times - to make himself appear to be something he is not or was not. Williams was suspended from his anchor chair with no pay for six months in February after it was revealed that he provided false details regarding his presence aboard a U.S. military helicopter during the earliest days of the Iraq invasion. Williams said his chopper was hit by RPG fire over Iraq, which was patently untrue. Does Williams have the goods on other network liars? A source who is allegedly close to NBC News told the New York Post 's 'Page Six' that he 'is saying he's not going down without a fight and [is] threatening to make it really ugly - worse than Ann Curry.' Curry departed the network's Today show in 2013 amid an outpouring of negative publicity. As the Post noted, Curry made a teary-eyed, emotional on-air good-by as her co-host, Matt Lauer, looked on sheepishly. The Post further noted that both Curry and Williams are represented by 'pit bull lawyer' Williams & Connolly's Bob Barnett. 'They want Brian to resign,' said one source. 'If they have to fire him, they can't control him.' The rising tension between Williams and parent company NBCUniversal has become more evident lately. On April 24, NBC released its internal probe, which found the additional instances of Williams' embellishment. Three days later, the Post said, a report that was positive towards Williams just happened to surface stating that NBC News chief Andy Lack was looking for a way to save the disgraced anchor's job. However, days later, anti-Williams factions indicated to The Hollywood Reporter that Lack is not sure he can keep Williams or that the anchor will ever return. In Williams' absence, Lester Holt has been anchoring NBC Nightly News . The Post further reported that there is no question there is increasing urgency within NBCUniversal management ranks to get past the Williams episode, in large part because the nightly newscast's ratings are tanking. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.' ABC World News Tonight , which is hosted by David Muir, announced recently that it led NBC Nightly News in total viewers during the previous four weeks, which was the first time that had happened in years. In addition, ABC also won the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic for three straight weeks; that is the primary demographic sought by advertisers. NBC is ahead for the season so far, but clearly its market share is falling, and that is likely tied to the Williams disaster. The Post further noted: 'As talks between Williams and Comcast's NBCUniversal unit heat up, Williams is believed to be trying to ensure that he is entitled to a payout under the five-year, $10 million-per-year deal he signed last year .' 'They are not going to give him an opportunity to do an Ann Curry,' said a source familiar with news management. In addition, former Meet the Press anchor David Gregory has been kept off the air to prevent him from making any on-air remarks regarding Williams' departure. 'NBC seems intent on damaging him,' said a friend of Williams. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.'

0," The 'Food Safety Accountability Act' -- which was introduced last year by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), but died not long after due to significant opposition from the natural health community -- has been resurrected this year as bill S. 216. This new bill, which is slightly less of a threat to the natural food and supplement industries than its predecessor, still contains dangerously vague language that may easily be misused by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to target and threaten the natural health community. Your help is needed to help get the bill amended or killed altogether. The original bill, which was introduced last year as S. 3767, upped the penalty for 'misbranding' or 'adulterating' foods and supplements from a one-year maximum prison sentence to ten years. The major problem with this, however, is that 'adulterated' and 'misbranded' are two terms that the FDA has already manipulated and used to target various food and supplement companies that are selling safe, honestly-labeled products. Because of the vague wording in the bill, the FDA could have illegitimately used it to target practically any company it wanted to. A slight improvement, the new version of the bill has been revised to encompass only specific violators of certain sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C;), and who 'knowingly and intentionally' misbrand, adulterate, defraud, mislead, or otherwise deceive consumers. This wording helps to clarify whom the real target is, but it is still vague enough to be twisted by the FDA and used to terrorize honest producers and sellers of natural food and supplements. Obviously on the fast track, S. 3767 has already been passed in the Senate. But it has not yet been passed in the House, which means there is still time to stop it. In fact, a House version of the bill has yet to be introduced, which is why now is the time to oppose the bill in its current form.

0," Oil pulling, also called oil swishing, is an ancient Ayurvedic folk remedy that involves swishing oil around in your mouth to draw toxins from the body. Though oil pulling is usually recommended for treating mouth-based conditions such as halitosis, gingivitis or oral plaque, it actually benefits the entire body. Long-term oil pulling has, for instance, also been linked to healthier hair, clearer skin, whiter teeth, elimination of parasites, improved body odor and the easing of joint pains. It is, in short, a full-body cleanse, and anyone with $5 to spare on good-quality oil can reap its benefits. It isn't difficult to find instructions on how to pull oil online. However, many of them deviate greatly from the original protocols. What follows below, then, is a more authentic set of instructions for oil pulling that remain faithful to the original protocols yet are adapted for the modern lifestyle. Instructions Before you can start oil pulling, you will need the following items: 1.) Cold-pressed, organic sesame oil. If you cannot purchase (or tolerate) sesame oil, consider sunflower oil instead. These are the two 'warming' oils recommended by the Ayurveda. 2.) A spare toothbrush (separate from the one you normally use to brush your teeth). 3.) Himalayan crystal salt or unrefined sea salt. Once you have these items, you can begin by following these steps: 1.) Upon waking, swish the sesame oil around your mouth for between 15-20 minutes. You should do this before eating or drinking. When swishing, avoid gargling the oil . Instead, favor slow chomping and pulling motions, ensuring that the oil reaches all parts of your mouth. You'll probably find that the oil becomes thinner (and whiter) after the 10-minute mark, as it becomes increasingly loaded with toxins. 2.) After 15-20 minutes of swishing (your mouth might ache from the repetitive motions during the first few sessions), spit the oil into a toilet. For obvious reasons, the toxin-filled oil should never be swallowed. 3.) Mix a teaspoon of Himalayan salt or sea salt into some water and wash the solution around your mouth. This will help kill and flush out remaining toxins. 4.) You now have the choice to either repeat the process again, or end it by brushing your teeth . Repeating the process results in a much more aggressive cleanse (the second pull is often more effective than the first), so it might make you nauseous if you are new to the process. 5.) Clean your teeth gently using the spare toothbrush. You'll want to avoid using your normal toothbrush, because it's unlikely that the salt water will have removed all toxins clinging to the teeth and tongue. This means that the spare toothbrush will accumulate undesirable toxins over time and is unsuitable for casual brushing. 6.) Lastly, brush your teeth a second time using your normal toothbrush and your favorite toothpaste. This helps clean your teeth normally and also freshens your breath. Most people begin to experience whiter teeth and an improved mood within weeks of following this protocol. More significant and noticeable benefits will manifest months later, including a possible end to medical conditions that have plagued you for years. "
0," The Associated Press has declared war on alternative medicine, publishing a series of stories attacking everything from nutritional therapies to bioidentical hormones. These stories, which are syndicated across thousands of websites around the world, are prefaced with the following highly-opinionated 'Editor's Note': EDITOR'S NOTE: Ten years and $2.5 billion in research have found no cures from alternative medicine. Yet these mostly unproven treatments are now mainstream and used by more than a third of all Americans. This is one in an occasional series examining their use and potential risks. What this note reveals is an extraordinary bias against natural medicine from the start. It's clear from the claim of 'examining their use and potential risks' that the Associated Press isn't even looking for potential benefits of natural medicine. They're just looking to discredit it. And the part about 'Ten years and $2.5 billion in research have found no cures' is factually incorrect. To be more accurate, the statement should have said 'Ten years and $2.5 billion in research by pharmaceutical researchers who don't even know how to study something holistically have found no cures that they are willing to publicly acknowledge .' Because, in reality, natural medicine has provided the populations of the world with countless cures spanning thousands of years of indigenous use by billions of people. Oh, but wait... the Associated Press doesn't count that. The only evidence they will consider is 'proof' provided by researchers on the payroll of the criminally-operated pharmaceutical industry and rubber-stamped by a corrupt, racketeering U.S. Food and Drug Administration that unquestionably pushes a pro-pharma agenda at the expense of public health. In one story about alternative medicine , the Associated Press characterized the teaching of acupuncture as 'Harry Potter medicine.' The story criticizes acupuncture and demeans any mention of 'energy channels' even though acupuncture has been scientifically proven to be extremely effective at managing pain. There is no mention in the AP story of the published, peer-reviewed studies that promote acupuncture's proven effectiveness and safety. What happened to just reporting the truth? As I've stated here on selfnews many times, the whole system of 'evidence-based medicine' is biased against natural medicine from the start because the FDA maintains an official policy of declaring all plant-based medicines to be inert in the human body, regardless of how much scientific evidence demonstrates otherwise. In the FDA's eyes, there is no such thing as a food, herb, dietary supplement or nutrient that has any beneficial effect against any disease or health problem in the human body. And you know why? Because according to the FDA, only 'drugs' can be used to prevent, treat or reverse any disease or health condition , not nutrients. All nutrients are inert by decree. So the simple truths that vitamin C cures scurvy or that vitamin D prevents cancer are censored out of existence by the FDA and its media cohorts. So the AP, instead of reporting to the American people what works to make them healthy , spends its time attacking Suzanne Somers over her new book featuring interviews with doctors who have cured cancer using nutritional therapies and other forms of alternative medicine. ( http://www.amazon.com/Knockout-Interviews-Do... ) When it comes to health, the Associated Press apparently isn't interested in reporting what works. It's not interested in educating the public how to be healthy, how to avoid cancer, or how to explore natural therapies that might support their health rather than destroying it (like chemotherapy does). Instead, the AP has taken the side of the criminally-operated pharmaceutical industry to discredit and destroy anything that offers the American people freedom of choice in their medicines. The AP is a powerful, global news manufacturer. Its stories are picked up and republished by thousands of newspapers around the world. Because it is creating 'ready-for-publication' news to be dropped into newspapers and magazines, it is supposed to write objective news , without the level of editorializing that you might expect from blogs or sites like selfnews. AP is supposed to be leave editors' opinions out of the stories and just print the actual news. But instead, AP is now prefacing many of their health stories with this stilted, opinionated and completely inaccurate statement attempting to trash the entire alternative medicine industry. That's not a news service... that's just a highly opinionated smear against the only industry that offers any real solutions for lasting health. Knowing the association's outright bias against natural medicine, now you have to wonder about everything they publish: Are they censoring success stories about natural medicine? Are they collaborating with drug companies to hype up the supposed 'benefits' of pharmaceuticals? Are they twisting stories to try to discredit natural medicine in the minds of readers? I've been watching both the AP and Reuters very carefully for the last several years. I've never seen Reuters pull the kind of stunt AP has just committed. Although Reuters covers conventional medicine, it also covers breakthroughs in natural medicine, so even though I don't agree with everything Reuters says, that news organization at least takes their objectiveness seriously, and they seem to do a good job providing some balanced mainstream coverage of health issues. The AP, though, has lost all credibility on health issues. It's just another Big Pharma mouthpiece, spouting out the same babble we get from FDA cronies and crooked drug company CEOs. It's all the same broken record: Plants don't contain medicine, take your vaccine shot, take your prescription drugs, patented chemical pills will cure you, and so on ad nauseam . So I have a question for the AP editors who are writing their opinions-parading-as-news stories: You say $2.5 billion has been spent on alternative medicine with almost no cures found. Do you have any idea how much money Americans are spending on pharmaceutical medicine every year with absolutely no cures being offered? In 2006, the world spent $643 billion on pharmaceuticals . Where are the cures? There are no pharmaceutical cures for cancer. There are no pharmaceutical cures for heart disease. There are no pharmaceutical cures for diabetes. There are no pharmaceutical cures for kidney disease. There are no pharmaceutical cures for depression. There are no pharmaceutical cures for liver disease. There are no pharmaceutical cures for Alzheimer's disease. ... in fact, if you add it all up, the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest rip-off in the history of medicine! The world spends nearly a trillion dollars a year on pharmaceuticals now, and yet there hasn't been a single cure found by the drug industry for any major disease or health condition. Not a single cure. Where is the cure for cancer? For diabetes? For heart disease? Alternative medicine offers cures for all three. You can cure cancer using the natural medicine described right here on this website. You can reverse diabetes through simple changes in diet and exercise. You can reverse heart disease with nutritional strategies such as shifting to a plant-based diet. Pharmaceuticals can cure none of these things, even after trillions of dollars have been spent trying to 'find cures.' If the Associated Press had any interest at all in printing real news , they might want to report on how the pharmaceutical industry is the greatest medical hoax ever perpetrated in the history of the world. They might be interested in the trillions of dollars being wasted on false hope from dangerous pills that cure nothing. Maybe the AP would want to report on the price fixing, the bribery of doctors, the fraudulent science, the hidden studies showing harm , the fact that 80% of drug ingredients are made in China and India, or any of a hundred other areas of concern about the criminal pharmaceutical industry. But no, the AP chooses to attack Suzanne Somers instead. Instead of reporting actual news that might be important to your health, the AP is manufacturing its own agenda-driven opinion pieces and passing them off as real news. Maybe the Associated Press should change its name to 'The AP Blog.' Sources for this story include: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_...

0," Tweet The House of Representatives will vote this week on a controversial 'national food uniformity' labeling law that will take away local government and states' power to require food safety labels such as those required in California and other states on foods or beverages that are likely to cause cancer, birth defects, allergic reactions, or mercury poisoning. This bill would also prevent citizens in local municipalities and states from passing laws requiring that genetically engineered foods and ingredients such as Monsanto's recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH) be labeled. The House will vote March 2, 2006 on a bill that would gut state food safety and labeling laws. H.R. 4167, the 'National Uniformity for Food Act,' lowers the bar on food safety by overturning state food safety laws that are not 'identical' to federal law. Hundreds of state laws and regulations are at risk, including those governing the safety of milk, fish, and shellfish. The bill is being pushed by large supermarket chains and food manufacturers, spearheaded by the powerful Grocery Manufacturers of America. Big food corporations and the biotech industry understand that consumers are more and more concerned about food safety, genetic engineering, and chemical-intensive agriculture, and are reading labels more closely. They understand that pesticide and mercury residues and hazardous technologies such as genetic engineering and food irradiation will be rejected if there are truthful labels required on food products. Industry-sponsored H.R. 4167 is gaining momentum and must be stopped! Act now! Preserve local and regional democracy and protect yourself and your family from unsafe food by sending an email or calling your Representative and urging them to vote 'No' on H.R. 4167. Please Take Action Now -- Send a Message to Your Congress Member in the House of Representatives to Vote 'No' on H.R. 4167. Visit http://www.organicconsumers.org/rd/labeling.cfm (scroll down to bottom of the page to the form). And please call your Congress Member at 202-224-3121. - Organic Consumers Association Comments from the Health Ranger The tyranny of Washington is at work yet again, this time trying to take away the right of cities and states to require warning labels on food and grocery products containing dangerous, cancer-causing and life-threatening chemicals. Big food companies want to keep the population ignorant of what's really in their food. So they want to make it illegal for states to protect their citizens from dangers that are not recognized by Washington. But Washington, of course, has sold out to lobbyists and wealthy corporations. That's why aspartame, a document nerve toxin, is still legal. That's why sodium nitrite, a potent cancer-causing ingredient, is still widely used. And that's why hydrogenated oils, which promote heart disease and cancer, hasn't been banned by the FDA. If this bill passes, you'll see Frankenfoods (genetically-modified foods), irradiated foods, and foods containing mercury and other poisons sold in grocery stores with no warning labels whatsoever. That's how big food companies like it: Keep the public ignorant! That's why they're lobbying hard for this 'de-labeling' bill. But now, you can help stop the tyrants in Washington. Call your Congress Member at 202-224-3121 and urge them to vote NO on H.R. 4167. Timing is urgent: You must do this before March 1st. Spread the word. If we don't stop this bill now, the grocery manufacturers will get their way and WE, the consumers, will be harmed by it. If you live in the U.S., take back your power today by making a call, or otherwise contacting your Congressional representative. This is how bad laws get stopped. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Anxiety manifests itself differently in people, but symptoms may include a lack of energy, mental confusion, dizziness, fears or irritability. Eating the correct foods and taking certain supplements have aided many sufferers to combat anxiety attacks. A diet high in refined sugars may contribute to anxious feelings or mood swings. Some studies indicate that anxiety sufferers derive up to 75 percent of their calories from refined carbohydrates and sugars. There may also be a history of liver disorders, mal-absorption of food and/or fluctuating blood sugar levels. One approach in treating anxiety is to increase or improve liver function with the correct diet, usually one that is low in sugar and free from junk food and refined carbohydrates. Tea, coffee and alcohol are eliminated because they can jeopardize optimal liver function. Calcium rich foods are sometimes recommended in the prevention of anxiety attacks. Foods naturally high in calcium include almonds, Brazil nuts, broccoli, oysters, salmon, sardines, sesame seeds, dark green leafy vegetables, raw milk, egg yolks and molasses. In the case of fluctuating blood sugar levels, foods high in vitamin B5 are usually recommended. Foods high in vitamin B5 are avocados, bean sprouts, eggs, free range beef, lentils, mushrooms, mackerel, watermelons and pineapples. Mineral salts that alleviate anxiety Tissue salts are the minerals which should be present in the human body in perfect balance. Tissue salts are readily available and safe to take. However, vitamins and mineral supplements should always be tailored to an individual's needs. Therefore, a visit to a qualified naturopathic practitioner or homeopath is always recommended. Kali. Phos. (tissue salt no. 6) is one of the most important tissue salts for the mental symptoms of worry, distress or dread. Two tablets dissolved under the tongue every half hour will lift and lighten the mood . Those who exhibit reclusive traits or who avoid being part of any demanding situation will greatly benefit from this mineral. Mag. Phos. (tissue salt no. 8) helps in cases of unreasonable moods or outbursts. Mag. Phos will also help restless sleepers and those who are prone to night terrors and fears. Nat. Sulph. (tissue salt no. 11) can counter feelings of anxiety , depression and discouragement. Two tablets of Nat. Sulph. taken four to six times a day can help to relieve these symptoms. It also helps those experiencing anxiety-ridden feelings of being overly burdened with life's problems. Nat. Mur. (tissue salt no. 9) helps with feelings of despair or gloom. Taken regularly, it will help balance those who live on a 'short fuse', making them less aggressive and impatient.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Any news item that links apples with good health always brings to mind the old adage 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away'. But new research is showing not only is that statement true, but apples might specifically keep a particular kind of doctor away an oncologist. Dr. Rui Hai Liu, Cornell associate professor of food science, has identified a dozen compounds dubbed triterpenoids in apple peel that either inhibit or kill cancer cells in the lab. Three of these triterpenoids have never been reported before, according to Dr. Liu, whose research was just published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry . He describes them as having potent anti-proliferative activities against human liver, colon and breast cancer cells. In earlier Cornell studies, apples were found to reduce the number and shrink the size of breast tumor cells in rats. Dr. Liu has also previously identified compounds called phytochemicals in apples and other foods that appear to have anti-cancer properties, including inhibiting human breast cancer cells tumor growth. Dr. Liu's research team took the peels from 230 pounds of red delicious apples and analyzed the individual compounds they found. Then the researchers tested many of the pure compounds against cancer cell growth in the laboratory. 'We believe that a recommendation that consumers eat five to 12 servings of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables daily is appropriate to reduce the risks of chronic diseases, including cancer , and to meet nutrient requirements for optimum health,' Dr. Liu stated. In more research published in the International Journal of Cancer (March 19, 2008), scientists in the department of nutritional toxicology at Freidrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany, offer evidence apples may help fight human colon cancer. The researchers investigated whether polyphenols found in apples had an impact on genes related to colon cancer. The result? Apple extracts appear to protect precancerous cells from toxicological insults disrupting their transformation into cancer. Apples have already been shown to be rich a soluble fiber, pectin, which successfully lowers cholesterol by targeting the 'bad' stuff LDL. Eating just two apples daily has caused cholesterol levels in test subject humans to plummet by up to 16 percent. Pectin has also received raves from researchers who found it helps diabetics regulate blood sugar, preventing a sudden spike or drop in blood sugar levels. What's more, flavonoids, a type of pigment in apples that helps give their peels color, have been extensively researched and found to fight heart disease. For example, researchers in Finland studied over 5,000 Finish men and women for over 20 years. The results? The people who ate the most apples and other flavonoid-rich foods like tea and onion (such as onions and tea), had a 20% lower risk of heart disease than those who ate the least of these foods. More good news for fruit lovers who can't always get the fresh variety: fruits retain their powerful health-promoting powers even when frozen, according to a new study just published in the Journal of Medicinal Food . Scientists from the Instituto de Biotecnologia at the University of Caxias do Sul in Brazil have identified antioxidant and antimutagenic activity in frozen fruits. Natural cancer-fighting substances including polyphenols, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid were found in significant levels in fruits, despite being frozen. These data, the researchers concluded, suggest that eating frozen fruits can contribute to the prevention of biological damages that may precede cancer and other diseases.

0," He was widely panned for it, but former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who recently joined the crowded field of Republican presidential contenders, became the first and so far, only member of that group that has tied the recent Charleston, S.C., shootings to Big Pharma. In an appearance on NewsmaxTV's Steve Malzberg Show , Perry made the claim that the killing of nine African American worshippers by avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof was caused by mind-altering drugs. In response to a question by Malzberg regarding whether he thought the shootings were an act of terrorism, Perry noted, 'I don't know, but I think the facts, once we get them there were more people than that killed in Paris,' he said, a reference to the attacks by Islamic terrorists on the offices of satire magazine Charlie Hebdo . 'This was a crime of hate we know that.' 'The VA is handing out these opioids' Perry continued: 'It seems to me, again without having all the details about this, that these individuals have been medicated and there may be a real issue in this country from the standpoint of these drugs and how they're used.' He went on to point out that mood-and-mind-altering psychotropic drugs have been at the center of virtually all mass shootings in the U.S. since the Columbine school shootings in the late 1990s (see our report on this here ). Perry also noted that 'the Veterans Administration, for instance, is handing out these opioids in massive amounts. And then people question: 'Well, why can't these young individuals get work?' Or, 'Why is the suicide rate so high?'' (We have also covered this issue; see one of our reports here ). During the interview, Perry also lashed out at President Barack Obama for politicizing the killings. 'This is the [modus operandi] of this administration, any time there is an accident like this,' Perry said. 'The president is clear, he doesn't like for Americans to have guns and so he uses every opportunity, this being another one, to basically go parrot that message. 'So, I mean, there are a lot of issues here underlying this that I think we as a country need to have a conversation about,' Perry concluded, 'rather than just the knee-jerk reaction of saying, you know, if we can just take all the guns away this won't happen,' he said. He went on to say as well that he was not advocating any specific policy change in reaction to the shootings, but he was adamant about the drug connection, as others have been. Mass shootings and drugs Perry, we should also note, may be sounding a little duplicitous on this issue. You may recall that, in February 2007 , while still governor of Texas, 'issued an executive order that bypassed the will of the Texas people and the entire legislature, mandating the vaccination of young girls -- in Grade 6 in Texas -- with the HPV vaccine Gardasil,' as Christina Luisa reported in 2011. 'Merck, the pharmaceutical company in charge of the villainous venture and the chief distributor of the vaccine, was the same drug company that was reported to have given thousands of dollars to Perry's campaign efforts,' Luisa wrote at the time for selfnews . Still, the connection between Big Pharma psychotropic medications and mass shootings cannot be denied or ignored. In the case of the Charleston killings, the suspect Dylann Roof was arrested a few months before carrying non-prescribed suboxone, a medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence such as heroin addiction.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Enzymes are molecules that act as catalysts for all chemical reactions within the body and are necessary to sustain life. There are two basic categories: digestive enzymes which work in the stomach breaking down food particles before their nutrients can be absorbed, and metabolic (or systemic) enzymes whose primary work begins in the bloodstream digesting foreign debris before traveling to bodily tissues to continue this and other functions. A chronic deficiency of enzymes weakens the immune system, contributes to illness, and ultimately promotes diseases such as cancer. Both enzyme types are produced in the body but are also present in raw foods and through oral supplementation. To achieve and maintain optimum health, an adequate supply of both forms is fundamental. There are twenty-two different types of enzymes produced in the body, primarily by the pancreas, and this production diminishes as we age (1). The three basic digestive enzymes are amylase, lipase, and protease which breakdown carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Additionally, cellulose and lactose break down fiber and dairy. These enzymes work in the stomach during the period of pre-digestion; however, when food is cooked or processed its naturally occurring enzymes are destroyed. Consuming denatured food overburdens the body as it taps into its ever-decreasing enzyme supply in an effort to complete the pre-digestion process. When insufficient pre-digestion occurs, the body produces an excess amount of stomach acid trying to offset the imbalance. This contributes to acid reflux, heartburn, gas, bloating, and malnutrition (even in overweight individuals) due to incomplete digestion. Partially digested proteins putrefy in the intestines forming toxic substances. Once these toxins enter the bloodstream, they weaken the immune system and contribute to many serious health conditions as they accumulate in tissues throughout the body. Consuming raw food, reducing the amount of cooked and processed foods as much as possible, chewing food thoroughly to activate enzymes in saliva, plus regular supplementation of digestive enzymes with meals will help offset the ill effects of an enzyme deficiency. Enzyme-rich food ensures its complete digestion and leaves the body's supplies available for other processes. Complimenting the work of digestive enzymes are metabolic enzymes which facilitate virtually every chemical reaction and cellular function of the body , including cleansing the blood and reducing inflammation throughout the body, among many other vital bodily processes. A deficiency results when metabolic enzymes are diverted for digestion requirements. A weakened immune system due to an unmet enzyme deficiency allows for the accumulation of pathogens (disease causing agents) and carcinogens ( cancer causing substances), and the body's inability to suppress or contain the growth of cancerous cells. Nearly all pathogens, including cancer cells, are protected by a protein-based coating, or 'fibrin', that makes it difficult for the immune system to identify and destroy them. This sticky coating can be up to 15 times thicker than the membrane of normal cells (1,5). This is where metabolic enzymes are needed. The bulk of these enzymes are proteases, or 'protealytic', which means they speed up the breakdown of proteins. In sufficient quantities, they digest the protective fibrin membrane and expose the cancer cells to the immune system. Since the pancreas produces most of the body's enzyme supplies, supplementing with metabolic enzymes assists this often-overworked organ and helps stave off cancer. An ample supply of pancreatic enzymes should be taken orally between meals to ease the body's metabolic burden and conserve its enzyme supplies. Unlike digestive enzymes which are taken with food, metabolic enzymes are taken on an empty stomach to facilitate their entry into the bloodstream. Due to their protein-digesting capabilities and health-enhancing properties, therapeutic doses of metabolic/pancreatic enzymes have been successfully used for decades to help treat cancer. Historically, the case for pancreatic enzymes in cancer therapy was first established in the early 1900s by the Scottish Embryologist John Beard, who observed under the microscope that placenta cells resemble malignant cells as they grow in preparation for the creation of a baby. Observing that the placental tissue stops growing at eight weeks once the fetus' pancreatic enzyme production begins, Beard theorized that a malignant tumor mass would respond likewise provided a sufficient quantity of pancreatic enzymes was supplied (2,3). Beard tested his theories with great success using pancreatic juices to reduce tumors in humans and animals, and these findings were published in his 1911 monograph entitled The Enzyme Therapy of Cancer. His pioneering work was all but forgotten following his death in 1923 until a Texas dentist by the name of William Donald Kelley established a similar theory based on Beard's work nearly forty years later (2,3). Kelley cured himself of advanced pancreatic cancer using a protocol largely reliant on nutrition and mega doses of pancreatic enzyme supplementation. He went on to successfully treat thousands of other 'terminal' cancer patients; but despite his extraordinary achievements, he was ostracized by the medical community who refused (and still refuses) to accept that natural, non-toxic substances are effective treatments against cancer. New York City cancer specialist Nicholas Gonzalez, MD began a case review of Kelley's patients beginning in 1981 while still a med student at Cornell University. This included research into oral pancreatic enzymes for cancer treatment, and eventually led to his own practice utilizing the enzyme approach with advanced cancer patients. He continues to treat his patients with natural therapies and enzymes based on the work of Beard and Kelley (4). Healthy individuals can take small doses of both digestive enzymes with meals and metabolic enzymes on an empty stomach in order to maintain health and prevent a deficiency over time. Pregnant women should always consult a health care provider before beginning a regime of supplementation. For people with serious health challenges it may be best to begin oral enzyme supplementation with small doses, gradually increasing until maximum benefits are felt. Supplementing between meals with as many as 40-60 systemic enzymes as a daily therapeutic dose for cancer patients is not uncommon (3,4,5). A natural health care practitioner can assist in deciding the proper supplement type and dosage. References: 1. Diamond, M.D., W.John, and Cowden, M.D., W.Lee: Cancer Diagnosis, What To Do Next.

0," Today I'm publishing the laboratory test results that document the levels of lead, cadmium, arsenic and aluminum found in popular cigarettes and cigarette rolling paper. The good news is that the concentrations of metals are very low in the rolling paper. Below, a series of graphics show the cigarette heavy metals lab testing results as well as microscopy photos of cigarette materials and cigarette filters. (I conducted the ICP-MS research and took the microscopy photos myself.) BACKGROUND: As selfnews readers know, I'm the science lab director of the selfnews Forensic Food Lab , where we run an Agilent 7700x ICP-MS instrument capable of detecting heavy metals down to parts per billion concentrations. I was the first researcher in the world to document the heavy metals capturing potential of common foods , and the first to document the heavy metal tungsten in rice protein products . I am the developer and patent holder of Cesium Eliminator , a dietary supplement that binds with radioactive isotopes, and Heavy Metals Defense , a dietary supplement that binds with toxic heavy metals during digestion. I am also the creator of the Low Heavy Metals Verified standard that we use to validate the cleanliness of all the products sold at the selfnews Store The selfnews Forensic Food Lab operates under ISO 17025 quality rules, with international accreditation pending. Over the last year or so, I've used the instrument to test protein powders, nutritional supplements, medicinal herbs, fast food and much more. But now, we're putting this technology to a different use and testing cigarettes, tattoo ink, skin whiteners, cosmetics and other consumable products to determine their heavy metal concentrations. Heavy metals lab test results for American Spirit, Marlboro, Pall Mall, Camel and Winston cigarettes The big story here is that there is significant lead in all the cigarettes we tested . In fact, there's more lead in cigarettes than the lead we found in most brands of rice protein in our widely-publicized research from last year . This is especially concerning because cigarette smoke is inhaled into the lungs, providing a direct pathway into the bloodstream. Our tests focused on the heavy metals concentrations of the tobacco leaf in each cigarette. We were not able to account for the ability of cigarette filters to remove toxic heavy metals from the inhalation stream, but it is logical and reasonable to assume that cigarette filters may remove some portion of heavy metals from the inhaled smoke . We are actively looking for a way to test the concentration of heavy metals removed by filtration vs. those that are inhaled by the smoker.

0," A recent NY Times (NYT) article covered the trend of more and more hospitals no longer giving out free samples of infant formulas to birthing mothers provided by the manufacturers. The article cited expert consensus for the benefits of breast feeding and the infant formula manufacturers' understanding that breast feeding is 'the gold standard.' But it also focused considerably on the mothers who protest the ban. Considerable commentary both in the article and in the comments displayed the pro and con sides of this issue. The con-side declared some mothers cannot breast feed, and formula is expensive. They weren't reminded how inexpensive breast feeding is. But the pro side points out that when a hospital provides free samples of infant formula, it makes it appear that there is no difference in how someone feeds an infant. And it also makes it seem there is no support for overcoming actual breast feeding difficulties. Here's one example of support from this pediatric guide for breast feeding issues. ( http://pediatrics.about.com ) Granting longer periods of paid maternity leave would be helpful. The US.. ranks lowest among industrialized nations for paid maternity leaves, which emphasize the mother's recovery more than giving her space and time to breast feed for at least six months. Comparing infant formula with mothers' breast milk One weakness displayed both in the NYT article and its comments was the lack of nutritional awareness. Soy-based infant formulas were often referred to as a good solution. But the fact is that soy , even non-GMO soy, has problems. And most soy is GM. The only soy that's beneficial is fermented, organic soy, such as that which comprises natto, tempeh, misso, and some soy sauces. Soy as a health food is a con. Even non-GMO soy, which is very rare, has several anti-nutrients that block or impede the body's ability to absorb nutrients. Soy products dampen thyroid activity, promote excessive blood clotting, contain phytoestrogens that create hormone imbalances, and carry toxic levels of aluminum and manganese. Soy crops, especially GMOs, are very heavily sprayed with toxic chemicals. Even non-soy milk infant formulas contain some soy products. Infant formulas contain massive amounts of sugar that may be GMO (beet sugar) and even worse, GMO corn syrup compounds or HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). Unlike sugar, corn syrup or HFCS is not fully metabolized into energy. Almost half of it is stored in the liver as fat. Mike Adams jumps all over what Similac contains after analyzing the label. Similac had to be recalled around that time because beetle larvae was found in some of their formula products. But Mike asserts the bugs are not the issue; the formula itself amounts to 'nutritional child abuse.' ( http://www.selfnews.com/029863_Similac_infant_formula.html ) Water needs to be added to instant formula powders. Unless a family resides in a non-fluoridated water supply area, they'll be poisoning their children further without using reverse osmosis filtered water. The child's IQ will be lower in addition to suffering some brain damage and other health consequences. ( http://www.selfnews.com/032129_fluoridation_intelligence.html ) One solution is for the mothers who find it impossible to breast feed to purchase infant formulas with added prebiotics and probiotics, which can also be added to standard infant formulas ( http://www.selfnews.com ) Goat's milk colostrum powder may be a way to replace the mother's milk colostrum that's missing from infant formulas. Goat's milk resembles human mother's milk more than cow's milk. Colostrum protects the infant's fragile immune system. Lactoferrin supplements can also be added. Even pediatricians agree that breast feeding for at least the first six months is vital for you child's overall future health. Just say no to pediatric pushiness on vaccinating your children.

0," Don't believe what conventional medicine tells you about aging, degenerative disease and premature death. You can live a more productive, healthier and happier life - for many more years than your doctor believes and it has little to do with your genetics. In fact, proper diet and lifestyle choices can quickly turn your life around. Want to prevent years of pain and suffering? Learn how to prevent oxidative damage; cellular inflammation; unwanted glycation and chronic stress.

According to Jonny Bowden, Ph.D, CNS - 'free radicals are like an obnoxious drunk single guy at your high school reunion who keeps trying to pick up your wife.' (women just reverse the image!) In simple biochemical terms, this single electron (free radical) is trying to find a partner (another electron) and, in the process, creates lots of cellular damage. If you want to avoid oxidative damage - be sure to eat plenty of antioxidant rich foods. Keep in mind, these unwanted (chaotic) free radicals will attack cells and damage your DNA. This process of oxidative stress will eventually cause chronic fatigue, metabolic disorders, organ failure and premature death. Sadly, uneducated people never learn that oxidative stress is completely avoidable through proper diet and lifestyle modifications. What exactly is 'glycation' and how does it harm our health? When you eat too much sugar - these sugar molecules tend to attach themselves to healthy, slippery proteins and we call this 'glycation'. Diabetics are a perfect example of how excess sugar, in the blood supply, can cause premature aging and death. One of the best ways to avoid glycation is to minimize your consumption of overcooked foods and processed sugars. To avoid glycation - be sure to consume lots of antioxidants like vitamin C and carnosine. Dr. Bowen recommends '1,000 mg of carnosine to your daily anti-aging regime.' Remember, we don't tend to naturally store enough carnosine - so supplementation is a good idea. To avoid premature aging and disease - lower your exposure to free radicals; eliminate cellular inflammation; avoid glycation and reduce stress in your life - as quickly as possible.

0," Walnuts are the large, single-seeded fruits of the walnut tree. Though different species of walnut exist, the English walnut, which originated in Persia, remains the most popular species. In fact, virtually all of today's commercially-produced walnuts are either English walnuts or hybrids thereof. Other species of walnut, such as the black walnut, are seldom cultivated due to their comparatively tough shells and poor hulling qualities. Walnuts are highly nutritious, and their health benefits have been well-known in China and India for centuries. They are just as revered in the West, however, and a large number of studies confirm the allegations of the ancient healing systems. Packed with brain-boosting fats Walnuts are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, particularly the plant-based omega-3 fat, alpha-linolenic acid. These beneficial fats, which are the same fats that comprise our brains and nervous systems, give walnuts considerable brain-boosting properties. For example, a study published in Plant Foods for Human Nutrition in November 2011 discovered that rats that were fed walnuts for 28 days demonstrated a 'significant improvement in learning and memory' compared to the control group. A second study, published two years later in Nutritional Neuroscience , showed that the fatty acids in walnut extracts could prevent age-related inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain's hippocampal cells. Studies have also linked the regular consumption of walnuts to numerous other brain-related benefits, including the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and improved inferential reasoning, concentration spans and interneuronal signaling. Just like coconut oil, another food that boosts cognitive function, almost all of these benefits stem from walnuts' high concentrations of beneficial fats. Cancer prevention According to a study published in The Journal of Nutrition in April 2014, mice that were implanted with human breast cancers and fed a walnut-based diet experienced a gigantic 80 percent decrease in tumor growth rate compared to the control group. The study also found that walnuts slowed the growth of colon, prostate and renal cancers in mice, with whole walnuts providing the biggest benefits. The researchers attributed these results to certain antioxidant compounds in walnuts, such as tocopherols, beta-sitosterol and pedunculagin, which possess anti-cancer properties. Strengthen the cardiovascular system Foods rich in beneficial fats are known to improve our cardiovascular systems, and walnuts are no exception. A recent study published in The Journal of Nutrition , for instance, discovered that walnuts have been shown to decrease 'bad' LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Consequently, the researchers recommend that people add more walnuts to their diets to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence also suggests that walnuts can boost endothelial function, making them a viable treatment for type II diabetes. Good source of additional nutrients Though walnuts' rich supplies of good fats will always be their biggest draw, we shouldn't overlook their surprisingly high concentrations of nutrients, which include calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and most B vitamins. Walnuts are especially high in magnesium, an essential macromineral in which an estimated 50 to 80 percent of the United States population are deficient. Like most nuts , walnuts are also a good source of protein, though the protein is incomplete (i.e. it doesn't contain all eight essential amino acids). Walnuts are best eaten raw and whole. While a lot of people dislike their bitter skins, these skins contain up to 90 percent of the fruit's main cancer-fighting antioxidants, so ensure that they're eaten too. "
0," A recent Danish study observed that several other studies have recorded evidence of vitamin C deficiency as a high risk factor for heart disease. This study's conclusion was to merely propose a protocol for further study, ensuring the randomized double-blind approach for 'science based evidence.' This study's proposal was recorded by PubMed in March, 2013 as 'Does vitamin C deficiency increase lifestyle-associated vascular disease progression? - Evidence based on experimental and clinical studies.' (1-1a) This has already been worked out by orthomolecular and holistic health practitioners for well over a half century. But orthomolecular (mega-dose nutritional supplementation) is a bastard child of mainstream medicine. It is ignored even though most of the practitioners are certified MDs. A synopsis of ascorbic acid C for heart health Most of the vitamin C research for therapeutic purposes has been with ascorbic acid, which now more than ever is vilified as a synthetic toxin. Later in this article, some foods high in vitamin C will be listed. For now , consider that the Vitamin C Foundation the The Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine , and OrthoMed.org all firmly disagree. Why they disagree is explained point by point in a pdf. (2) Their disagreement is not theoretical or speculative. There have been several thousand cures of polio, cancer, and other diseases using mega-dose ascorbic acid. There is a history of successful ascorbic acid treatments curing the incurable, all ignored by the medical mafia. (3) Hundreds of comatose patients were led from death's door dramatically when mega-dose IV vitamin C or oral liposomal vitamin C were introduced. They used pharmaceutical grade ascorbic acid. Here's one very dramatic example featured by New Zealand's 60 Minutes TV News ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrhkoFcOMII ). Liposomal C is the new kid on the block. It can be taken orally and requires less ascorbic acid because it directs 90 percent of the vitamin C into cells instead of IV C's 20 percent cellular saturation ( http://www.selfnews.com/034591_vitamin_C_mega-dose_healing.html ). Pharmaceutical grade ascorbic acid is available online as a Vitamin C Foundation endorsed China-free, GMO-free ascorbic acid from Europe. It's pricier than the corn based stuff from China, and it's not used in most supplements that contain vitamin C as ascorbic acid because it's not cheap enough. Toronto physician William McCormick, MD, had investigated heart disease's relationship to vitamin C deficiency 20 years before two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling started his heart health research. Dr. McCormick's research led to the current IV mega-dose vitamin C applications of up to 100 grams daily for several diseases, including cancer. (3) During the 1980s, Linus Pauling tested high doses of ascorbic acid with the affordable amino acid lysine to reverse atherosclerosis (clogged arteries). This joint effort removes plaque and boosts collagen to restore the interior vessel walls endothelium's (thin skin layer) strength and elasticity. (4) Food sources for vitamin C Unlike most other mammals, humans don't create their own vitamin C. So it must be constantly taken in to avoid deficiency. Linus Pauling recommended using as many food sources as possible to obtain vitamin C with complete nutritive co-factors. Here are some choices: (5) Lemon or lime warm unsweetened water first thing in the morning Citrus fruits, try to include the pulp and some of the white stuff under the fruit's skin ( http://www.selfnews.com ). Potatoes, eat the skin Berries, any kind, fresh and organic Green veggies of all types, raw or lightly steamed Tomatoes and tomato sauces Spinach, raw in salad Melons of all types Vitamin C's fame has been recently eclipsed by other supplements, but its importance remains the same.

0," Adaptogenic herbs have beneficial stress adapting properties that they pass on to those who consume them to support healthy function. Astragalus is an herb that has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years to assist the body in adapting to stress and boosting natural immunity. Astragalus belongs to the legume family of herbs and small shrubs and is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has been called milkvetch, locoweed and goat's thorn. There are more than 2000 species worldwide, but the varieties that are most revered are found in Central and Western Asia due to the presence of certain bacteria in the soil that are required for its growth. Active compounds in astragalus The active compounds in astragalus root include polysaccharide cycloartane glycoside fractions, isoflavonoids, saponins and triterpenoids. All of these have a powerful effect on the balancing stress and stimulating immunity. Polyscaccharides are specific carbohydrates that provide powerful antioxidant effects in the body and feed the immune cells. Since these polysaccharides feed the body, astragalus enhances the body's overall vitality and is extremely helpful for individuals with chronic illnesses. It fights fatigue by nourishing exhausted adrenals, eliminating toxins in the liver and increasing the flow of bile and digestive fluids. Astragalus also contains betaine, beta-sitosterol, calcium, choline, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, zinc, flavonoids, saponins and triterpenoid glycosides. The triterpenoids and saponins have a similar structural makeup to steroid hormone precursors such as DHEA. This may be why astragalus helps elevate DHEA levels and helps us recover from physical activity and improve strength and endurance. Astragalus and the immune system: Astragalus is one of the most researched immune system stimulants. It concentrates on building immunity and can be taken daily to strengthen the immune system and prevent infection. It works by stimulating the body's production of antiviral compounds called interferons and restoring red blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Due to its beneficial affects on the Th1 arm of the immune system, it is used to treat HIV viral infections, pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmia. It also has shown great promise for individuals with cancer. In a University of Texas Medical Center study, researchers found that astragalus significantly enhanced T cell function in cancer patients. In some of the cases, astragalus was shown to stimulate the damaged cells to greater activity than normal cells taken from healthy individuals. Studies done by the American Cancer Society have even showed that cancer patients taking astragalus while receiving radiation and chemotherapy recovered significantly faster and lived longer. Significant increases in white blood cells were found after only two weeks of use of this herb. It was shown not to attack cancer cells but to strengthen the body's innate immune defenses against cancer development. Other studies have demonstrated that Astragalus is effective at helping the body's immune system respond to viral invasions, such as the common cold and flu. It is also great at strengthening the adrenals, improving metabolism, energy, mental stamina and blood sugar control. Astragalus boosts Th1 immunity: Astragalus is particularly effective against Th2 dominant conditions such as asthma, allergies, cancer, lupus, scleroderma, sinusitis, eczema, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity. Astragalus boosts the Th1 system and helps balance out the immune system with these sort of disorders. If an individual has a classical Th1 dominant condition, such as type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Hashimoto's, Grave's Disease, Crohn's, Psoriasis, Sjoren's Syndrome, Celiac, lichen planus and rheumatoid arthritits, they should restrict their use of astragalus. In these circumstances, astragalus can cause further immune imbalance and resulting autoimmune inflammatory conditions. "
0," We weren't planning to cover this story until the Associated Press confirmed that Aaron Alexis, the shooter believed responsible for the recent mass shooting at the Navy yard, 'had been treated since August by the Veterans Administration for his mental problems.' This is proof that Aaron Alexis was on psychiatric drugs, because that's the only treatment currently being offered by the Veterans Administration for mental problems. Alexis' family members also confirmed to the press that he was being 'treated' for his mental health problems. Across the medical industry, 'treatment' is the code word for psychiatric drugging. Nearly every shooter has a history of psychiatric drug use As selfnews readers well know, the vast majority of mass shooters in U.S. history have all been on mind-altering psychiatric drugs. Those prescription medications create feelings of detachment in people, making them feel like they 'playing out a video game' rather than acting out in the real world. See a list of some of the other shootings where the perpetrators were taking psychiatric drugs in this selfnews article . Not coincidentally, Aaron Alexis was also 'obsessed with violent video games,' reports The Telegraph . Violent video games allow potential shooters to 'rehearse' their first-person murderous rampage actions, reinforcing the actions in their brain neurology. It makes the act of killing seem normal, if not habitual. This combination is repeated over and over again in violent mass killings: psychiatric drugs + video games = mass death . Press once again lies about the AR-15 Of course, a mass shooting also needs to have a firearm present, but even facts surrounding those claims are now proven to be widely and inaccurately reported by the mainstream media -- an institution which has now utterly abandoned the concept of fact checking in its rush to get the story out. Not only has the media had to retract its initial claim of the identity of the shooter, it also turns out that there was no AR-15 used in the shooting at all . 'Federal law enforcement sources told CNN Tuesday that authorities have recovered three weapons from the scene of the mass shooting, including one -- a shotgun -- that investigators believe Alexis brought in to the compound,' reports CNN . 'The other two weapons, which sources say were handguns, may have been taken from guards at the Navy complex. The sources, who have detailed knowledge of the investigation, cautioned that initial information that an AR-15 was used in the shootings may have been incorrect. It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday morning's shootings.' Regardless of the shooter's weapon of choice, it also turns out that once again he chose a 'gun-free zone' to carry out his crime , knowing full well that no ordinary citizens would be able to return fire, giving him plenty of time to carry out his mad killing plan. This is another characteristic of recent mass shootings : they have all taken place in gun-free zones . Such zones are obviously the preferred targets of mass killers who seek to minimize their own risk of being taken out by return fire. Finally, it is worth noting that the SWAT team which eventually shot and killed Aaron Alexis most likely did so with an AR-15 rifle, proving that AR-15s are extremely useful in protecting the public when deployed in the hands of someone who has the best interests of the public in mind. The actual rifle model used to kill Alexis has not yet been released, so it could have been something else, but there is no question that SWAT team members were well armed with AR-15-style tactical rifles and that such rifles in the hands of those men unquestionably served a positive role of protecting the public. You can't trust the media to tell you the real story The bottom line in all this is that when it comes to shooters, psychiatric drugs and firearms, you simply can't trust the mainstream media to tell you the real story. They will often report half-truths or even just invent bizarre new 'facts' they want you to believe, but they have no real investment in the idea of getting to the actual story of what happened and bringing that story to the public. The media is mostly just using this shooting as another way to sell more advertising while pushing a particular political agenda that utterly ignores the far more dangerous chemical holocaust taking place in our nation due to the widespread deployment of psychiatric drugs. In fact, I am the author of the widely-shared article from 2012 entitled, Gun control? We need medication control! And I stand by that argument today. A firearm in the hands of a competent, ethical person who protects innocent bystanders is a blessing. But a mind-altering medication in the hands of a violent video game addict with extreme anger issues is a catastrophe waiting to happen. "
0," There is a long and fascinating history of relationships between nutritional deficiencies and chronic disease. One of the most well known is probably scurvy -- a disease where your bones lose their rigidity due to a deficiency in vitamin C. The historical accounts of this condition mostly involve sailors who, when long sailing voyages, were overcome by this nutritional deficiency. And it actually took hundreds of years before the right scientist came along and discovered that this was caused by a simple nutritional deficiency that could be cured by eating fruits high in vitamin C such as limes. Hence the name 'limeys' for sailors. That's just one example of a disease caused by nutritional deficiencies. There are many other diseases such as rickets and beriberi that are also caused by nutritional deficiencies. Asian people who historically ate polished, processed rice (white rice) frequently got beriberi, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamin). Until the nutritional causes of beriberi were established, however, physicians of ancient Asia thought the disease was some sort of plague. In America, the term 'redneck' actually comes from a vitamin B deficiency that causes heightened susceptibility to sunburns. Interestingly, most Americans are, today, deficient in B vitamins as well, which is why they are so easily susceptible to sunburns. As explained in Staying Healthy With Nutrition by Dr. Elson Haas, M.D.: For a long period of history, the niacin deficiency disease, pellagra, was a very serious and fatal problem. Characterized as the disease of the 'three Ds,' pellagra causes its victims to experience dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The fourth D was death. As described previously, the classic B3 deficiency occurs mainly in cultures whose diets rely heavily on corn and where the corn is not prepared in a way that releases its niacin. One of the first signs of pellagra, or niacin deficiency, is the skin's sensitivity to light, and the skin becomes rough, thick, and dry (pellagra means 'skin that is rough' in Italian). The skin then becomes darkly pigmented, especially in areas of the body prone to be hot and sweaty or those exposed to sun. The first stage of this condition is extreme redness and sensitivity of those exposed areas, and it was from this symptom that the term 'redneck,' describing the bright red necks of eighteenth-and nineteenth-century niacin-deficient fieldworkers, came into being. Colonial Americans Rejected the Wisdom of American Indians The early colonial settlers in America, by the way, didn't know how to properly process corn as the American Indians did. The American Indians processed corn using potash (which is highly alkaline) that makes the B vitamins in corn available for assimilation during digestion. But the American settlers, not understanding how to prepare corn (and too arrogant to follow the food preparation ways of the Indian 'savages'), would simply grind up their corn and consume it as corn flour (corn meal). By the way, that's how most people eat corn today: as ground up cornmeal ingredients in chips and foods. It's no wonder so many modern Americans remain so deficient in B vitamins. In more modern times, we know very well about what happens when you're deficient in folic acid and you are a pregnant woman: your baby may be born with serious spinal cord defects or even be stillborn. In fact, birth defects are almost always explained by nutritional deficiencies or the consumption of foods and beverages by the mother that interfere with good nutrition. Yet modern (arrogant) medicine remains nutritionally illiterate, refusing to teach expectant mothers much at all about prenatal nutrition (beyond folic acid, anyway). We also know that iodine is absolutely essential for human health, which is why salt is enriched with iodine. That's in an effort to prevent goiter, a disease that was quite common in the United States until iodine was finally mandated as a salt supplement (enrichment) by the FDA. And yet most Americans get only the minimal amount of iodine necessary to prevent disease, not the higher intakes that would enhance health and help prevent obesity and cancer! (Read books by Dr. David Brownstein to learn more about Iodine. See www.DrBrownstein.com ) As a nation we have managed to force a handful of minerals and vitamins into the food supply that prevent only the most grotesque and physically obvious disorders and diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies . And by the way, those are the only ones that really get addressed through the food supply. We have not yet, however, come to our senses enough to actually recommend levels of nutrients that would prevent degenerative diseases like cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's. And that, frankly, is why the public is still not being taught the correlation between nutrition and chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis and even mental disorders like clinical depression. It is why, for example, the truth that Vitamin D, all by itself, prevents nearly four out of five cancers is still not taught to the public (and is, in fact, censored by the cancer industry, which steadfastly remains invested in the business of keeping cancer alive and well in America today). What history has really taught us is that Western medicine is a system run by illiterates who, after hundreds of years of claiming medical superiority, still have not admitted that a single nutrient can treat a single disease. Astonishingly, it remains the regulatory view of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no nutrient has any therapeutic effect whatsoever on human health . If it did, it would be classified a drug, not a nutrient, and would therefore be outlawed as an 'unapproved drug.' Facts are stubborn things, but the blindness of Western medicine has proven itself to be far more stubborn in its pursuit of enforced nutritional illiteracy among not just the population, but the entire medical profession as well. Illiteracy among the uneducated is a dangerous thing, but when selective illiteracy is embraced by those in the position of apparent authority, it becomes a dangerous disservice to humanity. "
0," Thousands of selfnews visitors watched live footage of TalkNetwork.com hosts Pete Santilli and Deb Jordan as they streamed coverage of a Jan. 2 rally in Burns, Oregon, in support of ranchers Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46 . For those who are unfamiliar with their case, the Hammonds were convicted in 2012 under a federal anti-terrorism statute, of committing arson on federal land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. Both were charged in connection with a 2001 fire, and Steven in connection with another fire in 2006. The Hammonds had set backfires a common technique used in rural ranching communities to refresh the soil and clear away dangerous foliage some of which burned federal land adjacent to the land they leased from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). A federal court found them guilty of willful destruction and actually charged them with a violation of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which calls for a minimum sentence of five years in prison. When they were initially convicted, U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan now retired gave them lighter sentences because he did not believe they had exhibited malicious intent. What if they were Middle Eastern and Muslim? Federal prosecutors appealed Hogan's three-month sentence for Dwight Hammond, and one-year sentence for Steven Hammond which both had served because they were far short of the minimum. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and ordered them re-sentenced in October, which they duly were. And now, they are required to report to prison Jan. 4, to finish their five-year sentences. Patriot groups and other supporters of the Hammonds say that the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against 'double jeopardy' that is, 'be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' Others have suggested that perhaps there is another element at play a religious element, in particular. Like, what if the Hammonds were a part of a politically protected religious and ethnic group? selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, laid it out clearly. 'If the Hammond family were of Muslim faith, the entire mainstream media would be screaming about how ridiculous this terrorism charge is,' he said. 'But solely because they are white people living a rural lifestyle, they are condemned by the media and largely ignored even as they face the extreme tyranny of an unjust federal government gone bad.' In fact, as evidenced by the live stream supplied by Santilli and Jordan, the only 'mainstream media' seen in hours of coverage monitored by selfnews was a news team from KOIN 6 , which filed this story . There is real terrorism but burning some grass isn't As the protect and resultant march by patriots and supporters proceeded through the streets of Burn, there were no calls for violence, no rioting or looting, no threats or intimidation and, noted at one point by Jordan no massive police presence. In fact, she said she hadn't seen one officer the entire time. And yet, the Hammonds have been portrayed, literally, as 'terrorists' because of accidentally burning some federal land - using a technique that the BLM itself has utilized and which has damaged private property though no one was ever charged or held responsible. Can you imagine a Muslim family being charged thusly for a fire that, say, got out of hand at a campsite on federal land? Those happen all the time. This may sound like apples and oranges, but really the point of this piece is to point out the hypocrisy of the politically correct Left-wing mainstream media , which has gone out of its way to protect Muslims in an age where adherents to the Islamic faith have used it as an excuse to kill Americans (you know - real terrorism).

0," Recently Senator Charles Grassley, ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has been looking into financial ties between the pharmaceutical industry and the academic physicians who largely determine the market value of prescription drugs. He hasn't had to look very hard. (Story by Marcia Angell, republished from NYBooks.com ) Take the case of Dr. Joseph L. Biederman, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chief of pediatric psychopharmacology at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital. Thanks largely to him, children as young as two years old are now being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with a cocktail of powerful drugs, many of which were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose and none of which were approved for children below ten years of age. Legally, physicians may use drugs that have already been approved for a particular purpose for any other purpose they choose, but such use should be based on good published scientific evidence. That seems not to be the case here. Biederman's own studies of the drugs he advocates to treat childhood bipolar disorder were, as The New York Times summarized the opinions of its expert sources, 'so small and loosely designed that they were largely inconclusive.' In June, Senator Grassley revealed that drug companies , including those that make drugs he advocates for childhood bipolar disorder, had paid Biederman $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees between 2000 and 2007. Two of his colleagues received similar amounts. After the revelation, the president of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the chairman of its physician organization sent a letter to the hospital's physicians expressing not shock over the enormity of the conflicts of interest, but sympathy for the beneficiaries: 'We know this is an incredibly painful time for these doctors and their families, and our hearts go out to them.' Or consider Dr. Alan F. Schatzberg, chair of Stanford's psychiatry department and president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association. Senator Grassley found that Schatzberg controlled more than $6 million worth of stock in Corcept Therapeutics, a company he cofounded that is testing mifepristone--the abortion drug otherwise known as RU-486--as a treatment for psychotic depression. At the same time, Schatzberg was the principal investigator on a National Institute of Mental Health grant that included research on mifepristone for this use and he was coauthor of three papers on the subject. In a statement released in late June, Stanford professed to see nothing amiss in this arrangement, although a month later, the university's counsel announced that it was temporarily replacing Schatzberg as principal investigator 'to eliminate any misunderstanding.' Perhaps the most egregious case exposed so far by Senator Grassley is that of Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff, chair of Emory University's department of psychiatry and, along with Schatzberg, coeditor of the influential Textbook of Psychopharmacology. Nemeroff was the principal investigator on a five-year $3.95 million National Institute of Mental Health grant--of which $1.35 million went to Emory for overhead--to study several drugs made by GlaxoSmithKline. To comply with university and government regulations, he was required to disclose to Emory income from GlaxoSmithKline, and Emory was required to report amounts over $10,000 per year to the National Institutes of Health, along with assurances that the conflict of interest would be managed or eliminated. But according to Senator Grassley, who compared Emory's records with those from the company, Nemeroff failed to disclose approximately $500,000 he received from GlaxoSmithKline for giving dozens of talks promoting the company's drugs. In June 2004, a year into the grant, Emory conducted its own investigation of Nemeroff's activities, and found multiple violations of its policies. Nemeroff responded by assuring Emory in a memorandum, 'In view of the NIMH/Emory/GSK grant, I shall limit my consulting to GSK to under $10,000/year and I have informed GSK of this policy.' Yet that same year, he received $171,031 from the company, while he reported to Emory just $9,999--a dollar shy of the $10,000 threshold for reporting to the National Institutes of Health. Emory benefited from Nemeroff's grants and other activities, and that raises the question of whether its lax oversight was influenced by its own conflicts of interest. As reported by Gardiner Harris in The New York Times , Nemeroff himself had pointed out his value to Emory in a 2000 letter to the dean of the medical school, in which he justified his membership on a dozen corporate advisory boards by saying: Surely you remember that Smith-Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals donated an endowed chair to the department and there is some reasonable likelihood that Janssen Pharmaceuticals will do so as well. In addition, Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals has funded a Research Career Development Award program in the department, and I have asked both AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Meyers [sic] Squibb to do the same. Part of the rationale for their funding our faculty in such a manner would be my service on these boards. Read the entire article at NYBooks.com . "
0," Sentiment is rising among local sheriffs all across the country to take a stand against what they perceive as a wave of unconstitutional gun control laws coming down the pike, with many pledging to ignore measures that would ban certain firearms or otherwise punish law-abiding gun owners with new, onerous restrictions. In Missouri, Johnson County Sheriff Charles M. Heiss is urging state colleagues, as well as sheriffs from all over the nation, to send a letter to the White House similar to one that he says he sent to the president Jan. 16 . In the letter, Heiss - who said he has held his office since 1997 - expressed concern with the 'tone' of the administration regarding the White House's pledge to use whatever means necessary to impose new gun control measures. 'Sworn duty' to protect the citizens and the Constitution 'It appears to me and many Americans that there is a genuine desire on the part of your administration to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law abiding American citizens in the interest of curbing gun violence in our nation,' Heiss wrote. 'Any attempt to restrict these Second Amendment rights through executive order is unconstitutional and tantamount to an all-out assault on the United States Constitution.' Heiss goes on to tell Obama in the letter that he has a 'sworn duty' to protect his constituents not just from the criminal element, but from any federal efforts to deny them their constitutional rights. Michael Dixon, a newly elected sheriff in Osage County, located in the central part of the state, is one of about a dozen sheriffs in Missouri who have signed Heiss' letter and sent it to Washington, CBS affiliate KMOX reported. 'On the same day the president is taking his oath to uphold the Constitution, he continues to attack our Second Amendment rights,' Dixon said. 'As Osage County Sheriff, I also took an oath to the Constitution , but unlike Obama, I intend to uphold mine.' Dixon also said he supported Missouri House Bill 170, which would criminalize any effort by local, state or federal law enforcement officials who tried to enforce any of the gun control measures currently under consideration by Congress or implemented by Obama as executive orders. 'The president comes from Chicago...' 'President Obama should quit his attempts to take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens and instead focus on stopping the criminals that will get them no matter what,' Dixon said. 'It is imperative we strengthen the penalty for criminals who use weapons in the commission of a crime or to cause bodily harm.' He added that his office won't enforce any new gun control proposals that violate the Bill of Rights . He also pointed to previous and existing gun control efforts and crime statistics that demonstrate gun bans don't work. 'The President comes from Chicago, the city with the strictest gun laws and worst gun violence in the country,' said Dixon, according to KMOX . 'It has been proven time and time again that taking guns from law abiding citizens only emboldens thugs, thieves, and rapists, not stop them from committing crimes.' What would your sheriff do? Here are some other local law enforcement officials who have made similar pledges: -- Collin County, Texas, Sheriff Terry Box has declared that neither he nor his deputies would enforce unconstitutional gun laws passed or decreed by those he calls misguided politicians . In a statement laying out his position, Box said: In light of recent events I feel I need to make a public statement of my views on this subject. As the Sheriff of Collin County, Texas, I have for the past 28 years served to protect and keep safe all citizens of our county, recognizing the trust placed in me with this profoundly important responsibility. Unfortunately, the recent surge in the numbers of innocent victims who have died at the hands of unstable criminals has prompted politicians in Washington to seek to pass laws that would seriously erode the constitutional rights of innocent and law abiding citizens. Neither I, nor any of my deputies, will participate in the enforcement of laws that violate our precious constitutional rights, including our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As long as I remain Sheriff of Collin County, I will not participate in the actions of misguided politicians who seek to impede our citizen's right to all of the privileges afforded by our Constitution. -- Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, during a recent town-hall style meeting, declared his unequivocal defense of the Second Amendment and the sheriff's historic role as the dominant law enforcement official in his jurisdiction: You'll understand me very well when you leave here today, and why we're all still going to have our guns here in Jackson. I am responsible for the people inside this county... I couldn't justify, if [President] Obama passes this, it doesn't matter what he passes, the sheriff has more power than the federal people. They need to go back and study that. We are a commonwealth. I can ask federal people to leave, they have to leave. I can ask state people to leave, they have to leave. . Peyman was http://youtu.be . -- Arizona's Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu has sent a letter to Obama stating that he will not obey unconstitutional executive orders banning firearms. I have sworn a solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America when I was first sworn in as an Army Private, later as an Army Officer, then as a Police Officer and now twice as the constitutionally elected Sheriff. You too, Mr. President, have taken the same oath, therefore I am gravely alarmed - just as most Americans are - that you would attempt to circumvent the Constitution of the United States. What will your local sheriff do? Now is the time to call him and ask.

0," True medicine does no harm and promotes self healing within. Modern medicine operates in the exact opposite manner. Nearly all pharmaceuticals mask symptoms while throwing off vital inner workings of various systems of the body. For instance, a specific class of drugs has been shown to make users slower and dumber, delaying their cognitive processes. On top of that, these drugs, which include some very common over-the-counter and prescription meds, scientifically put users at greater risk of dementia. These are the findings according to a new study from the University of Washington, Seattle. These classes of drugs all fall under a class of anticholinergic medications. This includes antihistamines, sleep aids, cold medicine, and antidepressants. Anticholinergic meds work by blocking a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. In doing so, these meds prohibit acetylcholine from naturally binding to its receptors in the brain. This slows cognitive processing, making the user slower to respond and dumber altogether. Common antidepressants, sleep aids, anti-histamines, and cold meds cause cognitive dysfunction that leads to dementia The University of Washington study tracked a large group of people who used anticholinergic meds every day for over three years. In a seven year follow up period, the researchers found that users were 10 percent more likely to receive a dementia diagnosis than those who didn't use the pills. These findings help explain why common over the counter cold medications, antihistamines, prescription sleep meds, and antidepressants cause brain fog, impaired memory, and loss of attention span. It's simple. These meds destroy the natural science of the human brain, blocking an important neurotransmitter, ultimately resulting in cognitive dysfunction. 'It's possible that long-term use of these medications leads to changes in the brain similar to those seen with Alzheimer's disease, such as neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles,' says study coauthor Sascha Dublin, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Dublin suggests that patients talk to their doctor about stopping these meds to find more productive options for healing that don't destroy cognitive function. Choose a path to healing that does no harm From experience, we know that quality vitamin D, Siberian ginseng, turmeric, green tea, passionflower, and oat straw are all helpful for nervous system healing and balancing. Supplementing with these herbs along with whole food zinc, selenium, and chromium can help one overcome the challenges of depression and insomnia without subjecting oneself to heinous psychotic and metabolic side effects of prescription psych meds, which only cause cognitive dysfunction and pharmaceutical dependence. From experience, we know that colds and excess histamine production can be thwarted using a blend of medicinal herbal teas including but not limited to: licorice root, Echinacea, mullein, marshmallow root, elderberry, cats claw bark, and amalaki berry. Subjecting oneself to over-the-counter cold medications and anti-histamines is an abusive practice that destroys cognitive function, memory, and attention. The above mentioned herbs are more effective long term and balance other systems of the body including the immune system and digestive system. When we see modern medicine for what it really is, we learn to turn the other cheek and look into the infinite healing wisdom and depth of nature, nutrition, and the true healing energies within the Earth that restore our body systems without doing us harm.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Daily use of mouthwash has been linked to increased incidents of oral cancer, erosion of tooth enamel, increased tooth sensitivity, and higher levels of bad breath according to recent studies. In the first study, researchers from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil reviewed case-control studies from 1998 to 2002. A total of 309 patients with oral cancer of the mouth and pharynx and 468 controls matched by sex and age were included. Detailed information on smoking, alcohol consumption, schooling, and oral health and hygiene were obtained through interviews. Results indicated that daily mouthwash use was strongly associated with cancer of the pharynx and also associated with cancer of the mouth. Surprisingly, the use of full dental prosthesis was not associated with oral cancer, although bleeding gums and failure to have dental visits were also strongly associated. In another study, at the Division of Restorative Dentistry in Bristol, U.K., researchers found that use of low pH mouthwashes cause erosion of dental enamel that is directly correlated to sensitivity in teeth. People with less enamel complained of much greater tooth sensitivity to hot and cold. The study measured both in situ and in vitro erosion by three low pH mouthwashes. Results showed that enamel loss in situ and in vitro was progressive over time with all three mouthwashes. The team recommended that low pH mouthwashes should not be considered for long term or continuous use and should never be used prior to brushing. Low pH indicates high acidity levels. Most common mouthwash products sold at traditional retail outlets are highly acidic. Listerine has a pH of 4.3, and Scope has a pH of 5.0. Neutral pH is 7.0 with declining values indicating increased levels of acidity. Healthy body saliva has a pH of 6.4 to 6.8. Most people use mouthwash to eliminate bad breath caused by food stuck between the teeth and bacteria which feed off this accumulation of food. But experts say that mouthwash doesn't live up to its reputation. It works for a short period of time by killing lots of germs. But this is followed by the high alcohol content drying out the mouth. When saliva glands are dry, they are unable to help wash away bacteria, so it flourishes and causes even more bad breath. This is why babies always have sweet smelling breath since they produce so much saliva and drool a lot. So, mouthwash may make your breath smell better for a short period of time, but what have you done to your immune system, esophagus and stomach lining? And what about that chemical soup your liver is required to detoxify? Do you really need to add more chemicals to the toxic overload your body has to cope with daily? 'Could there be any correlation between the use of mouthwash and an epidemic known as acid reflux disease?' asks Crusador columnist Greg Ciola who realizes much more study is needed in this area. There are some new products on the market that help solve a bad breath situation in a health promoting manner. Spry and Peelu are two companies that each make a line of products sweetened with xylitol that includes chewing gum, toothpaste, oral rinse, and mints. These companies cite studies that have shown xylitol to help reduce the occurrence of cavities and improve overall oral health as well as sweeten breath. They are available in health food stores and online from such retailers as Lucky Vitamin and Vitacost.

0," No one knows who discovered the benefits of composting by planting seeds in the refuse of human, animal, mineral and vegetable waste materials. Regardless of its origin, it's clear that life grows from death. Drawing new life from the leavings of the past has been happening on earth since the beginning, and mankind can make use of this divine gift by turning raw materials into nutrient-rich compost for organic sustainability. Modern composting Organic gardening principles developed with earth herself; and it's only a matter of artistry, trial and error that man has discovered how to intensify the conditions that supply the benefits of composting. The bottom line is that the best compost is little more than rotting organic matter. Successful composting requires a basic knowledge of the process that operates in a compost heap; and, the realization that no matter what you do or how many small mistakes you make, you're still going to have reasonably decent compost. Rather than getting bogged down in numerous complex formulas and techniques, start simply and follow basic guidelines for making good compost. You can complicate it later. The benefits of composting Compost adds nutrients and micronutrients to the soil and boosts plant growth and yields. Nutrients are released at a rate related to the plant's needs, depending on the temperature and available moisture. Compost binds with soil improving its texture and structure. Healthy soil organically sustains your plants, providing better moisture, oxygen for root growth and improved drainage. It increases the soil's capacity to hold 200 percent of its dry weight in water. Composting attracts nature's soil builders in the form of earthworms and friendly insects that rejuvenate the soil and increase plant growth. It also helps balance the pH in the soil and acts like a buffer making plants more resilient and less dependent on specific pH levels. Organic composting materials A basic guide to achieve composing benefits is to build your compost from two parts vegetable matter and one part animal matter -- manure. Materials included must be biodegradable and contain nutrients that are available and usable to microorganisms. Examples of organic vegetable matter include pond algae, wood ashes, coffee grinds, feathers, organic kitchen garbage -- except grease, oil and animal fats --, dry dog food -- which activates nitrogen --, eggshells, flowers, grass clippings, leaves, weeds, and kelp. There are many more. Activating organic compost By adding an activator, you speed up the process to obtain composting benefits by providing a nitrogen-protein source and enzymes to feed the microcommunity. Organic activators include finished compost , compost tea, and well-rotted, dried manure. For vegetarians who prefer not using animal manure, protein meal can be used as an activator. Additional factors in making a decision before deriving the benefits of composting are locating your compost pile, maintaining its appearance and size, proper drainage, aeration, and insulation for those in colder climates. Speeding decomposition Breaking down the raw materials into nutrient-rich organic matter is the goal and speeding decomposition is usually necessary to gain optimal composting benefits. Adding moisture as you build the pile, wetting it down periodically and aerating with frequent turning of the materials in the compost pile increase microbial action for breaking down materials at an accelerated rate. Getting started Getting started is the most important thing in establishing organic sustainability by utilizing the benefits of composting for organic gardens. Plant some seeds; start your compost pile and learn as you go. Borrow what you need from the earth and give back what you have in abundance to stay in the natural flow.

0," In a ruling that many holistic healers and homeopathic physicians are likely to find hypocritical, a federal court has handed Big Pharma an unprecedented victory by giving a drug company preliminary approval to market a drug for a condition for which it has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The drug, Vascepa, manufactured by Amarin Pharma, is approved for use in treating very high levels of fats known as triglycerides over 500 mg per deciliter in a patient's bloodstream, reports AllGov.com. But Amarin also wanted to promote the medication for use in patients who have 'persistently high levels' of triglycerides, from 200 to 499 mg/deciliter. The FDA denied that request earlier this year over concerns that Vascepa would not help such patients avoid heart attacks or heart disease. That decision led Amarin to file suit in court, claiming its First Amendment rights permitted the company to provide information to physicians and other primary care providers. Providers have long prescribed medications for 'off-label' uses those not included in a drug's literature or for uses not specifically approved by federal regulators but the drug companies have traditionally been banned from marketing their products for such off-label uses. 'I find the decision very troubling' However, in recent days U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama in 2011, ruled to give Amarin preliminary relief, stating the company was permitted to 'engage in truthful and non-misleading speech promoting the off-label use of Vascepa.' 'This is huge,' Jacob Sherkow, an associate professor at New York Law School, told The Washington Post . 'There have been other instances a court has held that off-label marketing is protected by the First Amendment, but... this is the first time, I think, that any federal court that any court has held in such a clear, full-throated way that off-label marketing is protected by the First Amendment, period, full stop.' AllGov.com reported that the case stemmed from a 2012 New York City federal appeals court ruling finding that a Big Pharma sales rep had not violated FDA regulations by promoting off-label use for a drug to treat narcolepsy, Xyrem, because his speech as long as he was not being misleading was protected by the First Amendment. However, in the Amarin case, the FDA said that the Xyrem decision was limited in scope and therefore could not be applied to Vascepa, but Engelmayer disagreed. However, the parameter of 'truthful speech' and a complete statement of facts has proved concerning to some. 'I find the decision very troubling. It's a big push off on to a very slippery slope, a very steep slippery slope toward removing the government's authority to limit the claims that drug companies can make about the effectiveness of their products,' Harvard Medical School professor Jerry Avorn told the Post . 'There's an enormous amount, enormous numbers of statements that drug companies could make about their products that are not overtly fraudulent, but are not the same as a comprehensive review of all the good and bad evidence, that the FDA undertakes when it reviews a drug,' Avorn added. Two standards The Amarin suit and ruling is narrow, as it involves a company's right to promote just one drug as a treatment for those with high triglycerides thought to be a factor in heart disease. Nevertheless, the case is being watched closely because it might serve as a vehicle to eventually restrict the FDA's ability to curb off-label promotion of all drugs, the Post noted. Makers and consumers of health-related supplements, however, are also decrying the ruling, especially companies whose First Amendment rights have been ignored by courts and the FDA in the past. In December 2012, we reported that a federal appeals court in New York upheld the free speech rights of a pharmaceutical company regarding off-label uses of Xyrem, even as courts and the FDA were gagging makers of natural supplements. And in March 2013, we reported that the FDA used a truth-in-labeling regulation in issuing warning letters to a pair of supplement companies whose 'crime' was nothing more than having customer-related interactions via the Internet. It appears that there are two separate standards for Big Pharma and holistic and homeopathic healers. Sources: AllGov.com WashingtonPost.com WSJ.com selfnews.com "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) On September 21, a California federal district court found that the USDA's 2004 approval of Monsanto's genetically engineered 'Roundup Ready' sugar beets was unlawful. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) deregulated GMO sugar beets without preparing an Environmental Impact Statement. Plaintiffs in the case, filed in January 2008, include the Center for Food Safety, the Organic Seed Alliance, the Sierra Club, and High Mowing Seeds. Failing to account for cross-pollination of the GMO seeds with nearby fields of conventional and organic varieties was one of many unreasonable deficiencies cited by the court in the original USDA approval of the crop. Plaintiffs in the case are also emphasizing in no uncertain terms that they will not tolerate the continued pandering to the likes of Monsanto by the USDA. The USDA's job is to protect America's growers, farmers, and consumers, not multinational corporations who patent genetically-altered seeds. When Monsanto originally began marketing its 'Roundup Ready' GMO sugar beet seeds, it enticed farmers with promises that the crops could be doused with herbicide up to five times a year without killing the crop. What it failed to disclose was the potential for entire crop fields to be cross-contaminated with genetically modified seeds, devastating the availability of untainted conventional and organic crops. The environmental impact of using GMO seeds is tremendous and could wipe out the non-GMO crops entirely. Another issue not addressed by APHIS is the fact that continual applications of glyphosate, the herbicide marketed by Monsanto as Roundup, has led to the growth of Roundup-resistant weeds commonly referred to as 'superweeds'. Similar to antibiotic 'superbugs' that become resistant to antibiotics, these superweeds require ever-increasing amounts of not only Roundup but other more potent, toxic herbicides just to keep them under control. There are currently millions of U.S. land acres that are infested with superweeds. An independent analysis of USDA data by the former Executive Director of the National Academy of Sciences' Board on Agriculture, Dr. Charles Benbrook, has revealed some startling information. Between 1996, when 'Roundup Ready' genetically engineered crops were first introduced, and 2004, herbicide use in the U.S. has increased by 138 million pounds. A 2008 study conducted at the University of Caen in France found that Monsanto's Roundup concoctions triggered the death of human embryonic, placental, and umbilical cells in vitro. The dilution levels used in the study were far below the recommendation levels used in agriculture and were meant to replicate the amount ingested due to residue left on food. Despite the tremendous victory this case represents, there is still the unfortunate reality that the lead defendant in the case was USDA head Thomas Vilsack, an Obama hand pick who heavily supports genetic engineering. Other appointments to top USDA positions under the Obama administration include many former Monsanto executives, perpetuating the Bush-era legacy of revolving-door politics that favors corporate agribusiness and GMOs at the expense of food freedom and consumer protection. In his ruling, Judge Jeffrey S. White has scheduled a meeting on October 30 to deliberate the remediation phase of the case that may include injunctive relief against the use of GE sugar beets.

0," A large part of Mexico's agricultural export is honey. They are ranked fifth worldwide for exporting the bees' food, but recently Germany rejected a batch of honey from Mexico. Pollen from genetically modified (GM) soybean plants was found in the honey being imported. Bee keepers in the region and agricultural authorities of the Mexican state of Campeche, one of the states in the Yucatan Peninsula at the southeastern tip of Mexico, were mystified. So a research team familiar with bees and Mexico came in to determine what was going on with GMOs affecting bee colonies in Campeche. Apparently, some locals thought that GMO contamination from crops considered safe for human consumption was okay in other nations. There is plenty of GM soy declared fit for human consumption in Mexico. Others didn't realize that the bees from local apiaries would be collecting pollen from nearby GM soybean plants. No matter, German buyers weren't buying. David Roubik, senior staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and his colleagues found that six honey samples from nine hives in the Campeche region contained soy pollen in addition to pollen from many wild plant species. The pollen came from crops near the bee colonies in several small apiaries. According to a quote by Roubik from a source article, 'Bee colonies act as extremely sensitive environmental indicators. Bees from a single colony may gather nectar and pollen resources from flowers in a 200-square-kilometer area.' [1] So how would the USDA's four-mile buffer between GMO and non-GMO fields work if that's true? Meanwhile, back in the USA The rural area of Jackson County in Oregon has been a controversial hot spot of food war activity with local non-GMO farmers raising their fists to battle Syngenta's GM intrusions that have already contaminated some of their organic or standard commercial crops and seeds. Syngenta is not allowed to seed their GM creations on open fields in Switzerland, where they have their headquarters, because GMO cultivation is banned there. So they seek other regions where the land is fertile and the climate's right and rent plots to try out their GM crop seeds and see how well they resist herbicides like Roundup or whatever else they think should be tested agriculturally. Safety and contamination testing isn't part of their agenda. Jackson County has been invaded by Syngenta, and their experimental GM crops have violated the four-mile buffer zone mandated by the USDA for beet and chard seed plots. Syngenta had fields within one mile of three organic farming operations, and further investigation has discovered that Syngenta had been in Jackson County operating undercover in unmarked rented fields since 2009. [2] This area is big on cultivating organic beet and chard seeds and other organic crops. Sugar beets and chard are of the same species, Beta vulgaris . So Syngenta's GM beets threaten both non-GMO and organic beets and chard, and their seeds. Since agricultural authorities are not listening to these local farmers, they formed their own movement called 'GMO Free Jackson County.' The created a petition to bring the whole matter of banning GMO seeds and cultivation to Jackson County. After obtaining over 6,700 signatures, Measure 15-119 to completely ban GMO seeds and farming will be on the ballot May 20, 2014. [3] In Canada, non-GM alfalfa farmers are resisting Health Canada's green light to start planting GM alfalfa in eastern Canadian provinces, which are not as involved in exporting alfalfa and alfalfa seeds to nations that reject GMOs. Western and Central provinces need that market. So they are putting up the most resistance without much support. Canada has already had major agricultural losses with non-GM flax and flax seed contamination from GM flax, as well as large scale issues with organic canola. In Washington State (USA) during the summer of 2013, an alfalfa farmer's hay was rejected from export because of GMO contamination. [4] There is no possibility of non-GMO and GMO co-existence without contamination , despite GMO industry and corrupt agricultural agency reassurances. Pushing for consumer labeling implies that co-existence is okay. It is not! Label laws won't matter when all organic or non-GM crop foods are contaminated from GM seeds and crops. There needs to be a cooperative effort between consumers and non-GMO farmers to resist biotech industry's takeover of the food supply by banning its cultivation in as many local areas as possible. Retail labeling will do nothing to stop these GMO monsters, especially here in a fast-food nation where most don't really care what's in their food. "
0," In what is quickly shaping up to be the biggest and most serious Obama White House scandal since the fraudulent birth certificate fiasco , the recent attack on the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which resulted in four Americans being killed, has caused widespread public outrage at the Obama administration for its apparent willful refusal to protect American life. According to emerging reports, the Obama administration was fully aware of the attack as it was occurring, but deliberately ordered a 'stand down' rather than send help. The mainstream media is all over the map in its coverage of this shocking incident, which many are now referring to as 'Benghazigate,' but the truth of the matter is that there is no way the White House did not know what was occurring at the outpost, regardless of claims to the contrary. Repeated petitions for help from those on the ground in Benghazi went unanswered, which the White House has since tried to cover up with all sorts of excuses. Leaked information reveals not only that the White House knew full well about the attack as it was happening , but deliberately did nothing about it, which some have already dubbed a blatant act of treason by the occupying administration. Then, there is the inconvenient fact that the Obama administration had already been caught involved in a major CIA gun-running operation that included shipping 400 tons of weapons and military gear into and through Libya, which some are now calling 'Fast and Furious II.' There is also speculation among some that Ambassador Stevens, who was killed in the recent attack, had actually been directly involved in this gun running scheme prior to his death, which raises even more questions about what actually took place during the melee. Was General Ham fired from his position at AFRICOM for trying to help protect American life? It has also been revealed that General Carter F. Ham, who had been a top commander for U.S. AFRICOM, was immediately removed from his post after attempting to defy orders from the White House ordering him to stand down and do nothing in response to the attack. This was confirmed on October 18 when Barack Obama made an announcement nominating Gen. David M. Rodriguez to replace the now-fired Gen. Ham, who many familiar with the largely unreported details of the chilling saga are hailing as a hero. There are so many details and criss-crossing paths of information, in fact, that it is difficult to know exactly what took place on that fateful day, and what the motivations were behind the decision to order a stand down . Many important questions remain unanswered, and the mainstream media seems mostly disinterested in getting to the bottom of the issue, instead choosing to accept the official and ever-evolving story about this dastardly scourge in American history. 'The breach on America's diplomatic outpost in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens, two Navy SEALs and an additional civil servant dead, is a foreign policy debacle so colossal, so convoluted, that piecing together its moving parts may be nearly an impossible feat,' wrote Tiffany Gabbay from The Blaze recently about the fiasco.

0," Tweet The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew nearly five years ago about the dangers associated with the diabetes drug Avandia, an internal FDA memo shows. A study released Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine showed a 43 percent increase in heart attacks in people using Avandia. In a letter sent today to FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, Public Citizen described how the 2002 memo showed that FDA scientists recommended that labels for Avandia and Actos, another widely prescribed diabetes drug, be amended to include mention of post-marketing reports of heart failure among patients taking the two drugs. To date, the label hasn't changed. 'The failure of the FDA to act on the recommendations made almost five years ago by its Division of Drug Risk Evaluation is yet another case in which the conclusions of scientists who are engaged in post-market drug safety review are not taken seriously enough or addressed soon enough,' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at Public Citizen. 'As a result, millions of people to the detriment of their health are prescribed drugs whose risks are dangerously understated, instead of being prescribed safer, equally or more effective alternative drugs.' The July 16, 2002, memo shows that, at the time, the FDA had 47 adverse reaction reports in which the use of Avandia (25 cases) and Actos (22 cases) resulted in hospitalization for heart failure. As of last fall, the number of such cases had increased to 803 (415, Avandia ; 388, Actos). The total number of prescriptions filled for Avandia and Actos in 2006 was 22 million (11 million for each). Wolfe called on the FDA to either put a black-box-warning on the drugs or to ban them altogether. He also noted that the post-market drug safety review division should be independent from the rest of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and that legislation to make it independent was introduced this year by Sens. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) but was not included in legislation recently passed by the Senate. The bill has not yet passed the House, which could make this change. Click here to read the FDA memo (PDF). Click here to read Public Citizen's letter to the FDA's Dr. von Eschenbach Opinion and Analysis by Adams The discovery of this memo demonstrates, once again, that the FDA operates in conspiracy with Big Pharma to hide the dangers of prescription drugs that pose a real safety threat to Americans. As I have stated many times on this website, the FDA has become the No. 1 threat to the health and safety of the American people. It is now an agency that acts as the marketing department of Big Pharma, covering up the drug industry's lies, plotting to 'disappear' damaging findings, and accelerating the approval of drugs that are killing Americans at a rate not even witnessed during the Vietnam War. The FDA is a rogue agency that has abandoned real science and abandoned its stated mission of protecting the public from unsafe drugs. I believe we are way past merely needing to reform the FDA; I think it is time to investigate and prosecute its top decision makers for engaging in crimes against humanity. For more details about the true history of the FDA, including armed raids, book burnings, scientific fraud, intimidation and censorship tactics, read my latest book, Natural Health Solutions and the Conspiracy to Keep You From Knowing About Them . Statistically, the FDA has become a far greater threat to the safety of Americans than terrorism. Consider this: If a terrorist set off a nucler bomb in a football stadium, killing 50,000 people in an instant, that would only be half the number of Americans killed each year by FDA-approved drugs . And yet the FDA shows no signs whatsoever of reforming its criteria for drug safety or divesting itself from Big Pharma influence. In fact, thanks to the U.S. Senate, the FDA will soon be even more financially intertwined with drug companies who pay 'user fees' to the FDA to have their drugs approved. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Did you know the exciting thing about breast cancer is that your chances of getting it are only one in twelve women? And that's directly from the Breast Cancer Institute. The other good news is that it is preventable and 90% of women diagnosed in the early stages go on to lead normal, healthy lives. Whether you have breast cancer or if you are just concerned about the possibility of having a problem in that area, pop onto the Internet and you will find approximately 15,500,000 sites on treating breast cancer. The information on these sites varies from the extreme conventional approach to the extreme alternate. From total invasion therapy such as chemotherapy to massive dosages of some expensive product someone is trying to push. It is likely to leave the average person full of information but more confused than when they started. Like prostate cancer in men, everybody seems to have a different idea. What is very interesting is that I had to search very diligently to find any mention of prevention or treatment by lifestyle. There is an absolute avalanche of information on conventional treatment with billions of our money being spent on research, chemo, radiation and surgery, but genuine natural preventative methods are thin on the ground and usually difficult to seek out, but persevere, they are out there. Doctors are often very reluctant to recommend alternatives because they are scared of malpractice suits, due to their insurance which doesn't cover alternatives plus the medical boards can and do suspend their licenses or fine them heavily. Besides which, only a small percentage of medical professionals know very much about alternatives anyway. Bureaucracy, politicians, lawyers; pharmaceutical companies dominate and control our conventional 'health care' system. They rule the treatments, not doctors. A few things you should know about cancer treatments: Yes, alternative therapies do work when used in conjunction with an experienced practitioner. Almost all alternative therapies have documented scientific studies to back them up. These studied developments invariably take place outside the conventional system so go unreported. Some successful treatments are hundreds of years old and yet are still ignored by the media and mainstream medicine. To date the public has generally been kept in the dark but fortunately the Internet and media interests are opening doors. Basically, if you get the main alternative categories into perspective and put them all together you will obtain the best preventative results. These categories include nutrition, organic and raw foods (to retain the vital enzymes), exercise, detoxification, relaxation, mental and emotional attitude, avoiding electromagnetic radiation and re-building your immune system. It is vital to keep an open mind. There are two things that distinguish a survivor from those who do not survive. Survivors have the strongest desire to live and to carry on with their lives. They ask questions, they read books; they check the Internet, listen to tapes and make phone calls. That way they find out what will work for them. These people are not afraid to do something both different and positive. Some big mistakes regarding alternatives: Believing that if alternatives do work, then the conventional system would use them. That is so wrong! Conventional medicine produces mind-blowing profits for the giant international drug companies. As you would appreciate, inexpensive alternate therapies pose a threat to the profitability of the entire existing 'health' system. Do not think that using alternatives means you have to totally abandon conventional doctors and therapies. Always work with your professional and tell them what you are doing. If they don't like it, then find one who is sympathetic. They are around. It is not a do-it-yourself project but at the same time it is your body, so do what you think is best for you. Be aware that the medical profession tends to forget that we are all different, whereas alternative therapies treat each case individually. Importantly try to avoid family or friends attempting to influence your decisions . Drive your own bus, the fewer people that know what you are actually doing about your self treatment the better. Do not search for a 'magic' pill. Lots of changes in your lifestyle will be mandatory. If you keep doing the same old things you always did, you will always get the same result! Lastly, do not wait until you are told all hope is gone with conventional therapies before 'trying' alternatives. By then it may make your recovery a lot slower. The sooner you start the quicker the results, just keep an open mind. Some very important things to: Remember prevention is better than cure. Change your lifestyle now whatever your current situation. It's vital to obtain a healthy eating pattern. After all, we are what we absorb and if you continue to put junk with no nutrition into your body, you will only increase your chances of continuing problems. One of the proven methods so correctly espoused by all alternate practitioners is raw food. Foods that are eaten raw retain the vital enzymes that are eliminated by cooking. Most people go 'Oh! Erk,' but in fact raw food actually tastes better than cooked food, we just need to rearrange our perverted 21 st century taste buds! Educate yourself, research, join alternate support groups, exercise, and look also at yoga, massages, aromatherapy, homoeopathy, Chinese medicine plus relaxation and meditation techniques. Interestingly the body does not know the difference between what is real and what is imagined. It only knows what the mind tells it. If you keep telling your body that it is well and don't mention your problems, don't ever use the word cancer , don't even talk about it and your body will not know it may have a problem. Now I know to some that may sound a little outlandish, but there is plenty of proof in the five most important words in the English language and they are 'whatever you think, you create'. You create your thoughts, no one else does. You can think negative thoughts or positive thoughts; it's entirely up to you! Whatever you think, it will affect your body. Some other thoughts: There was an article in the UK Times Newspaper (Nov 06) concerning women actually having their breasts removed to avoid the risk of cancer. Apparently 12% of English women are either having a double mastectomy or seriously considering it. Surely there's something wrong in our society that women can be conned into such a major decision merely because they have a supposed 'high risk'? Can you imagine a man having his private parts removed in case he got cancer of the prostate? I think not. Giving in before the possibility of anything happening is totally insane. 'High risk' is just two words, nothing more. What on earth is wrong with prevention? If you take charge of your lifestyle and cut out or at least down on the chocolates, coffee, cigarettes, white flour, de-natured foods in packets and tins, foods full of chemicals, cola style drinks and turn off that mobile phone you will be on the right path. I have heard patients say, 'Oh, I couldn't do that; life would not be worth living'. One thing for sure is that the alternative will be a painful, miserable old age (if you get that far). What you need to be looking for is quality of life, not just living!

0," The latest revelation regarding the Zika virus involves a genetically-altered mosquito project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation an experiment which some suspect may have caused the rapid spread of a once-rare disease that is now expected to circulate around the globe. Zika virus has been linked to a birth defect called microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with brain damage and unusually small heads. Brazil has been labeled the 'epicenter' of the Zika virus outbreak, with more than a million cases reported there. Perhaps not coincidentally, Brazil is also the site where the GM mosquito project was carried out and it involved the same strain of mosquito said to be responsible for the spread of the virus. From The Event Chronicle : ' The Zika virus , which has been detected in 18 of the 26 states in Brazil, is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. A generically modified version has been developed by a British biotech company called Oxitec. 'The results of a trial in Brazil published this summer involved genetically engineered mosquitoes that allegedly fight the spread of dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika virus. 'But scientists have warned the study had too few controls in place to ensure that the mosquitoes released into the wild did not end up spreading dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika virus. 'In short, these genetically modified mosquitoes could be the cause of the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil and other parts of South and Central America.' There may be no conclusive evidence yet that the GM mosquito project funded by Gates has actually caused the spread of Zika, but it's a possibility well worth investigating. Was it an accident? At the very least, the project relied on sloppy science. In theory, only male mosquitoes were modified so that they would produce larvae that died before birth but there would always be some that survived. One of the sources of the Zika/GMO connection story was a recent Reddit post that has since gone viral. An excerpt from the Reddit post: 'The OX513A strain of male mosquitoes released in Juazeiro creates larvae that normally die in the absence of antibiotics , which is supposed to help decimate wild mosquito populations when these males are released in the wild. Problem here being of course, that 'life, uh, finds a way'. An estimated 3-4% of the larvae survive to adulthood in the absence of the tetracycline antibiotic. These larvae should then be free to go on and reproduce and pass on their genes. In fact, they may be the only ones that are passing on their genes in places that have their wild mosquito population decimated by these experiments.' There is further evidence that up to 15 percent of the GM mosquito offspring may be able to survive, due to the tetracycline antibiotic being present in the environment from other sources. And it seems that Oxitec, the company that developed the GM mosquito program was well aware of that fact. As reported by Zero Hedge : 'In fact, as a confidential internal Oxitec document divulged in 2012, that survival rate could be as high as 15% even with low levels of tetracycline present. 'Even small amounts of tetracycline can repress' the engineered lethality. Indeed, that 15% survival rate was described by Oxitec.' The saga continues It's easy to see where the Zika virus crisis might fit in with Bill Gates' admitted depopulation agenda . Not only are babies being born nearly brain-dead, but now women throughout Latin America are being urged not to have children during the next two years. Coincidence? And in the latest Zika news, GM mosquitoes are now being considered for use in fighting the further spread of the virus. And of course, researchers are scrambling to develop a vaccine . ...

0," In 1989, members of China's Democracy Movement staged a massive protest in Tiananmen Square. In response, the communist Chinese government commanded near-total control over the nation's media while dispatching heavily armed soldiers and tanks to surround and intimidate the protesters. Today, the U.S. government has dispatched hundreds of heavily armed soldiers, snipers and helicopters to lay siege to a ranch near Bunkerville Nevada, called the 'Bundy Ranch,' where the Bundy family has been running cattle since the 1870's. In 1949, the federal Bureau of Land Management was created, and in the 1990's the BLM claimed (false) authority to start charging 'grazing fees' for Bundy's cattle. Today, the BLM claims the Bundy family owes over $1 million to the government. Click here to see my video interview on WHDT World News where I explain what's really happening at the Bundy ranch in Nevada. Feds engage in Chinese-style brutality and violence In order to collect that $1 million and lay seize the land the Bundy family has been using for generations, the BLM in engaged in the very same kind of brutality and threat of violence that the Chinese government used against its protesters in 1989. I fact, similarities between the two are numerous: The mainstream media now functions as a total government mouthpiece, broadcasting lies and propaganda such as the false claim that 'a protester kicked one of the BLM's security dogs.' (In fact, a BLM officer verbally commanded the dog to attack the protesters.) This is similar to the Chinese government directly controlling virtually the entire Chinese press. The massive show of unjustified force, such as positioning government snipers on hilltops around the Bundy ranch, with line-of-sight inside the Bundy home so that shots can be taken to kill the Bundy family. The deployment of absurd 'overkill' hardware: Tanks in the case of China, and government helicopters in the case of the Bundy ranch in Nevada. It has also been reported by Pete Santilli and Adam Kokesh that BLM has hired Blackwater-style operatives to don BLM badges and wade into the scene as soldiers for hire. The intimidation and silencing of local law enforcement. In the case of the Bundy ranch in Nevada, the local Sheriff of Clark County has the constitutional authority to arrest all BLM personnel for felony theft of cattle and trespassing. Yet he has been intimidated into silence, thereby abandoning his own constituents. In China, officials who were friendly to the protesters were demoted, purged or kidnapped and killed by the Chinese government. The Chinese government declared Martial Law and arrested anyone they wished. Similarly in Nevada, the BLM has declared a state of effective Martial Law by threatening to arrest anyone who sets foot on the desert dirt. The BLM also set up a 'First Amendment Zone' and threatened to arrest anyone who strayed outside the zone who wished to express their First Amendment rights. Dave Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy was brutalized and arrested for taking photographs on a public highway.(1) See my appearance on broadcast TV news, explaining the truth about the government's armed siege of the Bundy ranch: Liberal media openly supports use of government violence against cowboys So far, the federal government has stolen over 350 head of cattle from the Bundy family. Cattle theft is a felony crime in the State of Nevada. The federal government, in fact, began this standoff by arriving on scene with heavy weapons and then proceeding to engage in multiple felony crimes. The federal government believes it has the right to do anything it wants to anybody it wants merely because it wields the most firepower . The federal government utterly lacks any legitimate authority to seize land which, under Common Law precedent, has been worked, protected and ranched by the Bundy family for over a century. The U.S. Constitution strictly forbids the federal government from interfering in state business. This limitation has been willfully ignored, of course, by the feds. The feds drew blood by shooting Dave Bundy with a Taser. A video shows Dave smacking the taser probes away from his body in self defense. This show of blood and violence against conservative ranchers is all but encouraged by the liberal media by their silence. If this were happening in any other country, the U.S. media would cover it as international news. The media's silence on this story is an endorsement of federal brutality against ranchers. If this were taking place in Russia, North Korea or China, it would be international news. But because it's taking place in America, the U.S. media has defaulted to near-silence as a way to cover for the Obama administration which apparently can do no wrong, not even when aiming government snipers at American families. The liberal media appears to wholly endorse these violent actions, including the brutality which has been exercised against innocent protesters, by trying to downplay the reality of the situation. The Washington Post, for example, characterized this massive armed siege as 'government wanting to move a few cattle, and some people aren't happy.' That sort of downplaying of reality smacks of a government-run press publishing propaganda rather than factual reporting. Without question, if Cliven Bundy happened to be openly gay -- as in Brokeback Mountain style -- mainstream media coverage would be entirely different. The cultural narrative now being pushed by TV shows, movies and the media is that it is perfectly acceptable to brutalize cowboys and conservatives, but not at all acceptable to even criticize those who choose alternative gay lifestyles. (I will even be verbally assaulted for merely bringing up the comparison!) Somehow, members of the Bundy family being 'cowboys' makes them automatically suspect in the distorted eyes of the liberal 'anti-liberty' media. I mention this because it is important to understand why the liberal media is intentionally standing by and doing nothing while innocent Americans are brutalized and threatened at gunpoint. In the minds of the lamestream media, ranchers, conservatives, meat producers and gun owners all deserve to die in violent acts perpetrated against them by a righteous government that controls all land and all natural resources. Therefore, the federal government must be doing the right thing in Nevada, they figure, and anyone who takes a stand in defense of a meat-producing cowboy is obviously not to be taken seriously, they imply. Shame on the mainstream media -- the propaganda arm of the U.S. government -- for ignoring this Tiananmen-style assault on fundamental American freedoms. This is not the America we all know! This is a nation of government tyranny and media complicity to silence the truth and destroy fundamental freedoms. "
0," The Obama administration and its gun-grabbing allies in Congress are planning to exploit the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in a renewed bid to take away guns and gun rights. But in the days following the massacre of 20 first graders and six adults, the Gallup polling firm found that, by overwhelming majorities, most citizens favor decidedly different solutions to prevent further senseless attacks on our nation's schools. According to the survey, the most popular option chosen by respondents is boosting police presence at schools; 53 percent of respondents said more police would be 'very effective' at reducing acts of mass murder, while another 34 percent said it would be 'somewhat effective.' In addition to boosting protective measures, Americans also believe that increasing funding and access to mental health services would be an effective deterrent. The Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, was reportedly afflicted with mental issues; so was the Aurora, Colo., shooter, James Holmes. Fully half of respondents - 50 percent - said more mental health access and funding would be 'very effective' at reducing future violence, with an additional 34 percent saying such measures would be 'somewhat effective.' Only 14 percent said they believed more funding would not be effective. Arm the educators Americans also believe that there is far too much violence depicted on television and in video games to which kids are exposed. 47 percent of respondents said reducing depictions of gun violence in movies, on television and in video games would go a long way towards reducing real-life violence; 31 percent said doing so would be 'somewhat effective.' What is especially noteworthy; however, is the number of Americans who believe that arming school personnel would be an effective deterrent; fully 64 percent believe allowing education professionals to be armed would be a 'very effective' or 'somewhat effective' step. It's this latter idea that is catching on in a number of public policy and law enforcement circles. Just days after the Sandy Hook shooting, St. Louis County Police Chief Tom Fitch stated plainly that educators and education professionals should be trained to carry weapons and armed while in school, to protect kids. 'We can talk on the back end of the need for funding of mental illness programs and gun control, but as a law enforcement officer, I'm focused on that five-minute window that it takes for the cops to get there while people are getting killed,' he said. 'There is somebody out there right now trying to figure out how to do something worse than this guy did, and there is only one way to end a threat, and that's with lethal force.' 'We cannot continue to do things as we've always done it, that's why we need to have frank discussion in this country as to where we go from here,' he added. At this point, denial has become our most dangerous enemy Knee-jerk reactionaries; however, quickly dismissed his suggestion and illogical, unworkable, foolish - you name it - but Fitch, a career law enforcement officer, remained undeterred, mostly because he has yet to hear a better idea. 'How do you think we should respond to that?' he said during an interview on local radio station KMOX , regarding the lag time when shots are first fired to when police arrive. 'Nobody has an answer. Nobody has said, 'well, I would do this.' They just say, 'I don't like what you said, it's unacceptable, it's irresponsible, you should be fired.' I've heard all of that. But, nobody has an answer for that critical time period.' He's not alone. Other law enforcement and security experts have similar sentiments. In an excerpt from a compelling article posted online at PoliceOne.com , featuring a hard-hitting presentation on school security by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, the solution is laid bare: The challenge for law enforcement agencies and officers, then, is to overcome not only the attacks taking place in schools, but to first overcome the denial in the minds of mayors, city councils, school administrators, and parents. Grossman said that agencies and officers, although facing an uphill slog against the denial of the general public, must diligently work toward increasing understanding among the sheep that the wolves are coming for their children. Police officers must train and drill with teachers, not only so responding officers are intimately familiar with the facilities, but so that teachers know what they can do in the event of an attack.

0," Many nations formerly of the under-developed Global South, are not about to be bullied by rich Global North countries that have long since existed on the cutting edge of industry and technology and you can count India as one of the largest. In recent days, world leaders and concerned interests gathered in Paris to discuss so-called 'global warming' issues in the latest push to adopt enforceable limits on carbon emissions that are generated primarily through the burning of fossil fuels. India like China, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries is currently in the midst of economic expansions much like the United States and Europe experienced a hundred years ago using much of the same affordable carbon-producing technology that these emerging economies are now relying on. And while the U.S. and Europe have adopted unreasonable and expensive carbon reduction standards which have been based primarily on phony science and manipulated climate data countries like India are not about to surrender their economies just when they are beginning to explode, despite very real health concerns caused by heavy industrialization. 'Carbon imperialism' During the Paris confab, Secretary of State John Kerry even went so far as to single out India as a 'challenge' meaning it would be difficult, at best, to get New Delhi to agree to restrictive new carbon emissions reductions and, from the sound of it, he's right. As the UK Telegraph reported, India indeed has a problem with smog, especially in its large cities, but the country's people and leadership appear to have accepted it as part of the price of modernity and economic growth: It's rush hour in the world's most polluted city, and just visible through the dense blanket of smog is an electronic billboard informing motorists that the air quality has dropped from 'very poor' to 'severe'. If this were Beijing an emergency would be declared, with schools closed for the day and production at factories halted. But here in Delhi, judging by faces barely visible behind anti-pollution masks, nobody seems to have noticed. ... Faced with a rapidly growing population, a buoyant but fragile economy blighted by constant power shortages and millions still living in abject poverty, India argues that it cannot simply decide between renewable and non-renewable power - it needs both. When Kerry singled out India as a 'challenge,' his insult was met with an appropriate mix of anger, frustration and incredulity. 'Kerry's comment is unwarranted and unfair. The attitude of some of the developed countries is the challenge for the Paris conclusion,' said Prakash Javadekar, India's environment minister, The Telegraph reported. He added that his country is 'not in the habit of taking any pressure from anybody.' 'This smacks of a 'carbon imperialism',' Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government's chief economic advisor, also noted. 'And such imperialism on the part of advanced nations could spell disaster for India and other developing countries.' We aren't so good at clean energy policy, either They and others contend that India still burns less coal than the U.S. the world's No. 1 user and China, a rising second and that both have profited from burning carbon-producing fuels for decades (the U.S. for more than a century-and-a-half). But that doesn't mean India is wedded to coal . In fact, as The Telegraph reports further: India has announced efforts to boost renewables too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a 'solar alliance' of 122 solar-rich countries at Paris, seeking to attract $100bn per year global investment in the technology. He has also spoken of the need for new, cleaner methods of coal generation. As for the U.S., our political leadership continually shoots our industries in the foot, even when it comes to so-called 'clean' energy technology. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton designed a huge area in Utah as a federal monument a land mass that just happened to contain a trillion dollars' worth of rare, 'clean' coal . As for the one source of energy that produces a lot of electric power with no emissions nuclear power it is nearly impossible to get a new plant approved, and the regulatory process makes them cost-prohibitive to build. In the meantime, nations like India aren't into the cult of 'global warming,' and are not about to be cowed into giving up the one cheap resource they need to feed and power a nation of 1 billion plus.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The 2008, first quarter report of deaths and serious injuries associated with drug therapy was recently released by The Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit organization whose stated goal is to educate the healthcare community and consumers about safe medication practices. The findings of this report are astounding. According to the information gathered from data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during the first quarter of 2008, there were 20,745 reported serious injuries associated with drug therapy, up 34% from the previous quarter, and up 38% from last year`s average. Even more eye-opening than the number of serious injuries is the number of reported deaths 4,824 people were reported killed from pharmaceutical drugs in the first quarter of 2008, a 2.6 fold increase from the previous quarter. This figure represents the highest number of patient deaths ever reported in a single quarter as a result of drug therapy. It also accounts for more deaths than those due to homicide during the same period. It is important to keep in mind that these figures represent quarterly findings. Given the upward trend in both serious injuries and deaths over the past several years due to pharmaceutical drugs, these numbers are expected to continue their rate of increase in quarters and years to come. Even if the numbers were to remain the same for the rest of 2008, the total number of reported serious injuries would total 83,000 while the total number of reported deaths would reach nearly 20,000. Again, this is assuming the first quarter findings remain constant the report emphasizes that the trend has continued to veer upward, indicating that future reports will most likely contain even higher numbers. What is more striking than these numbers is the fact that they represent only the adverse events that were reported to the FDA during this time period. Since the reporting system is voluntary and almost 85% of the reports come from the pharmaceutical companies themselves, it is obvious that these numbers represent only a miniscule percentage of the total adverse events that are actually occurring. Numerous published scientific reports on adverse event reporting accuracy, including reports from the Journal of the American Medical Association and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have concluded that no more than 10% and in some cases as little as 1-2% of adverse events caused by drugs are even reported to the FDA. Thus, based upon the first quarter data, the actual number of adverse events from drug therapies in the first quarter of 2008 could be anywhere from 207,000 to over 2,000,000 with roughly 23% of these representing deaths. While the report goes on to outline, in detail, most of the culprit drugs , including varenicline, heparin, oxycodone, and even acetaminophen (the active drug in Tylenol), its 'bigger picture' discovery remains blatantly obvious. Assuming a best case scenario of only a 10% reporting rate, this report essentially spells out the fact that at least 830,000 cases of serious injury or death occur every year in America due to the harmful effects of pharmaceutical drugs, with possibly a quarter of these cases resulting in death. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, about 2.5 million people die every year in the United States. Assuming a 10% reporting rate of adverse events to drug therapy based on Q1, 2008 data, it can be concluded that about 8% of the deaths that occur every year in America are due to complications with pharmaceutical drugs. Assuming only a 1% reporting rate, that percentage increases to over 77%. Thus, it can be estimated that the number of people that die every year in the U.S. from adverse drug effects is anywhere from about 192,000 to almost 2,000,000. To put these numbers into perspective, the National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2006, 44,572 people died in car accidents, 18,029 from homicide, and 560,102 from all forms of cancer. It becomes abundantly clear from this report that no one knows for sure exactly how many people are negatively affected by pharmaceutical drugs, but that the number is quite large and is getting increasingly larger. Even on the low end of the estimate spectrum, the data elucidates the obviously prodigious danger of pharmaceutical drugs and the inadequate work being performed by the FDA in protecting the public from dangerous drugs . Considering the scrutiny with which other industries are regulated and controlled by the FDA, it is shocking that, with even a conservative estimate of about 200,000 yearly deaths related to pharmaceutical drugs, the FDA is hardly phased. The agency continues to pander to pharmaceutical interests, including its support for the industry`s immunity from being held accountable for these 'adverse events' under the law. Perhaps as this type of data becomes more mainstream, the public will forcibly hold the drug cabal accountable for the destruction it is inflicting on American society, and the regulatory agencies accountable for turning a blind eye to the damage being perpetrated against the very people it is supposed to be representing and protecting.

0," Jared Diamond is no doom-and-gloomer; he's a Pulitzer Prize winning author of thoughtful, carefully researched books about the rise and fall of societies. Diamond is best known for Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed ( http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Cho... ) and Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies ( http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates... ), both of which are among my top-recommended books of all time. When you read these books, you'll quickly realize that Diamond is perhaps the world's top expert on what might be called the 'holistic, interdependent nature of complex societies.' Rather than limiting his perspective to immediate, short-term actions and consequences (as most national leaders and corporations do), Diamond intelligently examines the long-term, interdependent factors that lead to any society's success or failure. I've personally read both of Diamond's books mentioned above, and they have strongly influenced my own views about the future (or lack thereof) of western civilization. What Diamond and I both agree on is that complex civilizations are quite fragile , and short-terming thinking can easily doom a society or civilization to irreversible collapse. (Another interesting book to read on this subject, although it's quite technical and a bit older, is The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter.) Collapse can come from many vectors. Many collapses are environmental, such as the collapse of the Anasazi Indians in North America or the collapse of the Tiwanaku in South America ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku ). Other causes of collapse include man-made accelerations of environmental change; the classic example being the rampant deforestation of Easter Island by its inhabitants ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#D... ). It is the Easter Island example that perhaps most closely resembles the short-sightedness of modern western civilization . At the expense of future generations, today's CEOs, bankers and politicians are destroying our future in so many ways (financial, chemical, environmental, plundering of fossil fuels, etc.) that it is a challenge to imagine a scenario where western civilization even survives in its current form. Jared Diamond, in fact, has publicly declared he sees only a 51 percent chance of western civilization surviving. You can hear this from his own mouth in this video interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnZgbyiG8wc& Peak Oil and other threats to human civilization This is no casual number-tossing game from a newbie. Jared Diamond has studied the success and failure of world societies more closely than anyone living today. He describes himself as 'cautiously optimistic' but worries that the outlandish financial decisions being made by the world's leaders have put us all in a precarious position from which western civilization may not emerge intact. In my own view, the financial challenges facing our world are, indeed, quite severe. And they may yet bring down the entire global banking system. But in the medium term, I see Peak Oil as being the far greater threat to the continuation of human civilization as we know it. Cheap, plentiful fossil fuels discovered in the last hundred years (or so) spurred a food bubble, which led to a population bubble. Cheap oil , in other words, created the temporary conditions necessary to support a runaway population explosion that is, without question, unsustainable without cheap energy. But cheap oil is finite. And based on all reasonable accounting, world oil production is already in a state of substantial decline. That means oil will become increasingly scarce and expensive with each passing year, precisely as the world's hunger for oil reaches unprecedented heights (cars in China, India, etc.). When the era of cheap oil ends, the food bubble made possible by mechanized agriculture will also end. And that will usher in an era of rapid human depopulation. Long-term, in a post-Peak Oil scenario, most experts expect the planet to only be able to support about one billion people. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Massive depopulation of the human species The current population on the planet is about 6.7 billion people ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_populatio... ). That means we are likely to see a die-off of about 5.7 billion people , or roughly 6 out of every 7 people. A loss of 6 out of 7 people -- even in the long run -- means a great de-specialization of complex societies and a return to a far more agrarian society. There is only ONE nation on Earth that has the experience and culture to handle this transition without much loss of life, and that's Papua New Guinea ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_new_guine... ). Many nations like Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Bolivia and certain Pacific Island nations may also fare well, given that gardening is still a way of life that's taught there (and their climates are especially conducive to easy food production). For everybody else, the transition will be quite devastating. The loss of population density and specialization means a collapse of technology multipliers such as mechanized agriculture, just-in-time manufacturing systems and complex industrial logistics that manufacture and deliver products quickly and cheaply. The long, complex supply lines that characterize modern society will collapse, becoming local. For example, right now fish caught in Canada are shipped to China to be filleted by low-cost laborers, then they are shipped back to Canada to be sold as fish fillets. Such outrageous examples of the wasteful use of energy (and long supply lines) will vanish almost overnight in a post-Peak Oil scenario. Unless some cheap energy supply is quickly discovered that can magically replace oil, virtually all food will eventually become local, which means that anyone living in a region that cannot produce its own food will either starve or leave. Las Vegas, Phoenix and virtually the entire American Southwest will be mostly abandoned by humans. You can expect a mass exodus of people from virtually all cities. Los Angeles would likely become a gang-infested war zone that resembles Somalia more than America. Those who master the skills of agriculture (and who can protect themselves from the desperate masses leaving the cities) will live and reproduce. Those who deny reality and hope for some government to save them with silly economic stimulus bills will starve and die. It is the ultimate application of Darwinian Natural Selection, on a grand and merciless scale. In the end, about 1 out of 7 people will remain. They will be the healthy, resourceful people who are willing to work in order to survive. The masses of medicated, junk-food-eating, entitlement-minded citizens of western nations who insist someone else should save them will be removed from the human gene pool through natural processes. Deniers who foolishly think oil will never run out, or that the global banking system can be saved by printing free money from nothing, or that western civilization will last forever will also be removed from the human gene pool. Can it be prevented? A dire scenario? No more dire than all the previous civilization collapses that have occurred on our planet. The history of human life on Earth is full of arrogant, short-sighted societies that believed they would last forever. Arrogance quickly crumbles into dust in the face of ecological reality (or perhaps in this case, economic reality). Of course, all of this could be prevented if the leaders of modern nations had any real intelligence (defined as having long-term vision and understanding the future implications of present-day decisions). Human life CAN be sustainable on our planet, but only if the people are willing to elect leaders who make decisions today that protect the future instead of selling it out. Such decisions, however, are never popular with the short-sighted people living today. Sadly, there is hardly a single example of a future-minded politician in America today. Rep. Dennis Kucinich may be one of the rare ones on ecological issues, and Rep. Ron Paul is of course right-minded on financial issues. I cannot think of another elected representative (nor any Senator) that has any real long-term view of a sustainable society. Nor do most people think beyond their own paychecks and immediate circumstances. How many people are actually taking great steps to reduce their ecological footprint? How many are investing in nutrition and superfoods for healthy babies? How many are truly growing their own food and solving the problems of seed saving, irrigation, food storage and soil erosion? Remarkably few. Most people in society today live in artificial worlds defined by indoor lighting, air conditioning, processed foods, chemical medicines, artificial wood furniture, television programming and online social networking. None of these have anything to do with reality . Reality is the soil, the rivers, the air, sunlight, plants and seeds. It is found in the animals, microbes, forests and aquatic ecosystems. Reality cannot be negotiated with , nor bargained with, nor put off. Reality is shaped by our decisions and actions, and what we see unfolding in the world right now -- global warming, chemical contamination, depletion of fossil fuels -- is merely a reflection of the destructive actions being mindlessly taken by people living today. It is often said that in a Democracy, people get the government they deserve. On a large scale, this related thought is also true: On our planet, the people get the results they create! And it is this choice that Jared Diamond so graciously reminds us to consider. We have a choice to decide our collective future. Today's decisions create tomorrow's results. There is absolutely no question that the decisions being made right now across the nations of western civilization will create a future world with a greatly reduced capacity for human population. If that is what modern people wish to create, they are right on track with it. But if modern people want to create a different outcome -- a sustainable world that future generations might enjoy without a population collapse and all the suffering that goes with it -- serious changes in behavior are immediately needed in many areas: Economic, ecological, cultural, medicine, agriculture and more. Do not be led to believe that modern civilization is anything more than an erratic blip of temporary insanity on the chart of human history . "
0," At at time when water conservation should be a high priority in drought-plagued California, it would appear that something else has been deemed a high priority: an elitist mind set whereby people self-appoint themselves as an exception to the rule. In the drying up state, this disturbing way of thinking is taking place at the Los Angeles mayoral mansion, Getty House, where it's been reported that approximately 2,100 gallons of water are used per day. You read correctly. Over 2,000 gallons of water is being used at Mayor Eric Garcetti's residence on a daily basis in a state that's in desperate need of the resource. California can't afford excessive, unnecessary water use Indeed, the events unfolding in the state are alarming, causing agricultural, societal and economic balances to unravel quickly. The Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins have been impacted the most; between 2011 and 2014, 4 trillion gallons of water have been lost there every year, more than all 38 million California residents use annually. Reservoir levels continue to fall. Wildfires have spread. Statewide drought emergencies have been declared. Wells are drying up. The problem is of great concern with far-reaching global consequences, especially pertaining to food shortages. While climate change is a factor in the rapid change, groundwater use for agricultural purposes is a significant reason behind the droughts. L.A. Mayor explains why his house uses over five times the amount of water than average L.A. household Still, thousands of gallons of water are used at Getty House - some 5.4 times more than the approximate 390 gallons used daily by the average L.A. household - which Garcetti attributes to public visits that frequently take place inside the building. 'It functions as an event space, a living museum and offices. We happen to live upstairs,' he says, explaining that the water use is not due to the activity of just one or two people. 'We had 4,000-plus people who went through that house just last year alone. Whether a mayor lives there or not, that is a public space. The entire property is not a quote-unquote 'home.'' Still, one has to question the daily consumption, as the reported amount is unfathomable. While the fact that it's a public space is understandable, the amount of faucet use and toilet flushing that must be transpiring there daily still seems absurd. To put it in perspective, the average daily reported water use at Getty House is 5.4 times greater than the roughly 390 gallons used by the average L.A. household. To add irony to the matter, Garcetti has urged residents to cut back on their own water intake, encouraging them to reduce their use by 20 percent over the next few years. 'Our relationship with water must evolve,' Garcetti says. 'We cannot afford the water policies of the past. We must conserve, recycle and rethink how we use our water to save money and make sure that we have enough water to keep L.A. growing.' To reinforce the seriousness behind his message, the Mayor's office will provide L. A. residents with a $100 rebate if they collect rainwater in barrels for the purpose of irrigating gardens and watering plants. Furthermore, it's been reported that Garcetti has personally taken measures to improve water use on his property; turf around the mansion has been replaced with more drought-friendly methods and the irrigation system there has been updated. Still, several people remain bothered by the extreme use of water, calling it unnecessary and extravagant. Is reckless water use by those in power a trend? Perhaps it's a sad trend: his predecessor Antonio Villaraigosa, used three percent MORE water. Technically, therefore, water use in Getty House under Garcetti's leadership is currently reflecting a conservation, albeit a minimal one that hardly makes a dent in addressing California's horrific condition. Is this water use truly a case of need based on the amount of people who pass through a political powerhouse's building? Or are the powers that be indulging in excess, attempting to grasp at a logical excuse that justifies the waste?

0," Biotechnology company AquaBounty has had quite a bit of trouble getting quick regulatory approval for its genetically-modified (GM) salmon, called AquAdvantage, because the 'frankenfish' is not always sterile as claimed and could spread its corrupted genes into the wild. So in order to help move things along, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded the company nearly $500,000 in taxpayer funds to conduct research on how to fully sterilize the fish, according to Grist . Neither the USDA nor the FDA seem to care that the public remains overwhelmingly opposed to AquaBounty's GM salmon regardless of whether or not it is sterile. Not only do consumers not want to eat the fake fish, which has been shown to be highly allergenic, but they also most certainly do not want their hard-earned cash handed over to AquaBounty on a silver platter to ensure that the unwanted salmon eventually makes it to grocery store shelves ( http://www.selfnews.com/GM_salmon.html ). But this is exactly what the USDA has done. While AquaBounty's president and CEO Ronald L. Stotish sneers at those who rightfully oppose his company's intention to force dangerous GM salmon into the food supply against the will of the people, the USDA is busy giving the company the people's money. And eventually, this generous donation may result in AquAdvantage getting full approval, rather than plunging into oblivion as it was on course to do. In other words, American taxpayers are now subsidizing the research and development that AquaBounty itself cannot afford to undertake. The company, after all, has already lost $2.8 million and three board members since its inception, as it has failed to produce a safe product that appeals to, well, anyone. So now the government is artificially propping up the failing company with a cash infusion to ensure that AquAdvantage eventually makes its way to market. The US government, of course, has absolutely no business using taxpayer dollars to fund the development of a GM fish that nobody in the public wants to see released, and definitely does not want to consume. AquaBounty was well on its way to extinction, as it should have been, until the nation's corrupt regulatory bodies decided to intervene and change its course. Commenting on the FDA's potential approval of the GM salmon , regardless of whether or not a sterile version is developed, Colin O'Neil, regulatory policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety, said it best. Grist quotes him as saying that it is 'reckless for the FDA to approve genetically engineered salmon given the large number of environmental, human health, animal welfare and economic risks that have been raised by scientists, members of Congress and members of the FDA's own Advisory Committee.'

0," What do Google, AOL, Skype, Facebook, Apple, Hotmail and Yahoo all have in common? They have all been caught turning over private user data to the government's spy agency, the NSA. All these companies routinely turn over the emails, voice calls, text chats, photos, files and even logins and passwords of their users, including Americans. 'There is a massive apparatus within the United States government that with complete secrecy has been building this enormous structure that has only one goal,' journalist Glenn Greenwald recently told Piers Morgan (who knows all about spying and hacking people's private data). 'And that is to destroy privacy and anonymity not just in the United States but around the world.' Tech companies rush to issue (false) denials Immediately after these revelations surfaced over the past few days, all these companies began denying any involvement with the NSA. 'Google CEO Larry Page and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg are denying reports that depict two of the Internets most influential companies as willing participants in a secret government program that gives the National Security Agency unfettered access to email and other personal information transmitted on various online services,' reports the San Francisco branch of CBS News. But what nobody is yet revealing is that all these companies are required by law to LIE to their own customers about secret government surveillance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , you see, makes it a federal crime for any company participating in the surveillance to publicly acknowledge the existence of that surveillance. Thus, executives at Facebook, Google, Skype and others would all face arrest and federal prosecution as 'terrorists' if they admitted the truth to their own users. That's just how far down the rabbit hole this government surveillance program goes: Not only does the government spy on you and everything you do -- ' they quite literally can watch your ideas as you type ' -- the government can also force all the tech companies cooperating with the spying to publicly deny the existence of the program. But the New York Times -- yes, the NYT which hardly ever engages is actual journalism -- has gone public with an article confirming that these tech companies did, indeed, concede to the NSA surveillance program. 'They opened discussions with national security officials about developing technical methods to more efficiently and securely share the personal data of foreign users in response to lawful government requests. And in some cases, they changed their computer systems to do so,' says the NYT in an article titled Tech Companies Concede to Surveillance Program . Except it wasn't just 'foreign users,' it turns out. The program quickly ballooned to encompass users in the United States, too. The NYT goes on to report: In at least two cases, at Google and Facebook, one of the plans discussed was to build separate, secure portals, like a digital version of the secure physical rooms that have long existed for classified information, in some instances on company servers. Through these online rooms, the government would request data, companies would deposit it and the government would retrieve it, people briefed on the discussions said. This is how companies like Google and Facebook can claim, with a straight face, that the NSA doesn't have 'backdoor access to our servers.' They don't need it! What actually happens is that Google, Facebook, Yahoo and others simply deposit all user data at another location -- a 'gateway' where the NSA copies it off. Now you understand how to correctly parse this fake denial by Google's chief executive Larry Page, who says, 'The U.S. government does not have direct access or a 'back door' to the information stored in our data centers.' It doesn't need 'direct access.' It has INDIRECT access that was set up by Google! Here's the slide from the top secret PRISM program that tells the truth.

How the government flipped the script on 'foreign terrorists' to 'domestic threats' All this is, of course, an outrageous abuse of the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Because when both of those were being debated on the Senate floor following the false flag attacks of 9/11, it was promised that 'this would never be used against Americans.' Hence the name 'Foreign' Intelligence Surveillance Act. It was only about 'foreigners,' because they were the terrorists, right? But over the last decade, the U.S. government flipped the script. All of a sudden the Obama administration was targeting 'domestic threats' which it identified as veterans, patriots, conservatives, gun owners and anyone who believed in the Constitution. It didn't take long for the surveillance grid to be redirected toward the American people. Now, instead of FISA being used to track Bin Laden through a network of caves in Afghanistan, it was being used to track Bob Jones, a Kentucky farmer who owns a shotgun and carries a Bible. This demonstrates just how easily these unconstitutional powers can be abused. History has shown that when the government is granted such powers, they will always turn them against the People sooner or later. Hence the reason for the Fourth Amendment and the entire Bill of Rights -- something that both Bush and Obama seem to think doesn't exist. Anyone who believes the denials of Google and Facebook is a fool At this point, of course, anyone who believes the ridiculous denials of Google and Facebook is an outright fool. Google, for starters, has been run by spooks from the very beginning. Many of its top engineers are straight out of the NSA. Backdoors have been in place from its inception, just FYI. Google allows the government to psychologically profile all its users. By watching what you query in the search engine, they can build a profile of all your interests, habits, perversions and political leanings. Gee, do you think that could be used against you by a vindictive, criminal government that has already been caught using the IRS to intimidate and threaten conservative groups? This is why more and more people are switching over to Startpage: www.StartPage.com It's the 'no surveillance' search engine. Personally, I use Startpage for almost all my searches -- especially when I'm researching something for a story that might get me flagged as a terrorist by the Google / NSA surveillance grid. For example, if I'm researching a story on the Oklahoma City bombing, I might search for something like, 'how to make a fertilizer bomb' just to get background information on the story. Such a search on Google would immediately get you flagged by the NSA as a possible terrorist. That's because journalism has been criminalized under the Obama administration . As an example, examine how the Department of Justice used its power to intimidate and surveil hundreds of Associated Press reporters . It even accused a Fox News reporter of being involved in a conspiracy against America for merely asking a state department official his opinion on an international matter. Collusion between tech companies and bad government Isn't it obvious at this point that the police state spy grid has gotten completely out of control? This collusion between tech companies and abusive government has become a threat to the freedom and safety of the American people. Big Brother isn't merely something that might arrive in the future... it's here! You are being tracked right now. Everything you type, post, say or search for is being recorded and data-mined to psychologically profile you and even predict your future behavior. If we don't stop this, it's only going to become more abusive and dangerous This system is already being wildly abused, yet what we're seeing today is only the beginning. Under a government that strips away the Second Amendment from the People while surveilling all their private communications, no one would be safe from Big Brother . No communications would be private, and anyone who criticized the White House could be arrested and 'disappeared' into Obama's network of secret prisons that he has continued to operate. As a society, we have gone off the cliff and are plummeting toward total tyranny. When privacy is lost, freedom is destroyed. If we cannot hold phone conversations and online conversations in private without being surveiled, tracked and data-mined by our own government, then any idea that America is still the 'land of the free' is a cruel hoax. But Obama says 'trust me!' All this spying is perfectly fine, he claims , because the government is running it and all the government people have been 'fully briefed' on it. Never mind the fact that the People have never been told this is happening! You're supposed to just trust that Obama won't abuse this and that as long as you have nothing to hide, the government won't come knocking on your door one day. Obama is America's sociopath in the White House I'm not the only one who finds this explanation not merely absurd, but wreaking of mental illness . Obama has become America's sociopath. While he vacuums up all your private conversations, phone calls, medical information and personal photographs, he says you're supposed to trust him because he knows 'who the good guys are.' Really? Because it seems increasingly obvious to everyone else that Obama and the entire federal government are the bad guys engaged in outrageous violations of the Bill of Rights on a routine basis. And everything the goes does is rooted in hypocrisy. For example, this is a government that says we can't video tape police on public streets because that's somehow breaking 'wiretapping' laws. And yet, without any warrants whatsoever, this same government can read all your emails, listen to all your phone calls and even track your geographic locations when you initiate those calls. This is all being justified by invoking 'terrorists' that the government itself actually runs! Nearly all the so-called 'terror plots' taking place in the USA today are, in fact, run by the FBI!

0," Research conducted at the Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at George Washington University has found that exposure to the heavy metal cadmium wreaks havoc on cells, making them age faster and, in turn, accelerating the onset of health complications. The study, which was the largest ever to assess the way cadmium impacts parts of DNA which rest on the ends of chromosomes -- called telomeres -- was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology . (1) Telomeres help preserve the functioning of chromosomes, acting as a protective 'barrier' that helps protect the genetic code and, ultimately, helps keep overall health in tact. The longer they are, the more they aid in the process. Shorter ones, however, are an indication that health setbacks are more likely to kick in. While shortening of telomeres is a part of the normal aging process, toxins such as cadmium can render cells unable to divide and, eventually, quicken the development of chronic diseases. (1) Study affirms that even low levels of heavy metals are dangerous 'We looked at heavy metals in this study and found a strong association between exposure to low levels of cadmium and telomere shortening,' said Ami Zota, ScD, MS, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at Milken Institute SPH. 'Our findings suggest that cadmium exposure can cause premature aging of cells. And they add to other evidence indicating this heavy metal can get into the bloodstream and trigger kidney disease and other health problems.' (1) For the study, Zota and her colleagues examined the blood and urine samples taken from over 6,700 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for a few years. The telomere lengths of these participants were measured, followed by a measurement of cadmium in the samples. When the adults were broken up into fourths based on the levels of cadmium discovered in the bloodstream, it was discovered that those in the highest cadmium group had telomeres that were approximately 6 percent shorter than those in the lowest group. (1) 'People with the highest cadmium exposure had cells that looked on average 11 years older than their chronological age,' Zota said, adding that even people in the highest group of exposure still had very tiny amounts of metal in their bloodstream. 'This study adds to evidence suggesting that no level of exposure to this metal is safe.' (1) Sources of cadmium range from contaminated foods to certain children's toys Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal, which the World Health Organization (WHO) considers a 'major public health concern,' linking it with a host of health problems from respiratory issues and cancer to cardiovascular disease. According to Zota, those who are commonly exposed to cadmium usually are ones who inhale tobacco smoke, reside near industrial sites and consume fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated soil. (1) WHO reports that 'Food constitutes the main environmental source of cadmium for non-smokers' and that 'Some crops, such as rice, can accumulate high concentrations of cadmium if grown on cadmium-polluted soil.' (2) Perhaps what comes to mind for many people are the numerous warnings about rice from China. At one time fairly recently, the Food and Drug Administration of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, discovered that 8 out of 18 samples of rice tested from restaurants and canteens had cadmium levels exceeding national limits. (3) Exposure to cadmium involves more than just food, tobacco and industrial site proximity; recent findings have uncovered that it lurks in some popular children's toys. In a report called 'Toxic Tidings,' Senator Jeff Klein (D-Bronx) expressed an increased sense of urgency in passing the Child Safe Products Act. Details of the report, which were made public around the 2014 holiday season, mentioned that common children's toys such as pencil cases decorated with Spongebob Squarepants and Dora the Explorer, as well as a Hello Kitty ring set, tested positive for cadmium and cobalt. In this instance, the findings were mainly discovered at various New York dollar stores.

0," You may recall learning a little bit about medieval English feudalism while in World History class in school. It was a governing system introduced by William I, better known as William the Conqueror, in which he divided up land and gave it to 'nobles' who fought for him and did well in battle. In essence, those who lived on the noble's land were his vassals; in order to survive, they worked the noble's land for a meager living and owed allegiance to him as well. Feudalism has long since disappeared from Europe, but is it on the rebound in the United States? Perhaps, at least in an abbreviated form. Increasingly, because of a historically slow recovery from the economic fiasco of the Great Recession of 2008, more and more Americans have been forced to forego the lifelong dream of owning their own home and instead have been forced to rent. Much of the economic fall-out of the Great Recession came in the form of a collapse in the subprime mortgage industry, in which millions of Americans -- thanks to Clinton-era housing policies -- were permitted to 'buy' homes they simply could not afford. Banks played financial musical chairs with the subprime mortgages, packaging and repackaging them and selling to each other, until there were no buyers left for the worthless notes. The banks were rescued, but Americans were not As noted by McClatchy DC : In 2006 and 2007, Goldman Sachs Group peddled more than $40 billion in securities backed by at least 200,000 risky home mortgages, but never told the buyers it was secretly betting that a sharp drop in U.S. housing prices would send the value of those securities plummeting. In the aftermath, millions of Americans either lost homes or saw the homes they owned severely devalued, a condition that, in some parts of the country, continues to this day. As for the big banks that were forced to make the loans (remember, this was government policy), they got a bailout under the auspices that, if they did not, the global economy would collapse as well, leading to a massive recession. The result was that banks' bottom lines improved while Americans' bottom lines did not or, at least, not nearly as quickly, and not at all to the extent of the banks. And the housing market is still feeling the effects. As reported by the blog Wolf Street : The housing market has been healed by the Fed's bold actions, we're told incessantly. ... Prices have soared over the last three years, and in some cities, like San Francisco, they have soared far beyond the prior crazy bubble peak. So we admit grudgingly that the Fed's six-year money-printing and interest-rate-repression campaign, designed to inflate every asset price in sight even to absurdity, has worked. However, an essential element in a healthy housing market -- people who actually live in homes they own -- has been dissipating. The homeownership rate peaked in 2004 at 69.2%. It was during the prior housing bubble. Speculative buying drove up prices beyond the reach of many potential buyers. The American dream is collapsing Others note that the collapse of the American dream of homeownership is proceeding apace. According to the U.S. Census Bureau , [PDF] homeownership in the U.S. stood at 64 percent last year, a figure that was 1.2 percent lower than the previous year, the largest annual drop in the history of the data series going back to 1980. Younger households were hit the hardest, analysts noted. In the age group of homeowners under 35, the ownership rate plunged 1. 5 percent to 35.4 percent; for ages 35-44, the rate dropped even further, 2.1 percent -- and all in a single year -- to settle at 58.8 percent. These age groups are normally targeted as first-time home buyers. Will feudalism return to the United States? Maybe not quite in the same form as it existed in medieval Europe, but a form of it seems to be increasingly prevalent as more Americans are shut out of owning their own property and must instead exist dependent on the property of others.

0," With all the recent talk in the nation's capital and in some statehouses around the country about efforts to implement new gun control measures, it might seem like law-abiding gun owners don't have too many friends. That couldn't be further from the truth. Most Americans who support and exercise their right to keep and bear arms are well aware of the National Rifle Association and its exemplary efforts, today and in previous years, to defend gun owners. But the NRA isn't the only show in town. Meet the Second Amendment Foundation There is another organization called the Second Amendment Foundation that has a stellar history of defending your constitutional right to armed self-defense, and in fact, the organization has recently helped score a major legal victory for the right to keep and bear - and carry - arms in the state of Illinois. According to a press release, the group was involved in a lawsuit before the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down an Illinois law preventing concealed carry of a weapon outside the home. Writing for the three-judge panel, U.S. District Judge Richard Posner said the right to self-defense is 'broader than the right to have a gun in one's home.' Furthermore, the panel's ruling gives the Illinois legislature 180 days to 'craft a new gun law that will impose reasonable limitations, consistent with the public safety and the Second Amendment ...on the carrying of guns in public.' 'This is a victory for Illinois citizens who have been long denied a right recognized in the other 49 states; to have the means necessary for self-defense outside the home,' said SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. 'In the broader sense,' he added, 'this ruling affirms that the right to keep and bear arms, itself, extends beyond the boundary of one's front door. This is a huge victory for the Second Amendment.' The SAF represented Illinois resident Michael Moore and others in a case filed against Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan. The case, Moore v. Madigan, was combined with a separate case involving church worker Mary Shepard, who was attacked along with an elderly co-worker by a much larger man. The SAF is involved in additional litigation in an attempt to support and defend the constitutional amendment which is its namesake, but there is much more the organization does. As the nation's oldest, largest tax-exempt group of its kind, SAF also serves as an educational, research and publishing resource. Using education, outreach to protect your right to keep and bear arms 'Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 650,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control,' says the organization. The group's mission statement says it all: 'The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) is dedicated to promoting a better understanding about our Constitutional heritage to privately own and possess firearms . To that end, we carry on many educational and legal action programs designed to better inform the public about the gun control debate.' One way SAF does that is through community outreach. Each year, the organization sponsors a Gun Rights Policy Conference , featuring gun rights leaders and activists from around the country. The 28th annual event this year is scheduled to be held in Houston, September 27-29. 'This year we'll take a look at critical issues such as: bans on semi-auto guns and magazines, 'smart' guns, concealed carry, federal legislation, BATFE policies, gun show regulation, state and local activity and the most recent Right to Keep and Bear Arms court cases,' says an informational webpage describing this year's conference agenda.

0," A new report says that the number of illegal aliens currently residing in the United States has surpassed the number of unemployed Americans looking for work, a statistic that is bound to become a factor in the 2016 presidential race. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon , new data from the Pew Research Center found that there were approximately 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. in 2014, compared to 9.6 million American citizens who were unemployed in the same year. The Pew report, which utilized data from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, notes: An estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2014. The new unauthorized immigrant total includes people who cross the border illegally as well as those who arrive with legal visas and remain in the U.S. after their visas expire. Of the 11.3 million illegals, 8.1 million are currently participating in the labor force. 'Unauthorized immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force,' said the Pew report . 'In the U.S. labor force, there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in 2012.' Read more about unemployment in America at unemployment.fetch.news Issue will be a priority for many Americans in 2016 By 2014, the report states, 1.7 million more illegal immigrants were living in the country than there were jobless Americans. The BLS data indicate that the average number of unemployed Americans in 2014 was 9.6 million; the agency defines an unemployed person as someone who was without a job but who was actively searching for one in the previous four weeks. The WFB noted that President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigrants, which critics say amounted to an unconstitutional executive amnesty, that he enacted in November of 2014 will ultimately result in more illegal aliens becoming active in the U.S. labor force. 'Last year, President Barack Obama took executive action to expand an existing program and establish a new one that would offer work permits and deportation relief to an estimated 5 million unauthorized immigrants ,' the Pew report stated. 'The actionswhich are on hold because of a lawsuit by 26 stateswould be open to unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who are parents with a child who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, as long as they meet certain requirements.' The Pew report noted that illegal immigration to the U.S. exploded between 1990, when there were about 3.5 million inside the country, and 2007, when the figure grew to more than 12 million. But the employment disparity is certain to garner attention, not only among the American electorate, but also from presidential candidates, some of whom have already made headlines criticizing Obama's immigration policies. 'You can't be talking about anything else' Billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump was the first to really broach the subject in a manner than rankled the political elite but nevertheless struck a chord with average Americans, judging by his meteoric rise to the top of Republican polls. When he launched his bid in July, Trump emphatically stated that a large number of aliens crossing illegally into the U.S. were criminals specifically 'rapists' and 'murderers' and that Mexico was not sending its best citizens. Less than a week after making his controversial comments, 32-year-old Kate Steinle of San Francisco was killed by a 45-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who had been deported five times and recently released from custody by San Francisco officials. Since then, Trump has elevated the topic of 'sanctuary cities' like San Francisco to the fore, calling such local policies dangerous and caused by an 'unsafe border.' Another top Republican candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, has made standing up for American workers versus those who are in the country illegally part of his campaign. 'You can't be talking about anything else until you do that,' Walker said during a recent appearance on Fox News ' 'Hannity' program.

0," As research continues to confirm the deadly effects of sitting for long periods of time, savvy workers are switching to standing desks and reaping the benefits. Notable advocates of tall work stations include Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill and Ernest Hemingway, among others. All sensed the inherent reward of increased creativity, alertness and physical stamina. What they may not have known is that standing desks can save lives. Health perils of sitting Linked with an increased likelihood of heart disease, inflammation, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer, lengthy periods of sitting are bad news for health. According to the selfnews article, 'More evidence suggest that desk jobs and excessive sitting are deadly,' researchers at Leicester University in the U.K discovered: '... the longer a person sits each day, the more likely he or she is to develop markers of metabolic syndrome, which include high levels of both glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream. As it turns out, an individual's metabolic rate, which represents the amount of energy expended while at rest, also plummets while sitting, which in the absence of proper exercise can lead to being overweight or obese.' Additionally, the Mayo Clinic states: 'From previous studies we also know that a sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers (breast and colon).' Thankfully, we need not succumb to such dire consequences of a sedentary life. When we take a stand for health, we can fend off disease while encouraging better focus, productivity, energy and zest. Not to mention a svelte waistline. Stand-up and thrive Instead of slouching over your computer for hours on end, consider a standing desk. Used by great minds throughout history, standing upright while working burns calories, increases blood flow, reduces neck strain and keeps us healthy. Steve Connor notes in The Independent : 'Scientists have found that a person's metabolic rate crashes to a minimum when sitting and that standing up for an extra three hours a day, even without exercising, would on average burn off about 3.6kg of fat a year.' And Chris Adams in 'The Benefits of a Standing Desk,' observes: 'Another benefit of a standing desk is an increase in your focus, alertness and activity level. These all support each other. When standing it is easier to release restless energy. Combine that with the good circulation, stable blood sugar and an active metabolism and it is easier to focus on the task at hand. Many authors and statesmen throughout the centuries who swear by working at a standing desk have claimed that it helps get the creative juices flowing. It also fights fatigue and improves tiredness.' If you are sold on the idea, here are a few tips to keep in mind: - Place the computer screen at eye level to avoid neck strain - Arms should be kept at a 90 degree angle - Stand straight with feet shoulder width apart Also, do not purely stand throughout your work day as this increases the risk of carotid atherosclerosis along with varicose veins. Gentle movements such as shifting weight from one foot to the other as well as an anti-fatigue mat are helpful to keep leg circulation humming. "
0," With the poor quality of many of today's conventional meat products, a vegetarian diet just might be an appropriate fit for some modern children, one of three that are now overweight in the US. A new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that people of all ages, including children, that adhere to a vegetarian diet generally have lower average body mass indexes (BMI) than others, and are generally leaner than their meat-eating counterparts. The report explains that obesity is less prevalent among vegetarians, and that average BMI increases progressively higher depending on how much meat a person eats. Vegans, for instance, generally have the lowest BMI, while vegetarians that eat dairy and eggs have a slightly higher average BMI. Meat eaters, suggest study authors, have the highest average BMI of all. Besides simply the visible weight benefits, adhering to a vegetarian diet may also improve lipid profile, say the authors, which means that a person is less likely to experience coronary heart disease. This means that vegetarians may have a lowered risk of developing high cholesterol, or having a heart attack or stroke. Because a plant-based diet can contain far more nutrients, complex carbohydrates, fiber, and water, than a meat-based diet, it is more likely to promote lean body mass rather than added fat, says the team. The extra fiber found in plant-based diets also contributes to making a person feel 'full' more quickly than a meat-based diet would, which results in less food being eaten. '[O]besity represents a significant threat to the present and future health of children and leads to a wide range of physical and psychological consequences,' write the study authors. '(A) plant-based diet appears to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity in children.' The report does not, however, differentiate between meat-based diets that include pastured meats, and meat-based diets that include conventional, feedlot-derived meats. The two differ greatly, as pastured meat contain higher levels of beneficial nutrients than does conventional meat, and is also higher in healthy fats and amino acids like omega-3s ( http://www.selfnews.com/027199_meat_fat_c... ). Also, when choosing a vegetarian diet , it is important to carefully select foods, especially when children are involved, that contain a full profile of necessary vitamins and minerals. Some vegetarian diets lack crucial nutrients like B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc, iron, and calcium, as well as protein, which is essential for the growth and development of healthy muscle mass.

0," Tweet Like September 11, 2001, the 2005 terrorist attacks in London once again reminded the Western hemisphere that even the countries that wield tremendous military power are not immune to terrorism. Though the London attacks did not involve nuclear weapons, there is always the chance that future terrorist attacks will. There is also the chance that a nuclear disaster like Chernobyl might occur. For those reasons, in November 2004, News Target reminded readers that they should always have some potassium iodide tablets on hand, just in case. However, even though potassium iodide is a necessary measure in the event of a nuclear emergency, there may be some risks associated with taking it and, as is always the case with a drug or supplement, you should make yourself aware of these risks before you take potassium iodide. Three months after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the FDA released its Guidance on Potassium Iodide (KI) as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies, which was designed to prescribe other federal agencies' and also local governments' use of potassium iodide 'in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment.' According to the FDA, potassium iodide's ability to protect against radioactively-induced cancer is 'well-established.' The FDA goes on to explain, 'When administered in the recommended dose, KI is effective in reducing the risk of thyroid cancer in individuals or populations at risk for inhalation or ingestion of radioiodines. KI floods the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine and prevents the uptake of the radioactive molecules, which are subsequently excreted in the urine.' In other words, potassium iodide occupies the thyroid gland with 'good' iodine, so that it will be too busy to absorb cancer-causing, radioactive iodine. However, as the FDA states, in order for it to be most effective, you must take the right dose of potassium iodide for your age and level of toxic exposure, within three to four hours of exposure and daily until the exposure is over. Given the way that potassium iodine works to prevent the thyroid gland from absorbing radioactive iodine, it is obvious that the use of it could potentially cause some negative thyroid effects. In his Complete Guide to Health and Nutrition, Gary Null warns for all potassium iodide users 'to be aware that, if you suddenly deluge your perfectly normal thyroid gland with large amounts of supplementary iodine, you can inhibit its ability to produce thyroxine.' Thyroid damage from potassium iodide use is unfortunately most common in the elderly. If an elderly person has thyroidal goiter, potassium iodide can cause hyperthyroidism, according to PDR for Nutritional Supplements authors Sheldon Saul Hendle and David Rorvik. In fact, the FDA advises that 'anyone over 40 should be treated with KI only if the predicted exposure is high enough to destroy the thyroid and induce lifelong hypothyroidism (thyroid deficiency).' As with any substance, someone who has never taken potassium iodide before may suddenly develop an allergic reaction. Usually an allergic response to potassium iodide affects the skin the most, taking the form of rashes or acne, reports to Dr. Elson M. Haas. According to an American Cancer Society statement that Professor Ralph W. Moss calls 'outdated,' excessive use of potassium iodide, even without allergy, may cause pimples, swelling of the glands similar to mumps, runny eyes and nose and impotence. However, in his fairly recent book, Health and Nutrition Secrets, Dr. Russell L. Blaylock echoes the 'outdated' American Cancer Society statement: 'Higher doses in both adults and babies can cause a greater number of side effects and offers no further protection. In general, the side effects are mild and include swelling of the salivary glands, a metallic taste in the mouth, sore teeth and gums, gastrointestinal upset and/or skin rashes.' Though these potential side effects, in my opinion, should not be enough to dissuade you from taking potassium iodide in the event of a nuclear emergency, they should be enough to warn you not to 'overdose' yourself on potassium iodide. On the other hand, there has also been a historical association between potassium iodide and cancer, the very disease that it is supposed to prevent. In the famous case involving anti-cancer tonic creator Harry Hoxsey, a number of cancer specialists testified that potassium iodide, which was one of the ingredients in Hoxsey's mixture, might actually speed up the growth of cancerous tumors. However, many other researchers deny the link between potassium iodide and faster tumor growth. The Hoxsey case and the beliefs expressed in it have been a source of controversy since the initial popularity of Hoxsey's treatment. Now, in light of recent terrorist attacks on the world and the possibility of attack with radioactive weapons, individual local governments, federal agencies and the medical community as a whole have no choice but to seriously rethink their former opinions on potassium iodide and once again weigh the risks and benefits. The experts speak on potassium iodide and its effects: 'Potassium iodide and possible nuclear attacks or disasters' If you leave the fate of your own health up to a bunch of state bureaucrats, you're a fool. Everybody needs to have some potassium iodide on hand to protect themselves from radiation poisoning caused by nuclear accidents or nuclear terrorism. I've been recommending this since 1997, and finally, the feds starting promoting the idea after 9/11. But many states refuse to protect their own citizens. Their plans? 'We'll evacuate everybody in time.' Sure they will. And my dog can play the piano. 'Some states refuse to distribute potassium iodide, leaving residents vulnerable to nuclear accidents' KI works best if used within 3 - 4 hours of exposure. 'Frequently Asked Questions on Potassium Iodide' by the FDA 'How potassium iodide works against the effects of a nuclear attack' In December 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final 'Guidance on Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies.' The objective of the document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of the recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies. The recommendations in the guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used. This guidance updates FDAs 1982 recommendations. 'Frequently Asked Questions on Potassium Iodide' by the FDA Less iodine is lost from organically bound sources (as in foods such as kelp) because your body absorbs it better than it does iodine in potassium iodide supplements. There have been no documented cases of iodine poisoning. However, be aware that if you suddenly deluge your perfectly normal thyroid gland with large amounts of supplementary iodine, you can inhibit its ability to produce thyroxine. Complete Guide Health Nutrition by Gary Null, page 410 1. What does potassium iodide (KI) do? The effectiveness of KI as a specific blocker of thyroid radioiodine uptake is well established. When administered in the recommended dose, KI is effective in reducing the risk of thyroid cancer in individuals or populations at risk for inhalation or ingestion of radioiodines. KI floods the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine and prevents the uptake of the radioactive molecules, which are subsequently excreted in the urine. 2. Can potassium iodide (KI) be used to protect against radiation from bombs other than radioactive iodine? Potassium iodide ( KI) works only to prevent the thyroid from uptaking radioactive iodine. It is not a general radioprotective agent. 6. What dosages of potassium iodide (KI) should be taken for specific exposure levels? Exposures greater than 5 cGy: Birth through 2 mos. - 16 mg. 1 mo. through 3 yrs. - 32 mg. 3 yrs through 18 yrs. - 65 mg. (Adolescents>150 pounds should take adult dose.) Exposures greater than 10 cGy: 18 yrs through 40 yrs. - 130 mg Exposures greater than 500 cGy: Adults over 40 yrs - 130 mg. 'Frequently Asked Questions on Potassium Iodide' by the FDA Older people with nodular goiters are at risk of developing hyperthyroidism from use of potassium iodide and iodized salt. Potassium iodide and iodized salt may exacerbate symptoms in some with autoimmune thyroiditis. PDR for Nutritional Supplements by Sheldon Saul Hendle and David Rorvik, page 570 Finally, anyone over 40 should be treated with KI only if the predicted exposure is high enough to destroy the thyroid and induce lifelong hypothyroidism (thyroid deficiency). 'Frequently Asked Questions on Potassium Iodide' by the FDA 'Skin disorders and other problems possibly associated with potassium iodide' Excessive quantities of iodized salt, taking too many kelp tablets, or overuse of potassium iodide expectorants such as SSKI can cause some problems, but regular elevated intake of iodine is needed to produce toxicity. Some people have allergic reactions, mainly as skin rashes, to iodine products. Iodine supplementation may also worsen acne in some cases.. Staying Healthy With Nutrition by Elson M Haas MD, page 196 Since potassium iodide can cause a burning sensation in the mouth, either the tablet should be crushed and fully dissolved in a volume of orange juice that the baby can consume quickly, or you should use a saturated solution dissolved in orange juiceHigher doses in both adults and babies can cause a greater number of side effects and offers no further protection. In general, the side effects are mild and include swelling of the salivary glands, a metallic taste in the mouth, sore teeth and gums, gastrointestinal upset and/or skin rashes.

0," Tweet 412 BC Major epidemic of a disease (which, although not called influenza, probably was influenza) recorded by Hippocrates. 1357 AD The term, influenza, from the Italian word meaning 'influence,' was coined. Popular belief at that time blamed the development of flu on the influence of the stars. 1485 'Sweating sickness,' a flu-like malady, sickens hundreds of thousands of people in Britain. The Lord Mayor of London, his successor and six aldermen die. The Royal Navy cannot leave port due to the sickness of sailors. Doctors prescribe tobacco juice, lime juice, emetics, cathartics and bleeding as treatments for the disease. 1580 First recorded influenza pandemic begins in Europe and spreads to Asia and Africa. 1700s Influenza pandemics in 1729-1730, 1732-1733, 1781-1782. 1781 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1830 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1831, 1833-1834 Influenza pandemics hit. 1847-1848 Influenza sweeps through the Mediterranean to southern France and then continues across in Western Europe. 1878 A disease causing high mortality in poultry becomes known as the 'fowl plague.' Fowl plague is now called HPAI avian influenza. 1889-1890 The 'Russian flu' spreads through Europe and reaches North America in 1890. 1900 Major epidemic. 1918-1919 The 'Spanish Flu' circles the globe (though some experts think it may have started in the U.S.). Caused by an H1N1 flu virus, it is the worst influenza pandemic (and subsequently, epidemic) to date. There are more than half a million U.S. deaths; worldwide death estimates range from 20 million to 100 million. According to WebMD, 'The pandemic comes before the era of antibiotics -- which are now essential in treating the secondary bacterial infections that often kill flu-weakened patients -- so it's difficult to say whether this flu would have the same dreadful impact in the modern world. But it is a very frightening disease, with very high death rates among young, previously healthy adults.' 1924 The first outbreak of HPAI avian influenza -- bird flu -- in the U.S. It does not spread among humans. Late 1920s Richard Shope shows that swine influenza can be transmitted through filtered mucous, implying that influenza is caused by a virus. 1933 Sir Christopher Andrewes, Wilson Smith and Sir Patrick Laidlaw isolate the first human influenza virus. 1940 Frank Macfarlane Burnet grows influenza on a laboratory growth system (embryonated chicken eggs). 1941 George K. Hirst discovers that influenza causes hemagglutination of red blood cells, thus providing a new method of assaying for the virus 1955 Sir Christopher Andrewes, along with Burnet and Bang, coins the term 'myxovirus' for the influenza family. 1957-1958 The 'Asian Flu' causes the second pandemic of the 20th century. Caused by an H2N2 virus, it begins in China and kills one million people worldwide, including 70,000 Americans. 1968-1969 The 'Hong Kong Flu' causes the last flu pandemic. It was caused by an H3N2 virus and killed some 34,000 Americans. The relatively low death toll is thought to have been due to two factors. First, the virus contained the N2 protein humans had been exposed to before. Second, an H3 virus circulated around the turn of the century, giving some immune protection to elderly people who had caught the flu back then. Mid-1970s Researchers realize that enormous pools of influenza virus continuously circulate in wild birds. 1976 Swine flu breaks out among a handful of soldiers stationed at Fort Dix, N.J. One dies. It's an H1N1 virus, and health officials worry that they are seeing the return of the 1918 H1N1 Spanish Flu pandemic. As the virus is circulating among U.S. pigs, President Gerald Ford calls for a crash vaccination program. Despite delays, a vaccine is made and a quarter of the U.S. population is inoculated. There were 25 deaths from a rare paralytic complication of the vaccination (Guillain-Barre syndrome). Nobody else died of swine flu, which never caused an epidemic. 1977 Mild Russian influenza epidemic occurs. 1983 The second HPAI outbreak occurs in the U.S. Caused by an H5N2 virus, it does not spread among humans. However, this severe poultry epidemic strikes chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl in Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is finally brought under control after the destruction of 17 million birds. 1988 Wiley, Wilson and Skehel determine the location of the antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin molecule by X-ray crystallography. 1996 HPAI H5N1 bird flu is isolated from a farmed goose in Guangdong, China. May 1997 The first person known to catch H5N1 bird flu dies in Hong Kong. The virus has been causing an epidemic among poultry in the city. November-December 1997 There are 18 new human cases of H5N1 bird flu in Hong Kong, 12 with direct contact with infected poultry. Six people die. Officials destroy 1.4 million chickens and ducks. Jan. 5, 2003 Health authorities in Vietnam inform the WHO office in Hanoi of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 11 previously healthy children hospitalized in Hanoi, with the most recent hospital admission on Jan. 4. Seven cases were fatal and two patients remain critically ill. A 12th case, a sibling of one of the Hanoi cases, died of a respiratory illness in a provincial hospital. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The 'new biology' is challenging many long-held beliefs that affect us in the areas of psychology, physiology, and spirituality. As the quote below indicates, mind-over-matter was an idea advocated by Kabbalists of the 18th century, but it came to be regarded as a fantasy, a theory that received very negative reviews in 'modern' times. Once DNA was discovered, genetic paradigms gained influence over every phase of our lives. When a large number of illnesses and disorders were blamed on genes inherited from parents, it provided an excuse for our distress. 'The basic cause of illness is unhappiness; therefore the great healer is joy.'(Rabbi Nachman, late 18th century) There was a time recently when many doctors would imply to their patients that their illness was all in their heads. Patients did not like this, as it put the responsibility for maintaining health on the person's own shoulders. Many thought their doctor said this only because he or she could not figure out the source of symptoms. Now, however, science is making strides in brain studies which are providing proof that our thoughts can indeed affect our brain chemistry and thus our physical and mental health. We have learned that negative emotions such as fear and stress not only make our bodies more susceptible to disease, but can actually cause the disease. Conversely, the same biochemical mechanisms that work against us may also be utilized to work for us. The placebo effect has been shown to heal a fair percentage of patients whose belief in the cure was enough to actually rid their bodies of disease. This effect works by the power of suggestion; patients have believed they had surgeries for cancer when they have not had any and the cancer cleared up, or they have been given sugar pills that cured them. The new biology takes this further. It is not just the power of suggestion, but the actual thoughts and words chosen by the person which changes brain chemistry. We have 50 trillion cells in our body which communicate through neurochemical and vibration signals. Bruce H. Lipton, PhD, has done a large amount of work in this field, which is called epigenetics. The word epigenetics literally means 'above the genes', i.e., the mind controls the genes. Dr. Lipton says our minds can re-write our genes. He compares the cell to a computer chip, as each is a bit of information. Both can receive information through different routes and cause a reaction. Epigenetics changes our paradigm of control. The old physics believed the universe is based on matter. The new biology is based on the idea that the universe is governed by energy. Even though the programming of the cells begins in infancy or before birth, they can be reprogrammed to act differently. The process which the information goes through to affect the cell determines the programming of the cell. Cells become cancerous because they are instructed in some way to do so. If we realize this and change our beliefs, thus changing our messages to our cells, Lipton says we can heal ourselves. With genes off the hook as the cause of cancer, for example, people won't have the negative worries and thoughts about cancer that plague them just because their mom, dad or other relative had it. This in itself should eliminate a large number of incidences of cancer. However, this is still not all of the power of the new biology. The main chemicals which play a role in our brain chemistry are Dopamine, Serotonin, Norepinephrine and Endorphins. Each of these affects a different area. Most recreational runners know the endorphin effect, or runner's high. Messages sent to the brain tell it to produce more or less of a certain chemical, depending on what the body needs at the time. These messages can be stimulated by bodily processes which tell our mind what we need, or mental processes by which our thoughts originate the signaling message. It is the thought-as-originator concept which is harder for people to understand. Consider these examples: "
0," Since ancient times human beings have looked for superior medicines. Superior medicines come right out of the earth itself, miraculously. They bring the very regenerative essences, energies and emotions of nature directly into the body. Their qualities are organized in such a way that they restore balance quickly and effectively. They confer the virtues of nature directly and safely. The berberine rich plants that grow on the earth are superior medicines. They are as close to healing gold, as I have found, certainly. You can see the bright gold color of the berberine glowing in the roots and rhizomes of these special plants. This is the bright yellow glow of nature's pure anti inflammatory action. This bright yellow glowing active ingredient was used by ancient doctors to cure infections long before the first penicillin mold was plucked out of a petrie dish. Berberine effectively restores serum blood sugar balance. Berberine herbs purify heat toxins from the blood, their cold energetics addressing infection and inflammation, while their astringent qualities recondition the mucous membranes that line and protect our vital organs. This makes them particularly suited to regenerating both the upper and lower digestive tracts. Modern research is just beginning to observe their powerful healing effect on malignant cells. Their strong diuretic effect makes them particularly suited for imbalances of the bladder and urinary tract since they deliver an abundant supply of active ingredients to those areas of the body. Ancient oriental doctors knew how to combine the cold berberine herbs with more warming spleen supporting plants. This allowed them to sustain powerful berberine healing regimes for extended periods of time, because the central and root life fire was protected from the cold. They could deliver rapid healing in acute conditions and regenerate wasting disease when the medicines were used over time. The warm months of summer was the traditional time to use the powerful berberine herbs to do deep inflammation, bacterial, and fungal clearing regimes but they could, when properly blended, be used to good effect at anytime. There are many good berberine supplements now on the market. Natures Way and Herb Pharm offer good berberine rich supplements. The berberine is sourced from goldenseal, goldenthread, and barberry for the most part. They are indicated for infections, ulcers, colitis, type two diabetes, heart regeneration and for cancer treatment and prevention. One can either use a berberine supplement or the raw herbs can be purchased and prepared as a decoction, tincture or used in a powdered form. Traditional Botanical Medicine's Phyto Gold Formula combines powerful berberine herbs with spleen supporting ingredients which allows most people to use them for weeks at a time. http://traditionalbotanicalmedicine.com/products/ The following Sources are taken from the vast body of modern berberine research: http://defeatosteosarcoma.org http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22483555#%23 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474499#%23 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20828602#%23 About the author: Angelo Druda practices oriental medicine in Cobb, California.

0," It's been a long time coming and, with the opposition party controlling both the Senate and Executive Branch, there is no guarantee of success, but one congressman is vowing to shutter the abusive Transportation Security Administration and allow airports the right to hire their own customer-friendly private security. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., head of an Oversight and Government Reform Committee sub-panel, has been perhaps the most consistent critic of the TSA. In addition to speaking out against some of the agency's outrageous screening practices, he has also lobbied airports to ditch the agency in lieu of private screeners. Now, he's prepared to take his crusade a step further: He wants to disband the TSA altogether. Mica says he will soon introduce legislation returning all airport security authority to private firms. In addition, he has stated he is determined to push for up to six hearings this year along to get the bill crafted and to the House floor. What's more, he believes ditching the agency is - or should be - a bipartisan effort. 'I'm telling you, whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or if there are a few independents left, people have had it right up to their eyebrows with TSA,' Mica told Bloomberg News . 'It's not a partisan issue.' Looking for a little payback? Admittedly, Mica wrote the legislation establishing the TSA in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but has regretted doing so ever since. He has proclaimed the agency a miserable failure, especially in the past few years. And more recently, the head of the agency, John Pistole, angered Mica even further when he refused to appear before the Florida lawmaker's committee, arrogantly proclaiming at the time that the panel has 'no jurisdiction over the TSA .' That was then. The panel Mica now chairs does have jurisdiction over the agency, as well as subpoena power (a power his previous panel lacked), and agency officials have no recourse but to appear if or when the panel requires them to do so. 'I have clear jurisdiction, investigative jurisdiction with subpoena power,' Mica said. 'I intend to use whatever it takes to get answers to try and change the agency.' Mica said his legislative effort has 'strong momentum,' and he adds that if passed the measure would return airport screening duties to private companies within two years. TSA 'should not be conducting the screening,' he said. 'They should be setting the standards, conducting the oversight. TSA should be a security and intelligence agency.' Mica's concept is not radical. Already there are 16 airports using private security companies under the Screening Partnership Program (SPP), and more are considering joining after years of TSA abuses - many of which have been captured on video and have gone viral - as well as passenger complaints. 'It's critical that TSA get out of the business of running a huge bureaucracy and human resources operation and refocus its attention on security, analyzing intelligence, and setting the highest risk-based security standards,' Mica - who has written to hundreds of airports encouraging them to opt for private security - has said. 'TSA needs to focus on going after terrorists - not little old ladies, veterans and children.' Mica has said. It won't be smooth sailing, but... Unfortunately, there are other obstacles to the passage of Mica's bill, if or when it reaches the House floor. A recent Government Accountability Office report, issued in December, noted there was 'insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions of improved performance of SPP...when compared to federal screening services' (though I would point out that no videos of outrageous behavior committed by SPP participants have been posted or have gone viral). That conclusion led Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security committee, to advise the TSA to stop accepting additional SPP applications from airports until further study can be done - a move which has already led to some airports backing away from considering joining the SPP. Nevertheless, Mica says he will call his first hearing in April to look at the TSA's dubious claim that sequester-forced spending cuts are going to cause longer delays in airports - though the agency just signed a $50 million contract to purchase new uniforms and is continuing to by unreliable but expensive body scanners.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) U.S. newspaper publishers are shifting their focus away from print subscribers and toward the Internet as print advertising revenue continues to fall, according to presentations made at the annual Mid-Year Media Review, hosted by the Newspaper Association of America . 'The Internet is no longer an add-on,' said Reid Ashe, chief operating officer of Media General. 'For many applications such as breaking news or increasingly, classified advertising, it's now our primary medium.' Media General owns three metropolitan newspapers -- including the Tampa Tribune and Richmond Times Dispatch -- 22 daily community newspapers, 23 network-affiliated television stations and more than 150 other publications, such as weekly papers. In addition to these media outlets, Media General owns 75 affiliated online enterprises. Media General announced that it expects the profit from its print outlets to be lower in 2007 than 2006; the company's May revenues were 15% lower than its revenues from the same month last year. In contrast, it expects online revenue of $40 million for 2007, and $50 million for 2008. Belo Chairman and CEO Robert W. Decherd announced the Dallas Morning News will reduce its distribution to within 100 miles of Dallas/Fort Worth, in order to save $9 million per year, and that it is planning other circulation cutting measures as well. 'In actively marketing our products, the emphasis should be on attracting quality subscribers rather than seeking quantity at any cost,' Decherd said. 'Instead of focusing on short-term performance, our goal over time is to deliver a stable audience with a demographic profile that is very attractive to advertisers -- and do so in the most cost effective way possible.' However, the Internet may not be as much of a salvation as many have thought. While newspapers' online advertising revenue continues to grow, this growth has slowed -- 20 percent this year, compared to 30 or 35 percent a few years ago. According to the media news site followthemedia.com, this growth is not fast enough to offset declining print revenue. "
0," All the celebrities and sports figures who participate in the 'Got Milk' ad campaigns are actually showing their faces smeared with pus cells, reveals a startling new Food Investigations video produced by the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center ( www.FoodInvestigations.com ). Narrated by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, the video reveals little-known documentation from the dairy industry that proves the industry allows up to 750,000 pus cells per ml of pasteurized milk. This means that an 8-ounce of glass of conventional pasteurized milk may contain up to 180 million pus cells . The short video is viewable at: http://tv.selfnews.com/v.asp?v=C463AA940B... Or on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKTfkFIiQUw PUS -- or 'somatic cells' -- are the result of infection in dairy cows. These infections are caused by unsanitary dairy operating conditions that lead to infected mammary glands of cows. Pus cells are the same type of cells found in a pimple or 'zit juice.' In 2011, the dairy industry debated lowering the allowable level of pus cells (somatic cells) to just 450,000 per ml, but it chose to keep the levels at 750,000, allowing for more infections and more pus in the pasteurized milk sold at grocery stores everywhere. The Consumer Wellness Center ( www.ConsumerWellness.org ) has calculated that a typical 'milk moustache' may contain as many as 2 million pus cells , meaning that all the celebrities, movie stars and sports stars who allow their images to be used by the processed dairy industry are quite literally showing their faces smeared with pus from dairy cow infections. A look at the dairy industry, without the marketing spin This non-commercial video, which also features undercover footage showing the brutal treatment of cows in factory-like conditions, is intended to shed light on the unsanitary practices of the conventional ( pasteurized ) dairy industry while contrasting that with the substantially cleaner and more humane practices of certified organic RAW dairy producers. The raw dairy industry is currently under assault in America as armed government agents in California, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have conducted violent raids on raw milk producers, destroying their milk inventory and charging them with felony crimes for producing and distributing raw milk. ( http://www.selfnews.com/033220_Rawesome_F... ) Dairy industry promotes fraudulent health claims As this video shows, the conventional dairy industry is also making fraudulent health claims in its 'got milk' ads, including falsely stating that drinking milk will give you 'bones of steel.' A multitude of variations on this theme frequently appear in dairy industry ads. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such claims automatically turn milk into an 'unapproved drug,' meaning the FDA should now conduct armed raids of all conventional dairy producers, seize their inventory, and arrest their owners and operators to be charged with felony crimes for selling unapproved drugs. At least that's how the FDA treats any other nutritional product that makes such strong claims of granting the human body near-magical health benefits. Try to sell an herbal product making the exact same claims and you'll quickly find yourself threatened with arrest by the FTC or FDA. ( http://www.selfnews.com/029901_pomegranat... ) In fact, pasteurized dead milk has never been approved by the FDA as a treatment for fragile bones , so there is no legal basis under current FDA regulations by which the dairy industry could make a claim that drinking milk will increase your bone strength to the tensile strength of steel. Yet, to no one's surprise, both the FDA and the FTC take no action whatsoever against the dairy industry for making these fraudulent health claims and selling what the FDA typically calls 'unapproved drugs.' In truth, calcium alone does not build strong bones, and pasteurized milk is not even the best source of calcium. The pasteurization of milk destroys its digestive enzymes such as lactase, causing the milk to be far more allergenic and difficult to digest, which may explain why so many people suffer from lactose intolerance, digestive disorders, sinus congestion and acne when consuming pasteurized milk products.

0," After toying with the idea of blocking public access to critical information discovered as part of an experiment with H5N1 avian flu, the US government has now decided that certain details of this controversial research be withdrawn from two scientific journals. The UK's Guardian reports that the journals Science and Nature are working to remove certain details from the research that terrorists may try to use to create biological weapons. The controversy stems from research conducted by Dr. Ron Fouchier from Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, who deliberately created a deadly strain of H5N1 that is capable of spreading among mammals, including humans. selfnews reported on this intentional 'militarization' of H5N1 last month, when the government was still considering what to do with the new-found information ( http://www.selfnews.com/034228_bioterrori... ). According to Science Insider , Dr. Fouchier told reporters that he and his team's deliberate mutation of H5N1 had created 'probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make.' US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) chair Paul Keim added, 'I can't think of another pathogenic organism that is as scary as this one. I don't think anthrax is scary at all compared to this.' The only problem with the government deciding to pull this sensitive information now, though, is that it has already been made public at recent conferences where the findings were discussed. In other words, the government is trying to '[shut] the stable doors after the horse has bolted,' to quote the words of former chief virologist of the UK's National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, John Wood. Both journals are reportedly working on publishing edited versions of the papers that do not contain details about how the experiments were conducted, or about how the team was able to develop the highly-deadly strain. Some researchers, however, would still be able to access the original papers in their complete form, according to reports. 'The proposed reactions are nothing more than a public relations measure, a window dressing, intended to convey the impression that the issue is being addressed to minimize negative public reaction and deflect calls for effective regulation,' said Richard Ebright, a professor of molecular biology at Rutgers University.

0," To hear Big Pharma tell it, statin drugs are 'miracle' medicines that have prevented millions of heart attacks and strokes. But a recent study published in the British Medical Journal tells a completely different story: For every heart attack prevented by the drug, two or more people suffered liver damage, kidney failure, cataracts or extreme muscle weakness as a result of taking the drug. Statin drugs, in other words, harm far more people than they help . Julia Hippisley-Cox and Carol Coupland led the study which examined data from over two million patients, including over 225,000 patients who were new statin drug users. They found that for every 10,000 women being treated with statins, there were only 271 fewer cases of heart disease. And yet, at the same time, the statin drugs caused 74 cases of liver damage, 23 cases of acute kidney failure, 39 cases of extreme muscle weakness and 307 cases of cataracts . Statin drugs, in other words, helped 271 people but harmed 443 people. This demonstrates how they are wreaking havoc with the health of those who take them, causing damage that far outweighs any benefit they might offer. Big Pharma's highly deceptive advertising implies that statin drugs help everyone who takes them . So if 10,000 people took the drugs, we're promised, heart attacks would be prevented in all 10,000 people. That's the implied message in the drug ads, anyway. But this is just a wild exaggeration and distortion of the facts. Most drugs don't work on most people , and statin drugs only 'work' on about 2.7% of those who take them. Yet they cause serious damage in about 4.4% of those who take them. So if you take statin drugs, your odds of benefiting from them is less than 3 out of 100. But your odds of being harmed by them are more than 4 out of 100. For 96 out of 100 people, statin drugs do nothing except make the drug companies rich and pollute the waterways every time you flush the toilet. Statin drugs, then, are basically a crap shoot with your health . Keep the pharma profits rolling From the point of view of Big Pharma, they have the added benefit of causing other diseases that often result in yet more drugs or medical procedures being prescribed. Kidney dialysis makes big money for hospitals, by the way. It's a multi-billion-dollar business all by itself. Statin drugs are therefore a way for the sick-care industry to recruit new patients into kidney dialysis , knowing that some percentage of statin drug users are going to end up with full-blown kidney failure. What's really interesting about all this is how easy it is to fool doctors into prescribing statin drugs. Doctors mistakenly think these are miracle drugs, but they're never read the research. They've been convinced by drug reps, misleading medical journal articles and Big Pharma advertising -- and they bought it! Mainstream doctors, you see, are perhaps the most gullible people on the planet. They'll gladly prescribe a drug that harms more people than it helps -- by the millions -- because they can be almost effortlessly swayed into pushing poison pills through 'science babble' language used by drug companies to promote their pills. Doctors are literally walking around today thinking statin drugs are such miracle lifesavers that some doctors openly talked about dripping the drug into the public water supply! That's how convinced they are about the drug's benefits. They think everyone should be taking statins whether they need them or not! It's downright loony. But that's characteristic of western medicine, isn't it? Proclaim your poison to be 'miracle medicine' while utterly ignoring the truth that those drugs harm far more people than they help (and they simply don't work on more than 90% of people who take them). The statin scam Statin drugs are a scam, plain and simple, and the doctors who prescribe them are puppets used by Big Pharma to sell high-profit drugs to people who for the most part won't even benefit from them. That this research exposing the truth about statin drugs even appeared in the British Medical Journal is a minor miracle all by itself, by the way. But it does indicate that the wall of lies constructed about statins by Big Pharma is starting to crack. If the truth about statins were openly known, the drugs wouldn't be prescribed to anyone, and drug companies would be sued for billions of dollars for their false advertising and marketing manipulations. Until that happens, just remember this: Any doctor who recommends a statin drug is a con man drug pusher. If they don't have the honesty to research the truth about these drugs and stop prescribing them, they certainly cannot be trusted with your health. If they're pushing statin drugs on you, they're really just working for Big Pharma, not for you, and they're not interested in real science and the real impacts of drugs on patients. It brings up another hugely important question in modern medicine: Why don't doctors have the capability to question the false beliefs of their own industry? As you might have guessed, that's the topic of another story altogether. Sources for this story include: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64J7B8... "
0," GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump is taking a lot of heat from detractors for many of his political statements and policy stances, but one thing that he's committed to doing is governing in a way that empowers, not enslaves or lords over, his fellow Americans. For instance, Trump is a huge supporter of the Second Amendment , and has pledged that the 'right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed ... period,' according to his campaign website. Trump is also the only current presidential candidate to have spoken out about massive mandatory vaccinations for children, urging the medical community to spread them out over time , and not give them all in one dose, which he also said would lower the incidence of vaccine-induced autism . 'Tiny children are not horses,' Trump tweeted in September 2014. 'I am being proven right about massive vaccinationsthe doctors lied. Save our children & their future.' On the other hand, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton backs mandatory vaccination. In fact, if any political party has become authoritarian when it comes to forcing parents to vaccinate their children or face legal and monetary consequences, it is the party of the donkey: the Democrats. One party wants mandatory vaccination In recent months, we've seen the state of California a state that has remained under one-party rule for decades pass one of the most restrictive mandatory vaccination laws in the country, where even parents with philosophical and religious objections to vaccines were disregarded. And now, the state of Colorado , also dominated by Democrats, is moving to pass legislation that would created a new database to track children who have not been vaccinated. The measure, which is, at least, facing stiff opposition, moved forward in the Legislature recently, even after Republicans gave it lengthy debate and said that the database would open the door to shaming parents who have, for a range of reasons, decided not to risk their children by mass-vaccinating them, The Associated Press reported. A last-minute mistake means that the Democratic House will once again have to revisit the vaccine measure twice before it gets sent to the Republican-controlled Senate (where it is opposed). As the AP noted further: Colorado has some of the nation's loosest rules for avoiding required vaccines. Parents must simply state that they have a medical, moral or religious objection, after which their kids may attend public schools. Federal health authorities said last year that Colorado ranked dead last in school vaccination coverage for measles, mumps and rubella for the 2013-14 school year. Just last month, four cases of mumps were identified in Denver. Democrats who support a vaccine database in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment argued ... that the database does nothing to tighten vaccine exemptions. 'We're doing absolutely nothing to change that standard,' Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver and sponsor of the bill, claimed, according to the AP . 'This is a streamlining bill that takes the burden off our school nurses to collect vaccine exemption forms.' 'Why would we want to track this?' Except that opponents of the measure note that government actions like building databases are generally what precede additional bills seeking to require or prevent people from doing something; otherwise, they say, there is no good reason for the government to be tracking said activity. And Colorado Republicans are well aware of that, citing a bevy of opposition from parents who also fear that Colorado health authorities are making a push to make it more difficult to send their kids to public schools without vaccines. 'There's a lot of people in this state that do not want to vaccinate their children,' said Rep. J. Paul Brown, R-Ignacio. 'They have that right.' In addition, and because they are suspicious generally of the measure, others questioned the need for a database. 'How can you guarantee that this sensitive data will be protected?' asked Rep. Lois Landgraf, R-Parker. 'Why would we want to post this on a website?' asked bill opponent Rep. Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock. 'The only reason I can think is to publicly shame someone.'

0," Drinking as little as one can of soda pop per day is enough to increase your risk of both type 2 diabetes and stroke by a significant percentage, according to a new study out of Europe. Based on an analysis involving about 27,000 people who were surveyed on their health and dietary habits, researchers determined that over the course of 16 years, those who drank just one soda a day were 18 percent more likely than others to either develop type 2 diabetes or suffer a stroke. Published in the journal Diabetologia , the study analyzed data on about 12,000 people who developed type 2 diabetes between 1991 and 2007, as well as data on a randomly selected group of roughly 15,000 people without the condition. Researchers then compared data they collected from a survey on soda consumption patterns among all the participants with their respective health outcomes, and adjusted these findings to take into account outside risk factors such as age, physical activity levels, body mass index (BMI) and total daily calorie intake. After refining the data in accordance with generally accepted standards, the research team determined that the risk factors for both type 2 diabetes and stroke jumped by nearly 20 percent over a 16-year period. These findings correspond with a similar study conducted in the U.S. several years ago that linked daily soda consumption with a 25 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 'In European men and women, one 12-ounce daily increment in sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a 22 percent increase in hazard ratio [sic] for type 2 diabetes ,' wrote Dr. Dora Romaguera from Imperial College London and her colleagues from the InterAct consortium in their paper. This percentage was adjusted to 18 percent after taking into accounts BMI and caloric intake, according to FoodNavigator.com . '[This study] adds to a growing global literature suggesting that there is a link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity and risk of development of type 2 diabetes,' added Prof. Nick Wareham from the University of Cambridge , who also contributed to the study. 'Together with observations from randomized controlled trials, this observation suggests that consumption of these beverages should be limited as part of an overall healthy diet.' Diet soda consumption also linked to type 2 diabetes So-called 'sugar-sweetened' beverages were not the only processed beverages to be linked to diabetes, however. Based on data from the same survey, participants who drank artificially-sweetened beverages laced with chemicals like aspartame (Sweet'N Low) and sucralose (Splenda) were also found to have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes compared to participants who drank no soda at all. According to another study published in the journal Diabetes Care , people who drink at least one can of diet soda a day have a 67 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who drink no soda at all. 'Zero-calorie' chemical sodas were also linked to significantly increasing the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, a classification of risk factors linked to obesity that increase a person's risk of developing not only diabetes and stroke but also heart disease. 'Contrary to conventional thinking, the risk of diabetes is higher with 'light' beverages compared with 'regular' sweetened drinks,' said the National Institute of Health and Medical Research following the release of a French study earlier this year that also linked diet soda consumption to diabetes.

0," There are many reasons why antibiotics should not be over-prescribed, the most important being that doing so has led to the evolution of drug-resistant superbugs that don't respond to traditional treatment. Now, however, researchers have discovered another phenomenon related to prescription antibiotics: Their use in children under the age of two can cause obesity later in life , the UK's Daily Mail reports. Just three or four courses of antibiotics is linked to obesity later on, researchers at the University of Colorado and University of Pennsylvania found. 'Antibiotics have been used to promote weight gain in livestock for several decades, and our research confirms that antibiotics have the same effects on humans,' said study author Dr. Frank Irving Scott. 'Our results do not imply that antibiotics should not be used when necessary, but rather encourage both doctors and parents to think twice about antibiotic usage in infants in the absence of well-established indications,' he added. 'Our work supports the theory that antibiotics may progressively alter the composition and function of the gut microbiome' The Daily Mail further reported that a team of scientists performed a large study in the UK to gauge the reported link between antibiotic use before the age of two and obesity by age four. They discovered that children who had taken antibiotics at a 1.2 percent absolute and 25 percent relative had an increased risk of developing childhood obesity. The risk became more profound the more antibiotics the kids had been prescribed. 'Our work supports the theory that antibiotics may progressively alter the composition and function of the gut microbiome, thereby predisposing children to obesity as is seen in livestock and animal models,' Scott said. In the U.S. alone, antibiotics are prescribed during an estimated 49 million outpatient pediatric visits each year. Also, more than 10 million of those prescriptions are handed out to children for no clear reason. The researchers, who published their findings in the journal Gastroenterology , were surprised by their findings, since there has been an increased awareness regarding the risks of over-prescribing antibiotics, namely the development of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, as the Daily Mail reported: 'Furthermore, children are known to face other tangible risks to antibiotics, including dermatologic, allergic and infectious complications, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune conditions. 'The scientists noted that further research must assess whether these findings remain into adolescence and young adulthood.' We knew that, too, about the gut microbiome They also note that researchers should examine whether specific types of antibiotics are more likely to cause the childhood obesity . Currently the American Gastroenterological Association is promoting and sharing research related to antibiotics and obesity, as well as how they affect the gut microbiome, in order to better inform doctors and patients alike. In 2012, selfnews reported on how misuse of antibiotics puts your health at risk, and that one of the worst things to do is to give an infant antibiotics, since these indiscriminately kill both the good and the bad kinds of bacteria: 'One round of antibiotics will permanently change the baby's immune system, and because a majority of neuro-chemicals are also made in the gut, the baby's neurology is also altered. The antibiotics that have been touted as the savior of mankind from disease are costing us in cancer and degenerative, chronic diseases.' After just the first dose, vitally important gut bacteria are decimated, thus altering the body's immune system and it's ability to make appropriate immune cells. 'Fungus in the gut is now unopposed and begins to proliferate unchecked by the friendly bacteria. After fungus sets up strongholds then parasites move in to share the bounty of food and minerals meant to feed the body. This is the first step for chronic disease and cancer ,' we reported.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Eating a diet low in fat may reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer relapse, according to a study published on December 20 in the 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute.' Researchers studied 2,400 post-menopausal women who had been successfully treated for breast cancer, and monitored their condition for five years. The women had all previously received standard treatments for their cancer, including surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. One group of women was asked to consume less than 33 grams of fat per day 20 percent of their total calorie intake. The control group ate a standard diet of approximately 51 grams of fat per day, or 30 percent of their total daily calories. After five years, the relapse rate among those who had eaten the low-fat diet was 9.8 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the control group in other words, a 20 percent lower risk. The difference was statistically significant, said researchers. When the researchers divided the breast-cancer cases depending on whether or not the tumors contained receptors for estrogen hormones, a different pattern emerged. Among those with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors, women who ate the low-fat diet had a 41 percent lower risk of recurrence. Preliminary results suggested that this difference became even more drastic when the observation period was extended past five years. Among those with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, however, a low-fat diet produced no statistically significant difference in relapse risk. The study could not determine the cause for the correlation between reduced fat intake and reduced risk. Prior studies have shown a correlation between obesity and breast cancer risk, such that gaining 22 pounds can increase person's risk of contracting breast cancer by 18 percent. The recurrence study called the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study was funded by the American Institute of Cancer Research. ### "

But it comes as no surprise, as it is believed this berry is what gives them their disease-free lives that often last for more than 100 years. People in the Ninxia region of Northern China have 16 times more centenarians than people in the rest of the country. According to Chinese legend, a man that ate Goji soup lived to be 252. Researchers began studying Goji Berries expecting to find similar results to other fruits. However, vitamin, mineral and nutrient analysis revealed that the Goji Berry is one of the most nutritionally rich foods on planet! In 1988, the Beijing Nutrition Research Institute conducted detailed chemical analysis and nutritional composition studies of the Goji Berry. They discovered that it is packed with an incredible range of vitamins, minerals, protein, amino acids, essential fats, and health enhancing phytonutrients. Protect Your DNA With Goji Berries Without constant protection, our DNA can be damaged by anything from toxins to bad food to normal daily activities. This damage leaves our body vulnerable to any imaginable illness and premature aging. This protection comes in the form of antioxidants, and the research has shown that the goji berry is loaded with age defying, disease preventing antioxidants. Its ORAC value (the value a food is given for its protective potency) is far higher than blueberries, pomegranates, oranges, or raspberries, all of which are powerful antioxidants themselves. Increase Libido In Asia, goji berries are known as a strong sexual tonic. They increase testosterone levels, which stimulates libido in both men and women. Furthermore, they improve overall stamina, mood and wellbeing, all of which are vital for an optimum sex life. There is an ancient Chinese proverb that states 'He who travels one thousand kilometres from home should not eat Goji!' An Increase in Energy Goji berries help the body effectively deal with stress, emotional, physical, and environmental. They especially balance the adrenal glands, which tend to become exhausted through stress. Healthy adrenal glands and good stress coping is absolutely vital for maintaining energy and overall vibrance. Promote Human Growth Hormone Production The average 70 year old produces 10 times less HGH (Human Growth Hormone) than the average 20 year old. The goji berry's high levels of nutrients stimulate and support the production of this vital anti-aging hormone. Balance Cholesterol and Lower Blood Pressure Naturally The health enhancing properties in gojies guard against cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and strokes by balancing cholesterol levels and lowering blood pressure. Healthy Vision The two most important nutrients for healthy vision are lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which are abundant in goji berries. Research in China has shown that goji berries can reduce damage to the retina. About the author Sheryl is a kinesiologist, nutritionist and holistic practitioner.

0," Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has announced that all the store-brand milk sold in both Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the United States will now be produced by cows not treated with artificial growth hormones. Approximately 18 percent of dairy cows in the United States are injected with Monsanto Co.'s recombinant bovine somatotrpoin (rBST), also known as recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH). An artificial version of the naturally occurring bovine growth hormone, rBST forces cows' bodies to produce 15 percent more milk than usual. Although most cows are not treated with rBST, the milk from many different cows and dairies is often mixed together before being packaged. This means that unless otherwise labeled, most milk sold in the United States probably includes some from rBST-treated cows. Wal-Mart said that its decision came in response to rising consumer demand for hormone-free milk. 'We've listened to customers and are pleased that our suppliers are helping us offer Great Value milk from cows that are not treated with rBST,' said Wal-Mart general merchandise manager Pam Kohn. Wal-Mart is the largest grocery retailer in the United States, with more than 4,000 stores, and the country's largest retail seller of organic milk. The company's move was greeted as a victory by consumer advocates who have campaigned to make hormone-free milk more widely available. While Wal-Mart's action is not expected to produce any drastic or immediate impact on the dairy industry, it demonstrates that the demand for healthy food has reached the mainstream, they said. 'It's reached the tipping point,' said Ronnie Cummins, director of the Organic Consumers Association. 'I think things are accelerating now and people are getting more health conscious and are getting more conscious about the connection between their personal health and the health of the environment.' RBST has been criticized for damaging the health of cows, increasing the animals' suffering and leading farmers to use more antibiotics. Concerns have also been growing about the health impacts of drinking milk from rBST-treated cows. 'When you look at all the surveys of consumer attitudes about food safety, hormones consistently rank way up there, along with pesticides,' Cummins said. Studies have found that cows injected with rBST produce milk with abnormally high levels of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which has been linked to higher risks of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer in humans. In animal studies, high IGF-1 levels have been connected with an increased risk of diabetes and early death. In part due to health concerns, the use of rBST is banned in Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan. In the United States, rBST has been approved for use since 1993. U.S. Department of Agriculture standards, however, prohibit the use of the hormone to produce milk labeled as 'organic.' Because the high cost of organic milk keeps it out of the price range of many consumers, a new niche within the milk market has developed: milk that is not certified organic, but is guaranteed as not produced from rBST-treated cows . According to Cummins, this milk appeals to health-conscious consumers who don't want to pay for certified organic milk. In response to this growing trend, Safeway Inc. now guarantees that its store-brand milk does not come from cows treated with artificial growth hormones. Going even farther, Kroger Co. does not sell any milk in its 2,500 stores, which includes non-store brands, unless it comes from cows that have not been treated with rBST. Likewise, Starbucks Coffee stores use only hormone-free milk. And it's not just hormone-free milk that consumers are clamoring for; in an attempt to boost flagging sales, Wal-Mart has put great effort in recent years into expanding its selection of 'eco-friendly' or 'healthy' food and clothing. In 2007, it even named an executive in charge of developing more 'green' products. Although Wal-Mart has decided to provide milk from cows not treated with hormones, the company is still undecided on whether to advertise that fact on milk carton labels. Such labels are allowed by the FDA, but have been repeatedly challenged by rBST manufacturer Monsanto. The state legislatures of Missouri, Ohio and Utah are currently considering bills to outlaw rBST-free labels. The state of Pennsylvania actually passed such a law, but it was overturned by the governor. On the federal level, the FDA has already rejected attempts by Monsanto to outlaw the hormone-free labels. Until Wal-Mart decides whether to label its milk, company spokesperson Deisha Galberth said, consumers will just have to find out about the decision from news stories, or from the company's blog or consumer hotline.

0," Spinach is one of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet. Popeye got it right with this powerhouse but it is too bad he ate it out of a can. Fresh, organic spinach is much more nutrient dense and contains far fewer environmental toxins than the canned stuff. Most children and adults like the flavor and texture of fresh spinach over the canned alternative. Be sure to pump up your body with spinach on a regular basis. Spinach is native to ancient Persia (Iranian regions). Arab traders carried spinach into India and China. Traders also brought this green leafy vegetable to the Mediterranean regions of Europe and eventually to the US. There are three primary types of spinach on the market. The most popular style on the market today is baby spinach, while one could also get smooth-leaf and savoy (which has curly leaves). Powerful plant steroids Spinach contains its own type of plant based steroids called phytoecdysteroids. Phytoecdysteroids are similar to insect molting hormones and have been shown to dramatically increase glucose metabolism. This keeps blood sugar levels stable and minimizes the need for the critical fat-storage hormone insulin. Additionally, phytoecdysteroids increase human muscle tissue growth rates by 20% when applied in a culture medium. Spinach is extremely rich in blood purifying chlorophyll. This chlorophyll is easily metabolized and used to build new red blood cells and pull out carcinogenic substances from the body. Chlorophyll also provides magnesium which acts to strengthen the blood-brain barrier and protect the neurological system from environmental toxins. Spinach is an amazing source of glycoclycerolipids that protect the digestive tract from inflammatory damage. These glycoclycerolipids are the main fatty acids that makeup the cell membranes of light-sensitive organs in chlorophyll containing plants. Additionally, spinach is an important source of copper, zinc, and selenium which boost immunity. Spinach also contains some very newly studied carotenoid anti-oxidants called eposyxanthophylls. The epoxyxanthophylls that have been researched to show remarkable anti-cancer properties include neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Spinach is also rich in the powerful carotenoid anti-oxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. These phytonutrients are extremely important for healthy vision & brain function. The carotenoids act to protect chlorophyll from intense UV radiation. Under intense sunlight, chlorophyll can convert into an excited form called triplet chlorophyll along with singlet oxygen molecules which act as potent free radicals. The more carotenoids a plant contains the greater the degree of survivability it has and the enhanced nutritional bioavailability it provides. When purchasing spinach be sure to get it organic as the non-organic commercial varieties are considered one of the most heavily sprayed edible plants in the world. Also, look to get it fresh to avoid chemical preservative agents and aluminum found in the cans. It is also easy to grow as a garden vegetable in areas of mild temperatures. "
0," As the debate continues over the degree to which radiation from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant has spread around the world, health officials would do well to consider a 2004 study showing the connection between the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown and elevated thyroid cancer rates nearly 20 years later. The study, published in the journal Radiation Research , found that the risk of thyroid cancer 18 years after the Chernobyl meltdown was directly related to the amount of radioactive iodine that people had been exposed to in the first months after the disaster. The study was conducted by researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and four Russian institutions, and was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. 'This is the first study of its kind to establish a dose-response relationship between radiation dose from Chernobyl and thyroid cancer,' lead researcher Scott Davis commented at the time. 'We found a significant increased risk of thyroid cancer among people exposed as children to radiation from Chernobyl, and that the risk increased as a function of radiation dose.' Before Chernobyl, no thyroid cancer Until the 2011 Fukushima meltdown, the Chernobyl meltdown was considered the worst nuclear accident in history. About 30 people were killed by the explosion, and around 5 million were exposed to radiation. 'Prior to Chernobyl, thyroid cancer in children was practically nonexistent,' Davis said. 'Today we see dozens and dozens of cases a year in the regions contaminated by the disaster, and the incidence continues to rise.' Prior to 2004, all research into the health effects of the Chernobyl disaster had relied on indirect estimates of radiation exposure, such as proximity to the nuclear plants or ground contamination in the area where study participants were living. 'After all these years, many efforts have been made by various research groups around the world to study the health effects of Chernobyl, and hundreds of scientific papers have been published. But ours is the first report that provides quantitative estimates of thyroid-cancer risk in relation to individual estimates of radiation dose,' Davis said. Using a local cancer registry, the researchers identified 26 thyroid cancer patients who were less than 20 years old at the time of the Chernobyl disaster and who were living in the western part of Russia's Bryansk Oblast, lying only about 66 miles from Chernobyl and considered the most heavily contaminated area of the Russian Federation. The researchers then interviewed these patients and 52 healthy controls about factors that might have led to an increased radiation dose . Participants' parents were also interviewed, since many participants were very young at the time of the disaster. Dairy most dangerous The researchers found that thyroid cancer rates were 45 times higher among those exposed to the highest radiation doses than they were among those exposed to the lowest doses. Notably, the single greatest predictor of radiation dose was the consumption of dairy products from cows that had grazed on radiation-contaminated pastures. Such products were high in radioactive iodine-131 (I-131), which is known to concentrate in the thyroid gland. Nearly all of the radiation exposure associated with thyroid cancer risk occurred within months of the disaster, before I-131 decayed into less dangerous forms. Seven years before Fukushima, the researchers suggested that their study might help officials better understand what health effects to expect from future disasters. 'Another potential benefit of the findings is that it allows officials to more accurately understand and document the magnitude of the thyroid-cancer burden that has resulted from Chernobyl,' Davis said. 'This information will be important in designing and maintaining programs targeted toward the victims of the disaster.' "
0," Your body has powerful infection-fighting white blood cells that are your arsenal for beating down viruses, fungi, bacteria and, yes, cancer cells. This arsenal of cancer cell killers relies on certain nutrients to have the fuel to do its job, and that is to keep you alive and winning the 'cancer' war that's going on inside your body, and that goes for everybody, every day. Whether you like it or not, your body is a machine that is made to survive even the worst of odds or circumstance. Your body is built ready to use nutrients to contain, reduce and eliminate a tumor. Your body is built ready, with a very powerful immune system, but it's beaten down and 'intoxicated' from birth, by vaccines, flu shots and dead, processed food. Your system can defeat cancer cells that may be developing, mutating, multiplying and going after weak tissue right now. How will you 'fortify' your tissue, your blood? ( http://www.alternative-cancer-care.com ) There is a special enzyme that the 'bad guys' (mutated cells) use to multiply, and it's called 'ornithine decarboxylase.' You could block this enzyme, and it would be as if you were a general fighting in a war and you cut off the enemy's ammunition and supply lines . How much easier is it to win a battle or war if the enemy can't find its own fuel, weapons and food? ( http://www.cancer.gov ) The FDA , along with the CDC and Monsanto , are suppressing the cures for cancer, because they know you might read the right research and go buy some baking soda, 35% hydrogen peroxide and organic garlic cloves. The seven-year clinical study on garlic curing cancer The largest study ever conducted in history on garlic supplementation was performed by Chinese researchers collaborating with the National Cancer Institute. It was a test to see if the garlic could reduce precancerous gastric lesions. For all you science folks out there, yes, it was a double-blind study and was randomized, with over 3,000 human subjects for seven long clinical years . You want to hear the results? Cancer risk was cut by 60% for the people with the highest intake of allium-containing vegetables , including aged garlic. And that brings us to the miracle nutrient. The miracle nutrient of the Allium genus In 1957, researchers incubated sarcoma tumor cells with the garlic compound alliinase and S-ethyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide , then injected the tumor cells into mice. Tumor growth was completely stopped, in fact reversed, and the mice survived past six months (they only live about two years normally). Mice that did NOT get the compound died within two months! Since human DNA is 99% the same as mice, you are now safe to leave your doubts behind about how this affects humans. If you've ever heard of the Gerson Therapy Diet or the Miracle Mineral Supplement, then you've heard of remedies that purify the blood . It's time to 'kill the fungus' and cut off the enemy fuel lines. Preparation and consistency are the keys If you choose to take garlic for healing, be sure to crush it and let it sit for at least 15 minutes. This is the TIME NEEDED to release the enzyme -- alliinase -- that produces the anti-cancer compounds. There are about a dozen CLOVES per pod of garlic. Hippocrates recommended crushed garlic to his patients in large amounts to cure their cancer. He knew then. If he were here today, he would tell you to eat about half of those cloves daily, but you should be sure and check with your own naturopath. ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) If you don't like garlic or if you desire a handful of other vegetables in the Allium genus , go buy some organic onions, shallots, leeks, scallions or chive herbs. These vegetables and herbs all contain 'organosulfur compounds' (allyl sulfides) that possess antioxidant properties, just like garlic. Then take about a teaspoon of baking soda and dissolve it in a glass of spring water a few times a day. It's all just 'Gerson Basics' after all! Healthy cell superpowers -- activate! Enable the body to fire on all cylinders, all the time. When you uncover the natural remedies , you can't just talk about them and put them to use for a couple of weeks. It's your life's mission to supply and defend the 'machine' -- your one and only organic body in this lifetime. "
0," A bombshell report commissioned by the National Cancer Institute claims that the country's four-decade 'War on Cancer' has largely been waged against 'a vastly misunderstood 'enemy,' that in many cases represented no threat to human health whatsoever.' As reported by the Sleuth Journal , which has been covering the cancer issue, particularly 'the dark side of breast cancer awareness month,' what is needed to correct this injustice is a 'complete reclassification of some types of 'breast cancer' as benign lesions,' such as 'ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).' In addition, the Journal says it has repeatedly pointed out that breast screenings are not only themselves highly carcinogenic, but have also led to an 'epidemic of 'overdiagnosis' and 'overtreatment' in U.S. women,' amounting to about 1.3 million cases over the past three decades. [Reporter's note: selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger , really brought that latter point home when he took Angelina Jolie to task in 2013 over her allegedly preventive double mastectomy .] In recent days, a panel commissioned by the National Cancer Institute published its report in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) confirming that everyone should stop calling low-risk lesions like DCIS and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) 'cancer.' Reclassifying low-risk lesions has wide-reaching implications The following are the far and wide-reaching implications to this recommendation, as reported by the Sleuth Journal : "
0," There are all sort of reasons that people come down with a cough. This symptom can be caused by respiratory infections like bronchitis or pneumonia, a particularly bad allergic reaction, or viral infections like a cold or the flu. It can also be caused by certain medications, such as those which help treat high blood pressure. Whatever the reason, this can be a difficult condition to live with, especially if that coughing is interfering with the ability to get a good night's sleep. There are many products on the market that can help tamp down a cough but before reaching for a bottle of cough syrup, read on to find out more about pineapple juice and why recent studies have found it to be even more effective that mainstream products at taming an irritating cough. Why is pineapple juice so effective for coughs? Back in 2010, researchers in India which has a strong history of natural healing due to its Ayurvedic traditions compared the effects of over-the-counter syrups to a natural mixture of pineapple juice, salt, pepper and honey on the coughs of tuberculosis patients. It was found that the natural mixture was far more effective at soothing down coughs and throat irritation than the commercial preparation. This sparked other studies on the subject, and scientists came to the conclusion that the reason that pineapple juice is so effective for taming a cough is the presence of bromelain, an enzyme that has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which allow it to reduce irritation of the throat and thus relieve even persistent coughing. Also helpful is the fact that pineapple contains high amounts of vitamin C (another power antioxidant) as well as a wealth of vitamin A and minerals like magnesium, manganese and potassium, all of which help boost the immune system and make it easier for the body to fight off infections that cause coughs in the first place. A recipe for a pineapple-based cough remedy Below is a recipe for a pineapple-based cough remedy similar to one used in the Indian study mentioned earlier in this article. Ingredients: "
0," Even as Toyota now finds itself the target of an increasingly hyped-up inquisition about 'public safety,' skeptical consumers are asking the commonsense question: If public safety is so important, then why isn't Congress asking about the dangers of Big Pharma's deadly drugs? Toyota's problems with throttle controls and brakes haven't actually killed anyone as far as we know. Even if deaths have occurred, their number would be extremely small compared to the number of deaths caused by Big Pharma's products. FDA-approved pharmaceuticals kill nearly 270 people each day in the United States alone, and that's according to conservative calculations published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. That's equivalent to a jumbo jet airliner falling out of the sky and crashing in a giant ball of flame every single day in the U.S. If you're concerned about public safety in the United States, there's no industry that's more dangerous than the pharmaceutical industry. All the automobile manufacturers combined can't even begin to approach the body bag count produced by Big Pharma. So why is the U.S. Congress and mainstream media all of a sudden so gung-ho to accuse Toyota of compromising public safety while ignoring the far greater threat posed by Big Pharma? Because Toyota is an easy, convenient target that can distract people from the far worse dangers that no one dares speak of. As long as Americans can be distracted into focusing their fear and anger on Toyota , Big Pharma keeps on committing its crimes without being called to task. And remember: Toyota is a foreign company while the giants of Big Pharma are American companies. Congress is quick to defend U.S. companies like General Motors and Merck, even if those companies pose a very real danger to public safety . Just yesterday, selfnews.com published a story about the deliberate cover-up of deaths caused by Avandia, a top diabetes drug made by GlaxoSmithKline. According to FDA scientists, this drug is linked to 83,000 heart attacks. The company knew about this increased risk -- and so did the FDA! Yet both the FDA and GSK conspired to hide this information from the public, says the U.S. Senate committee report ( http://www.selfnews.com/028233_GlaxoSmith... ). As a result of this effort to deliberately mislead the public over the lack of safety for its drug, Avandia remained 'FDA approved' and now causes an estimated 500 heart attacks and 300 cases of heart failure every month in the USA alone. That's the body count from just one medication. Add up the fatalities from all the other thousands of medications sold by the drug industry and you start to get the picture of just how large this threat to public health really is. People are dying every day in America due to dangerous prescription medications that the FDA knew were dangerous years ago! Why medications are far more dangerous than defective vehicles For Toyota to even come close to this level of dangerous deception, the company would have to deliberately build high-explosive bombs into its cars that were randomly set off when drivers tapped the brakes. If 200 cars a day exploded into huge balls of flame on America's roads, then Toyota might start to approach the level of fatalities caused by Big Pharma's defective products. Until that happens, this whole attempt to attack Toyota over its relatively rare problems with throttle control is just a political witch hunt designed to distract people from the much larger threat to public safety posed by American companies like Merck. Fraud and corruption The real difference between Toyota and Big Pharma is that Toyota is trying to build safe cars while Big Pharma has no intention to do anything other than sell more drugs no matter how dangerous they are. In fact, Big Pharma goes out of its way to actually falsify evidence that attempts to turn dangerous chemicals into 'scientifically proven safe drugs.' It even invents fake diseases and then markets those to the public ('disease mongering') in order to sell more drugs that people don't even need! So where's the outrage against the failed consumer safety practices of Big Pharma? Senators Grassley and Baucus seem to be the only U.S. Senators who are doing anything to go after the Big Pharma / FDA conspiracy that kills so many Americans. On the House side, Congressman Ron Paul gets it, too, but few of his colleagues dare take any action against the all-powerful pharmaceutical industry. So while Big Pharma's unsafe consumer products are killing 270 people a day -- which is far more Americans than are dying from war in the Middle East -- Congress stirs up a hornet's nest of safety accusations against Toyota, a company whose unintentional errors have killed no one... and a company that has taken responsibility for fixing those errors free of charge. When was the last time a drug company offered to pay to fix the damage caused by its harmful drugs? It wasn't too long ago, you may recall, that the drug industry was pressuring the U.S. Supreme Court to grant complete immunity against all liability from all its products! How's that for ducking responsibility? Even right now, all vaccines are exempted from consumer claims of damage, thanks to laws passed by Congress that protect the vaccine industry. So while Toyota is stepping up to the plate to take responsibility for fixing its problems, the drug industry repeatedly tries to avoid any responsibility for all the pain, suffering and death it has unleashed upon the medication-taking public. In fact, getting Big Pharma to compensate even a single dollar to the damage it has caused patients normally requires a class action lawsuit . While Toyota openly offers to recall and repair all vehicles at its own cost , the drug companies actively fight any such effort with an army of lawyers! Sure, Toyota made some engineering or manufacturing mistakes. But in Toyota's case, that's a rare departure from its longstanding core philosophy of quality and safety. For Big Pharma, ducking responsibility and selling dangerous products is the status quo -- it's the way the drug industry does business every single day: Bribing researchers, falsifying data, overbilling state Medicaid programs, bilking consumers with monopoly pricing, burying negative studies that it doesn't want the public to see, paying doctors 'consulting fees' to prescribe more of its name-brand drugs, and so on. This is business as usual in the pharmaceutical industry. Can you imagine the outcry against Toyota if it were discovered the company was bribing the safety testing companies or falsifying safety testing data? The public outcry would dominate the headlines for weeks! Yet when Big Pharma does it, you don't hear a word. It's just business as usual in the criminal pharmaceutical industry, where nobody even expects these companies to act with integrity anymore. But I say to the press and the U.S. Congress if you're really concerned with consumer safety, shift your attention to Big Pharma . That's where the real crimes are taking place. That's where American consumers are being killed by defective products at a rate that makes Toyota's safety lapses seem downright inconsequential by comparison. "
0," 'Feeding the world' is the mantra of Monsanto, the multinational corporation that leads the way for genetic engineering of nature. Scientists working for this machine; for example, take genes from bacteria to put in corn or splice genes from fish into tomatoes. The genetic alterations give the food special properties. The question is: How does rearranging the DNA of nature affect the DNA of humans over time? How does human DNA react to these sudden changes in crops and foods consumed? Could these crop DNA changes cause cellular pathways and DNA expressions to be turned on or off in humans, as human biomes becomes conflicted, not understanding the new variance of DNA suddenly confronting them? These questions remain unanswered, because Monsanto is credited for 'feeding the world' with their DNA manipulations -- for example, engineering corn to create its own insecticide, or engineering tomatoes so they can have a longer shelf life. When Monsanto scientists give seeds these special abilities, they say that less pesticide is needed and that more people can be fed, but wasn't Monsanto the company that developed the most infamous herbicide to begin with -- glyphosate? And how might their genetic alterations cause ongoing need for these chemicals? How is this genetic pollution changing ecosystems, destroying the diverse selection of heirloom seeds needed for farmer sovereignty and food system stability? There's more to it than just 'feeding the world.' What about the nutritional quality of this DNA-manipulated food? What about ill effects on ecosystems? What about farmers rights to a diverse selection of natural seed? Are Monsanto's ideas wholesome, supporting life, liberty and the betterment of mankind, or are their ideas evil disguised as good? Is the mantra, 'feeding the world,' just a front, covering up worldwide evil taking place every day unseen in farmer's fields? Pope talks about evil disguised as good - is he referring to modern day GMOs and pharmaceuticals? At the September 2014 feast of the archangels, Pope Francis stood up and spoke about the spiritual battle being waged in the heavenly realms, the battle between good and evil. He told all who were listening to pray to the angels, for they are there to defend mankind in times of deception. At the Vatican's Saint Martha residence chapel, the Pope warned about the enemy of man's soul and how the devil is always lurking to kill, steal and destroy mankind while disguising his intentions as good. 'He presents things as if they were good, but his intention is destruction,'said the Pope, who also offered hope, saying that 'the angels defend us.' Pope Francis spoke about the ongoing battle for man's soul: '[F]rom the beginning the Bible speaks to us of this: Satan's (use of) seduction to destroy.' Is this battle alive today, and does it exist within the corporate structure of the genetic engineering of food? Is the mantra, 'feeding the world,' just a front, a clever marketing tool to deceive people into a world of controlled monoculture, genetic pollution and chemical toxicity? Genetic engineering may look like a progressive way to feed more and save lives, but its wrought in control. (They manipulate nature's DNA and then claim ownership over it with a patent.) Not only that, but their 'feeding the world' motto is laced with chemical spraying that leads to disease in the human gut biology, damaged soil bacteria and ecological repercussions (death of pollinators). Was man ever intended to be exposed to such a wide range of chemicals, in both agriculture and medicine? Why are pharmaceutical drugs believed to be medicine, while having such long lists of side effects? When did nutrition and plant-based medicine become so overshadowed and demonized? Does the spiritual war that the Pope speaks of apply to modern-day agriculture and medicine? How might agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals be disguised as good, feeding and touted for healing the world, but in actuality, be the very problems destroying mankind today? What spiritual path are you on? Is your life guided by a higher power, protecting you from all the evil in the world that comes in the name of good? Are you walking in faith or following the lies of big businesses that sell toxins packaged as medicines and genetic pollution disguised as food? "
0," Slowly but surely, traditional American culture and values are being swept away by liberal, progressive activists and culture warriors who actively encourage a break from our past, even if they don't say so directly. The latest example of this dramatic cultural shift comes from coffee icon Starbucks, whose CEO and founder recently told customers and shareholders who happen to believe in the historical nature of marriage as a construct between one man and one woman to stay out of his stores. At the company's annual meeting in Seattle recently, CEO/founder Howard Schultz was challenged by a shareholder who questioned his well-publicized position of supporting gay marriage and last year's support of a referendum in Washington state backing same-sex marriages. Schultz's position led to calls to boycott Starbucks from the National Organization for Marriage, and the shareholder explained that led to lower-than-expected earnings. No tolerance for traditional points of view 'In the first full quarter after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings, shall we say politely, were a bit disappointing,' said the shareholder, Tom Strobhar, whom the Huffington Post identified as the founder of the anti-gay marriage group Corporate Morality Action Center. The criticism did not seem to affect Schultz. 'Not every decision is an economic decision. Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year,' he said, according to a video of his response posted here . 'I don't know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months,' he continued. 'Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people . We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity. Of all kinds.' The gathered shareholders responded with uproarious applause. Schultz concluded: 'If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much.' While national attitudes toward same-sex marriage have turned around over the past decade according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey , people who still support the traditional definition of marriage (even if they support a same-sex legal 'union') are openly mocked, ridiculed and labeled as 'bigots' and 'homophobes.' Not a free country for all While many Americans mouth platitudes about supporting First Amendment 'religious freedom,' anyone who voices an opinion that doesn't comport with the liberal point of view on this issue is chastised. If traditional marriage supporters are business owners, they are targeted for boycotts, picketed, and even sued in court. The end result is that the business is put out of business, and peoples' livelihoods are taken away from them. If the traditional marriage supporter is a politician or public figure, he or she will be shamed by the mainstream media, shouted down by gay rights activists (who are given platform after platform to do so by the mainstream media) and forced to apologize. The lone exception in the current 2016 presidential race is billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, although he has not made any claims to only support traditional marriage. It's the worst kind of thought control, and it's about as anti-Constitution as it gets. After all, the nation's founding document is supposed to protect the rights of everyone to say and think what they wish as long as such speech is not otherwise deemed illegal (for example, slander). Even if we don't agree with what that person is saying. Apparently the Starbucks CEO stands with those who would usurp such speech because it's not what they personally believe. During his rant against the concerns of the traditional marriage shareholder, Schultz said, 'It's a free country.' However, his intolerance belies that; in a truly free country where all points of view are equally respected, he would not have felt the need to belittle anyone.

0," In an effort to get more children to drink processed milk, the conventional dairy industry is pushing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the very definition of milk to allow for the discreet addition of toxic artificial sweeteners like aspartame. According to a petition filed in the Federal Register earlier this year, the dairy industry's goal is to change the 'standard of identity' for milk so that it can be further modified and sweetened to attract more young consumers. Whether it is due to increasing allergies or a simple distaste for its processed flavor, conventional milk sales have dropped some 25 percent in the U.S. since 1975, and consumption patterns are continuing to dwindle all across the country. So the National Milk Producers Federation and the International Dairy Foods Association are petitioning to simply redefine the word 'milk' to include other things like artificially flavored and sweetened chocolate and strawberry milk beverages. If the industry gets its way, then not only would these and other processed foods suddenly be lumped into the 'milk' category, but the chemical ingredients contained in these products would not have to be clearly delineated on the front of the packages. Gone are the days, in other words, of 'low-calorie' drinks being clearly labeled -- 'milk' products sold to children would be permitted to contain all sorts of hidden ingredients that could cause them harm. 'The front of the label is really what helps consumers make decisions quickly,' says Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who spoke on behalf of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, as quoted by CBS San Francisco . 'People don't want to go to the grocery store and spend a lot of time trying to decipher the labels and figure out what's in there or what might not be in there.' Artificial sweeteners like aspartame are not safe and have no place in children's 'milk' Besides the fact that the proposal is unbelievably deceptive at its core, there is still a lack of substantial evidence to prove that the chemical additives the industry is hoping to hide in milk are even safe in the first place. Aspartame, which is perhaps the most well-known artificial sweetener in the world, has been repeatedly shown to cause chronic headaches, neurological damage, cancer and, yes, even weight gain and obesity, the very things it is marketed as supposedly combating. 'Aspartame is a dangerous chemical food additive, and its use during pregnancy and by children is one of the greatest modern tragedies of all,' says Dr. Janet Starr Hull, author of the book Sweet Poison: How the World's Most Popular Artificial Sweetener is Killing Us . 'The research and history of aspartame is conclusive as a cause of illness and toxic reactions in the human body.' Even the Academy seems to agree, having acknowledged in a letter to the FDA that the long-term safety of many non-nutritive sweeteners like aspartame, even when consumed at very low levels, has never been scientifically confirmed in young, developing children. Like many others, the Academy opposes the dairy industry's proposal to redefine milk, and the group is urging the FDA to act in the public interest by rejecting it. 'Milk's singular nature and its essential characteristics of purity and wholesomeness necessitate that consumers are readily made aware of any changes to its identity on the front of the package (such as current labeling of fat adulterations), including whether it is flavored or sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners,' writes the Academy in its letter to the FDA, which you can read in full here: http://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com .

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Fountain of Youth Summit, which can be found at ( http://fountainofyouthworldsummit.com ) . In this excerpt, Donna Krech shares her story of going from broke and depressed to fit and successful. The Fountain of Youth World Summit with Donna Krech writer, speaker and 'belief builder.' Kevin: This is going to be a lot of fun and I don't like to waste any time, so let us get right into it. Why don't you tell us a little bit about your story and why you are here on the phone now. Donna: Here's the situation. I have always been a pretty motivated person, as far as, if I saw something I wanted, I would have the inspiration or at least the aspiration to go after it, and I would get involved in success seminars or company training programs or, who knows, new fitness programs, weight loss programs, budgeting plans, whatever! And would be completely motivated about it and then would look up a few days later only to find that I wasn't working on it anymore. Well, some time would pass, I would find the next thing and I would be totally jazzed and 'this time this is going to be it, this was going to be my wealth building planner, this was going to be the one that got my body ripped' or whatever the case was, and I would look up a few days later and guess what? I wasn't motivated again. I had just stopped and what we will talk about a little bit later on the call is I figured out how to figure out what was going on, what was zapping my motivation . First of all I had to figure out that the motivation was getting zapped and then what was zapping it and, more importantly, how to make it ongoing and never ending, but as far as the overall story goes, I was raised in a family with seven children. My father was an alcoholic. My mom was the breadwinner and she was in sales. Shocker! And I found myself in 1982 pushing a baby stroller in Midland, Texas. They weren't paved roads, they were bumpy gravel and I am pushing my baby in the stroller and I am walking to a carryout to buy her milk and I can hear the change jingling in my pocket and I am sobbing, just sobbing out loud as I am pushing her because I know it's the last money I have on earth, and I am wondering how I am going to feed her the next time she is hungry. That is probably the worst feeling anybody can ever have, and now the blessing of that feeling though is that it changed me. As I am sobbing not knowing what I am going to do, somewhere in the back of my mind, because I will tell you I don't remember identifying it at that moment, but somewhere in the back of my mind I said, 'This is not going to happen anymore.' I will tell you that I wasn't just penniless, I was also married, unfortunately, to someone who had a lot of addictions and those addictions went all the way to extremes. When I was depressed, when I put her to bed at 7:30 at night, I would go to bed at 7:30 at night and I know what it is like to be overweight. I was overweight, I was depressed, I had no money and as time moved on and I came back to Ohio and started with a part-time job, went to a full time job, went into management, went into sales, went into business ownership. With every level that I moved up, I found how to maintain motivation better, the sizes were dropping and I was making more and more money and I am still humbled and I do not know how many times I have said this to people , but I still find it all-inspiring when I can say to you out loud that by the age of 33, I was an American millionaire and today, I own multiple companies. We have about eight thriving companies. Kevin: Wow! That's fantastic. And, you know, I think a lot of the people who are listening can identify with the depression, some of the feelings of hopelessness that you had, and I think that even in terms of, not even in terms of just wealth, but in terms of their health , and what can you say to some of these people who are in that situation right now that maybe what... maybe give some examples of what you used to get yourself out of that. Donna: Oh, boy! You know what, the very first step I took is I positioned myself around some people who were going to speak some life into me, and I got around some people, now certainly this call and the series of calls is a great place to start. Also, just getting around people who will speak life into you and that means going to where they are, so you and I both know that could mean a fitness club, it could be joining a personal development group, being around family members who are positive, maybe you've gotten away from them and kind of getting away from the negative forces in your life, that's the first thing that I did and from there, we began to go through how to build motivation by defeating what I love to call the motivation assassinators because they're out there and we're not aware that they're out there, but once we're aware that they're out there, Kevin, it's literally magical because that's how I changed everything. I began to build on the storehouses that keep motivation going and growing; and therefore, I never have to go get re-motivated again. Kevin: OK. Donna: Too often, we have to go get re-motivated, so when you understand how to build motivation on an ongoing basis, then the moment the motivation starts to dwindle, you can instantly identify what is going on and you can defeat the motivation assassinators and go right back into building again. So, I would say the overall answer, what I personally did was I started with my surroundings and I started with what was being spoken into me, that it might be building and improving your focus. What do you want? Why do you want it? It might mean learning how to change your belief, which we will talk about a little bit later, but it may be identifying that you've got some habits that need some altering or emotional reactions that need to be turned into emotional responses. Mine was surroundings. It could be time management. It could just be in this world we live in. We're so doggone busy that we don't realize that what you talked about was like depression. You don't realize that you're so doggone busy, it's feeding the depression. These things are so intricately tied together that when you begin to build never-ending motivation and defeat the motivation assassinators, you start overcoming all kinds of other obstacles because things are so intricately 'tied together,' so whether it's weight loss, whether it's fitness, which is the industry that I've been in and all our brick and mortar locations since 1982, it could also be success, making money, building relationships, which is the speaking and writing that I do. The stuff, the secret stuff that works is the same stuff no matter what the category. Kevin: Yeah, that's fantastic! Now, isn't it hard to change your environment? Donna: You know, you have to go one step at a time. We can be tied to people that... or the attitudes of those people because we think there's a sense of security there. Somebody who has really applied the never-ending motivation concept, as a matter of fact, was involved in a relationship that was very unhealthy and, I mean, she had become completely unfit, she was making no money and she was in a company that had just unending income potential for the position that she was in. I mean, she just found herself so down and when she started studying never-ending motivation, she realized that her surroundings were the real thing that was bringing everything else down, and she just started taking a step and I'll tell you quite frankly, she didn't shift it all overnight. She identified it first, and then she took one little step of starting to add some more positives in her life. She did not just get rid of that negative factor overnight. She just began to add a piece of the positive and she got involved in a personal development program. She headed back to the gym again. She started pouring some good stuff in her mind for her sales position with work and started hanging around people that were already being successful and it just kind of began to happen, it began to build. She didn't do it all at one time, so I think the hard part is not adding the good stuff, I think the hard part is letting go of the bad stuff. Kevin: OK. Donna: And so, we need to add something good realizing that you really don't get rid of habits, you replace them, and so you replace the ones that aren't so good with good ones. Well, the same thing is true with surroundings, as you begin to add more good into your life. There just isn't room for the not so good anymore. Kevin: Right. And in your opinion, how strong is the relationship between your health and the relationships and your interactions with people and other things around you? Donna: Crucial. It's crucial. I think that if you want to be ultimately fit and at your goal-weight and, you know, live until 120 years of age, I think that you... law of attraction, you know, you want to talk about where you are as if you're already there, and in that where-you-are statement is everything that you want including your health. Well, you need to be hanging around people who get that, who talk that way as well. You needn't think about your goal everyday. The thing that is so inspiring to me and this is why I do what I do, you know, people have said, 'Gosh, you're on weight loss, you're in fitness and there aren't a lot of people that are in both,' and 'Oh my Gosh! You're in personal development too, Donna, you know, isn't that complicated?' You know what, Kevin? To me, it's a no-brainer. Those three match so intricately that whether you want my help with building your business, growing an empire, making more money or getting down to a size 4 if you're a woman, I can do that because they're all tied together so much. They just match. If I'm hanging around the people who get again, for example, law of attraction or if I am speaking that way, if I am focused on my goals, people who achieve fitness goals and who achieve money goals or success goals, think about it, they are of a disciplined mindset. If you have a disciplined mindset to achieve one goal, it just became about 300% easier to achieve another goal. So it's just, it's really a matter of which direction you put your attention at, but the character traits are the same no matter what the goal is. So, when you find somebody who has achieved a goal, I can take that person and literally help him achieve any goal they ever, ever wanted to achieve in their life because the disciplines and the attitudes and the beliefs, they are all foundational.

0," You may already be familiar with oregano. It's a warm and savory herb that adds great flavor to sauces in pasta or pizza. What you may not know is that the active component in this herb has impressive healing properties. The active component in oregano that is responsible for its health benefits is called carvacrol. Carvacrol can effectively break down the tough outer wall of norovirus. Norovirus made news earlier this year when it was responsible for contaminating over 600 people on a Royal Caribbean ship. This isn't the first incident of norovirus for Royal Caribbean. This virus is highly contagious and a very common cause of food-borne illness. Although most infected people recover in about a week, it can have deadly consequences for those with already serious medical conditions. Research led by Dr. Kelly Bright at the University of Arizona indicates that carvacrol could potentially be used as a food and surface sanitizer. Carvacrol's ability to break down the external proteins of the virus means that norovirus would be unlikely to ever develop resistance. Additionally, carvacrol is safe and non-corrosive. These findings are especially interesting, because they indicate that carvacrol could be applied as a safe surface sanitizer in place of bleach in schools, day cares, hospitals, rehab facilities and similar institutions where norovirus is typically spread. Some data clearly demonstrate carvacrol's anti-tumor effect on human metastatic breast cancer cells. The research showed that carvacrol expedites cancer cell death. This shows great promise in using the compound for cancer treatment. According to research by Dr. Supriya Bavadekar, assistant professor of pharmacology at Long Island University, carvacrol showed similar results when tested against human prostate cancer cells. 'We tested carvacrol in various concentrations and for different time periods against human prostate cancer cells and were excited to see the complete inhibition of cancer cells,' said Dr. Bavadekar. One of the more common uses of oregano oil is its ability to safely remove warts. Oregano oil is very strong and can burn the skin if used undiluted. When using oregano oil for removing warts, make sure to dilute it in a carrier oil such as olive oil or coconut oil. Try mixing five drops of oregano oil in 20 drops of olive oil and carefully apply it on the wart using a cotton swab. Apply the oil mixture twice a day until the wart dries up and falls off on its own.

0," In approximately 25 years, fresh water may be hard to come by. Two new reports based on three years of research show that the entire world's population may go thirsty by 2040. Remarkably, by 2020, between 30 and 40 percent of the world's population could be affected by water shortages. Much of the water shortage hinges on the way energy is produced today at coal-and natural-gas-fired power plants. Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark, Vermont Law School and the CNA Corporation got together to study today's energy production methods and how they compete with clean water sustainability. They were stunned by what they found and raised alarm. If humans continue on the same path of energy production that we are on today, wasting billions of gallons of water to cool coal-fired power plants, then in 25 years, all clean water sources could be tapped dry. Water waste not accounted for Millions of gallons of water are needed at coal and natural gas fired power plants. These plants require cooling cycles in order to function. Water is taken from the nearby environment to help cool steam at the power plant. According to the US Energy Information Administration, approximately 67 percent of electricity generated in 2013 in the US was derived from non-renewable fossil fuel combustion. The researchers found that most power systems do not even record how much water is used during this process. With no quality controls in place, efficiency is disregarded, wasting unlimited amounts of water . As streams and aquifers are depleted, water security is lost with no going back. Professor Benjamin Sovacool from Aarhus University found this simple fact very disturbing. 'It's a huge problem that the electricity sector do not even realize how much water they actually consume. And together with the fact that we do not have unlimited water resources, it could lead to a serious crisis if nobody acts on it soon,' he stated. Consequentially, not accounting for wasteful water expenditure could force some parts of the world to experience extreme water shortages by as soon as 2020. The studies predict that up to 40 percent of the world's population could suffer. Professor Sovacool says that humanity will be faced with a choice: to continue generating electricity the way we currently do or to provide access to clean drinking water. The need for wind and solar energy is dire Having clean water will most definitely trump energy needs. Power plants will have to adapt to the looming water shortage crisis by converting over to wind-, geothermal- and solar-powered electricity plants. Alternatively, there may be other ways to allow power plants to go through cooling cycles without using millions of gallons of water. Governments are likely to impose new regulations limiting the amount of water that can be used at these power plants. Half the planet may have no other choice but to ditch fossil-fuel-fired energy production . Solar panels and wind turbines are most assuredly the future energy source. Right now in the US, solar power only makes up 0.23 percent of total energy production. Total energy production in the US in 2013 was 4,058 billion kilowatt-hours. Wind power made up 4.13 percent of that figure. Nonrenewable resources like natural gas made up 27 percent of that figure, with coal amounting to 39 percent. These statistics show a great need for alternative sources of energy . The issue is not a matter of politics, not a matter of preserving economy. The way energy is predominantly produced is a matter of human survival. Will dirty energy production take precedence over the availability of clean water for people all around the world? Will humans even recognize this crisis before it hits? "
0," A recent MSNBC Health poll that asked the question, 'Do you believe genetically modified foods should be labeled?' concluded with overwhelming public support for transparency in food labeling. Nearly 90 percent of respondents, representing more than 9,000 votes, answered 'Yes. It's an ethical issue -- consumers should be informed so they can make a choice.' 'It's outrageous that [GMOs] are not currently required to be labeled,' expressed one voter in the MSNBC poll. 'A free market depends on open information from which to base decisions.' 'If the FDA is so confident in GE products, then they should proudly advertise it and let 'We The People' decide whether we'll buy it,' said another poll voter. In virtually every GMO poll conducted, respondents have expressed aggressive opposition. An ABC poll on the subject found that 93 percent of respondents supported mandatory GMO labeling, while more than half said they believe GMOs are patently unsafe. And another poll recently conducted by CBS and The New York Times revealed 87 percent support for GMO labeling requirements. The fact of the matter is that if GMOs are the wonder food that biotechnology companies and their lapdogs in the US government insist they are -- allowing crops to grow 'larger, faster, with fewer or no pesticides, and in otherwise intolerable climates' as they falsely say -- then why not let the people decide for themselves whether or not to buy them? Besides the fact that no GMO in existence grows with 'fewer or no pesticides,' GMOs provide absolutely no benefit over conventional and organic crops whatsoever. The only parties that benefit from GMOs are their manufacturers, which include biotechnology companies like Monsanto, Syngenta, and Dow CropScience. Poor, developing countries are not benefiting from GMOs because they actually require more pesticides, they often produce equal or less yields than conventional varieties, and the GMO system locks farmers into a dependent system from which they can never escape. In truth, biotechnology companies work very hard behind the scenes to paint a deceptive picture of the alleged benefits of GMOs, and they do everything they can to stop any and all efforts to label GMOs because they know consumers will nearly unanimously reject them when given the choice. This was made clear by the now infamous statement by a Monsanto executive years ago that 'if you put a label on genetically engineered food you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it.' And contrary to the opinions of the self-appointed scientific 'elite' that insist opposition to GMOs is 'luddite' and birthed out of 'fear of the unknown,' the exact opposite is true. GMO apologists are the ones that blindly insist that GMOs are safe, even though not a single, credible scientific study has ever proven this to be true. On the contrary, numerous studies have found that GMOs damage the intestines and lead to chronic illness, as well as cause many other health and environmental hazards ( http://www.selfnews.com/026426_GMO_food_G... ). The numbers speak for themselves, though. Americans, when provided with the information they need and the option to make a rational decision in the matter, continue to oppose GM foods. And when enough of them get fed up with the current racket that prevents transparency and freedom of food choice, the labeling situation may eventually change. Until then, consumers will have to navigate the aisles carefully, avoiding likely GMO candidates like conventional corn and soy products and foods that contain conventional canola oil.

0," October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and a group of natural health leaders are focused on teaching the world about natural solutions to the cancer epidemic. Orlando-based Maximized Living has launched the book 'The Cancer Killers' to teach the world how to prevent and reverse cancer naturally. In 1971, President Richard Nixon inaugurated the National Cancer Act and made a strong proclamation that inspired and resourced scientists to find the 'cure.' The government and charitable groups have raised and allocated over $2 trillion over the last 41 years all in search of the ever elusive 'cure.' The number of newly diagnosed Americans with cancer today has tripled since 1971 up to 1.6 million people per year. Over 600,000 people die from cancer each year which is 50 percent higher than in 1971. The media has us believe that we just need to raise more money for more research into the cure. But could it be that we are looking in the wrong direction? Shouldn't we be educating people on how to create a robustly healthy body that kills cancer on the spot? The latest research supports the statement that your body already contains the cancer killing cure. The human body is equipped with a high powered immune system and intracellular, anti-oxidant defense systems that seek out and destroy abnormal cancer cell development. If you follow the natural laws of life, you have the ability to prevent and reverse cancer. Doctor reverses brain cancer and writes inspiring book 'The Cancer Killers' was the inspiration of Dr. Charles Majors of Chicago. In 2010, Majors was diagnosed with an inoperable, stage four bone marrow cancer that had metastasized to his brain. Despite the odds being against him, he chose to leave conventional medicine and apply natural strategies to get himself well. The challenging process of reversing terminal brain cancer gave Dr. Majors a level of authority over the subject. The book is based around the idea that cancer cannot overwhelm a healthy body. The immune system naturally destroys abnormal cells and prevents cancer. The book makes it clear that cancer is merely a symptom of a poorly functioning body. The conventional approach to cancer is that it is a genetic problem and the best prevention is early detection. This approach has proven to be a failure. 'The Cancer Killers' outlines a complete proactive approach to prevent cancer. The cancer prevention strategies include positive mental outlook, maximizing nutrition, healthy nervous system through corrective chiropractic care and regular exercise to oxygenate the body. The book also outlines the role of toxins in the cause of many forms of cancer and ways to improve cellular detoxification. The cause of cancer is a toxic and deficient lifestyle and the true cure is a lifestyle that meets all of our natural born genetic requirements. Cancer cannot live in a highly oxygenated body that has maximal nerve supply to every cell and a potent anti-oxidant defense system in place. Throughout the month of October, the Maximized Living group of doctors is teaching large cancer killer makeovers all over the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Africa. They estimate to have over 25,000 people attend these large cancer seminars to learn about the step-by-step guide to prevent cancer and specific strategies to reverse cancer if they have already been diagnosed.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent multimillion-dollar ad campaign that lends support to Republican lawmakers who support the new Medicare prescription drug benefit was partly paid for by the pharmaceutical industry, political officials say. Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it paid for the ads -- which are airing in 10 states -- a spokesman has refused to disclose whether or not the Chamber received funds from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an organization representing the pharmaceutical industry. The commercials, designed in support of local congressmen and senators, say the Medicare drug program has saved hundreds of thousands of Medicare recipient's money since its inception. Democrats have used the disclosure to charge that the Medicare prescription drug benefit amounts to a plan engineered by Republicans to make more money for drug firms. 'There's a civics lesson here from the drug companies,' says Bill Burton, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign organization. 'They write checks to protect their GOP friends, and then they write the laws to benefit themselves -- all the while doctors are writing prescriptions middle-class Americans can't afford.' Ken Johnson, senior vice president of PhRMA, issued a statement that failed to elaborate on the issue: '[PhRMA] works with a variety of groups, including patient advocacy groups and business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others, to support policies that improve access to life-saving medicines.' 'The depth of collusion among lawmakers, drug companies and government organizations is nothing less than astonishing,' said Mike Adams, a critic of the pharmaceutical industry and author of Take Back Your Health Power. 'That they would all conspire to create false advertising that misleads the American people into thinking they're getting a good deal on overpriced drugs is not at all surprising,' he added. 'Today's pharmaceutical industry is based almost entirely on propaganda, fraudulent science, corruption of government officials, disease mongering and the art of distorting public perception in order to maximize corporate profits.' ### "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget Editorial) It's no surprise these days to hear about a pharmaceutical company committing scientific fraud and distorting clinical trials to get the results they want, but it's unusual to see it done as blatantly and arrogantly as what you're about to see here. In June, 2002, Merck and Shering-Plough began a cholesterol study called 'ENHANCE' to test the effectiveness of their blockbuster drug Vytorin ($3 billion in sales so far). The trial concluded in 2006, and the final results are still not available. Why? Because the companies are sitting on the data, trying to figure out how to manipulate the results enough to make them look good! The trial was attempting to measure the reduction of arterial plaque in the carotid arteries, and this reduction was measured by a high-tech ultrasound imaging technique called intravascular ultrasound . The measurements from the study were murky and unreliable. Some were 'biologically implausible,' meaning the images were showing things that could not possibly exist in a human body. So instead of doing the scientifically correct thing and ditching the study results, they decided to do something arrogant (and scientifically invalid): They changed the definition of what the study was measuring, after the fact! In other words, they decided to cherry pick the data they wanted to use by redefining the goal of the study after it was complete. This is such a blatant violation of scientific principles that it would earn you an 'F' if you tried to pull this stunt in a high school chemistry class. Upon hearing about this utterly non-scientific alteration of the trial goals, the medical community expressed outrage. Big Pharma critics leapt at the opportunity to point out how drug-company-funded clinical trials are little more than junk science designed to distort findings and produce the results desired by the study sponsor. Even Congress got in on the act, announcing an investigation of Merck for its apparent attempt to commit scientific fraud with Vytorin study results. By the way, the FDA doesn't require medical studies to be non-fraudulent. The agency is happy to accept fraudulent studies from Big Pharma -- and it has done so for decades! When it comes to pharmaceuticals, the point of conducting studies is not to discover the scientifically-validated truth about a particular drug's effects on the human body, but rather to provide a sufficient amount of pseudoscientific cover to allow the FDA to approve the drug and proclaim it to be both safe and effective. It's all about sales, after all, and if a little science needs to be 'redefined' along the way to earn another billion dollars a year in the marketplace, then that's easy to accomplish. So now, instead of measuring three points along the carotid artery where plaque typically accumulates, the Vyrotin ENHANCE study will retroactively select just one point. And guess what? Merck gets to choose which point! I sure would like to use this system the next time I got to Vegas. I'll just place my bet on the roulette wheel after the spinning stops! Or maybe I'll go to the poker table, have the dealer toss me ten cards, and then I'll decide which five cards I want to be in my hand! It sure would be nice to be able to cherry pick the results I want to 'count' after the fact, wouldn't it? That's what Merck is doing with this study: It's decided what data to choose after all the cards are on the table! Now, I don't know what your definition of the Scientific Method is, but most people agree it goes something like this: 1. First, you define the goal of the study and declare what you're going to measure. 2. Next, you take your observations and measurements. 3. Then, you analyze the observations and measurements to reach a reasonable conclusion based on the data. Merck apparently believes there should be a fourth step: 4. You discard whatever results don't match the outcome you wanted to see, then write up a conclusion based on the selective evidence. This is what Big Pharma now considers to be 'scientific.' I just call it quackery . In fact, I just posted a YouTube video with a satire Vytorin ad that makes fun of this stupid scientific nonsense now being spouted by Merck. Check it out by clicking the link below: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwendcLch-4 RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Scientific fraud is routine in pharmaceutical medicine today What's important in all this is not simply the fact that Merck is apparently engaged in scientific fraud in this particular study, but rather the fact that Merck thought selectively discarding data and redefining the goal of the study after the fact was an acceptable scientific practice! This is an indication of just how completely drug companies have abandoned anything resembling the Scientific Method and are now just making up the science as they go along. It's sort of like listening to the Bush Administration talk about global warming: They just make up whatever goofy logic sounds good for the moment, and then declare that to be 'scientifically sound.' It's science by declaration! More importantly, the only reason these drug companies have to keep fudging the data like this is because their drugs don't work! If the drug was any good, they wouldn't have to cherry pick the data, would they? The fact that this kind of scientific nonsense is taking place tells you just how shabby the data are in the first place. Let's face it: If you're playing poker and the dealer hands you a royal flush right from the get go, you don't need new cards, do you? Now, I'm not saying that testing pharmaceuticals is the same as playing poker in Las Vegas, but there's no doubt that if you base your decisions on the studies being funded by Big Pharma, you're gambling with your health. Why 'evidence-based medicine' is a joke Modern pharmaceutical medicine has become a grand medical hoax. Beyond all the bribery, price fixing, corruption, dishonest advertising, monopoly prices and deadly drug side effects, underneath the whole thing it's all based on scientific fraud . We're not just talking about one drug and one study here, you see. This is the way Big Pharma routinely conducts business . It's all about getting the results they want to see, regardless of what it takes, who has to be bribed, which researchers have to be intimidated, and so on. The result, of course, is an entire system of medicine that has produced the most diseased population in the history of modern civilization. While Americans pay more money (by far) than anybody else for medicine, they simultaneously rank dead last in avoiding preventable disease (Source: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2008). Americans are the most drugged and yet least healthy people among industrialized nations. Our FDA is the most corrupt drug agency among such nations, and our pharmaceutical companies are in my opinion the most dishonest. There's nothing they won't do to win approval for their dangerous chemicals, including committing blatant scientific fraud. Modern pharmaceutical medicine, you see, is no longer about good science. It's all about good marketing . The science is gone, and it's been replaced with a profit agenda. It makes you wonder how any intelligent person can really trust pharmaceuticals, doesn't it? The truth, of course, is that intelligent people don't take pharmaceuticals anymore . They've found healthier, natural alternatives that are safer, cheaper and far more effective, like turmeric root for cancer prevention, blueberries for cholesterol control and cinnamon for blood sugar control. They're adopted healthier lifestyles, turning to raw foods, juicing, superfoods and microalgae like spirulina and chlorella. They've realized that the drug companies are full of bunk, and that no pharmaceutical has ever cured any disease . Yet diabetics, heart disease patients and cancer patients and reversing their diseases like never before by turning to a plant-based diet , engaging in regular exercise and avoiding all toxic chemicals (including those in foods, drugs and personal care products). To those people who still think for themselves, pharmaceuticals are largely irrelevant. The drug companies -- with all their slick marketing, scientific fraud, political influence and celebrity sponsorship -- will soon find themselves selling products only to the uninformed, low-IQ junk food eating consumers who simply don't know any better. All the smart, successful, sexy, healthy and productive people are turning to natural remedies and increasingly adopting plant-based diets. It's pretty simple, really: Plants make you healthy; drugs make you sick. Plants protect your liver; drugs destroy it. Plants enhance brain function; drugs destroy brain function. Plants are naturally compatible with human biology; drugs are naturally toxic to human biology. Plants need no slick marketing; drugs require slick marketing. Plants were put here by God and Mother Nature; drugs were put here by greedy, criminal-minded drug company personnel who profit from your disease. Which would you rather trust with your life: Mother Nature, or Big Pharma? Be sure to watch my satire video on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwendcLch-4 "
0," While an Australian scientist from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has been quoted saying that the heat has gone out of the genetically modified food debate and that people are now willing to eat GM food, particularly if they understand why the crop has been modified, statistics from public surveys around the world say otherwise. It would appear that, although pro-GM scientists, reporters and politicians continue to manipulate figures and create excuses for consumers being uneasy about genetically modified foods, polls continue to indicate that public opinion still leans very heavily toward a 'No GMO' stance. According to ABC News , in the USA, only slightly over one third of the population believes that genetically modified foods are safe to eat, with fifty two percent believing that they are unsafe and thirteen percent remaining unsure. Surveys in Australia and Europe have resulted in similar figures, with seventy five percent of Australian consumers having said that they would have concerns about eating GM foods, and seventy percent of those surveyed in European countries agreeing that GM food is fundamentally unnatural; only twenty one percent of Europeans believe that genetically modified foods are safe to eat. Statistics also reveal that attitudes toward genetically modified foods varies with age, sex and education level. Those who are more likely to believe that GM foods are unsafe include women, older people, those who are more educated and those from a scientific background. The pro-GM lobby has stated that the fact that many people still buy foods even when GM ingredients are listed on labels indicates that consumers aren't really that concerned, assuming that people are in fact more accepting of GM foods than they might imply when asked outright; however, studies have also revealed that most people don't actually read ingredient labels on the products they buy even when they say they do . It would appear that human beings instinctively understand that the genetic modification of food is unnatural. Almost twenty years after the first GM crop was approved for sale, consumers continue to feel that this technology is potentially dangerous. Many view it as an experiment that is not needed: it is dangerous and is purely about profits for biotech companies that seem hell bent on forcing it down the throats of a population that does not want it. But as much as these companies and their supporters try to change public opinion, it is obvious that most people still don't want GM foods, and public attitude remains unchanged. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) There has been some controversy over the activity of adding synthetic fluoride to municipal water supplies and elsewhere, but not enough. The seriousness of this issue is more than what most realize. Fluoridation ranks with GMO's and tainted, forced vaccinations among the great crimes against humanity. Understanding the Different Fluorides There are two types of fluoride. Calcium Fluoride, which appears naturally in underground water supplies, is relatively benign. However, too much consumed daily can lead to bone or dental problems. Calcium is used to counter fluoride poisoning when it occurs. This redeeming factor indicates that the calcium in naturally formed calcium fluoride neutralizes much of fluoride's toxic effects. On the other hand, the type of fluorides added to water supplies and other beverages and foods are waste products of the nuclear, aluminum, and now mostly the phosphate (fertilizer) industries. The EPA has classified these as toxins: fluorosilicate acid, sodium silicofluoride, and sodium fluoride. For this article, the term Sodium Fluoride will include all three types. Sodium fluoride is used for rat poison and as a pesticide. According to a scientific study done several years ago, Comparative Toxicity of Fluorine Compounds , industrial waste sodium fluorides are 85 times more toxic than naturally occurring calcium fluoride. Health Hazards of Sodium Fluoride Generally, most fluoride entering the body is not easily eliminated. It tends to accumulate in the body's bones and teeth. Recently, it has been discovered to accumulate even more in the pineal gland , located in the middle of the brain. This consequence of dental fluorosis, which seriously harms teeth, from daily fluoridation has been documented. Yet, the American Dental Association (AMA) continues beating a dead horse, promoting fluoride . There is a refusal to admit that instead of preventing tooth decay, fluoride causes even more dental harm. The flood of sodium fluoride in water and food also creates other more serious health problems that are not widely publicized, even suppressed. Nevertheless, in addition to fluorosis, independent labs and reputable researchers have linked the following health issues with daily long term intake of sodium fluoride: "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Rickets seems like it should be a disease of the past. However, more and more children are being found to be deficient in Vitamin D. Twelve percent of babies and children are Vitamin D deficient and another 28% are at risk of a deficiency according to a study for the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Proper supplementation and appropriate sun exposure can ensure an adequate level of Vitamin D. Vitamin D is necessary to build strong bones by helping the body absorb and effectively use calcium. Without proper levels of Vitamin D, bones can become soft, brittle, or deformed such as in rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis. Vitamin D deficiency in babies results in delayed development. It also plays a role in enhancing the immune system and preventing autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D is found in very few foods so is often added to foods such as milk. In addition the skin can naturally produce Vitamin D when exposed to UVB radiation in sunlight. When there is not enough sunlight exposure to synthesize Vitamin D it is essential to get it from the diet. Breastfed babies are at risk of Vitamin D deficiency because breastmilk is naturally low in Vitamin D. Many pediatricians recommend a Vitamin D supplement for this reason when a baby is exclusively breastfed. Other risk factors for deficiency include overuse of sunscreen and eating a diet low in Vitamin D or Vitamin D fortified foods. A study done at the Children's Hospital of Boston looked at Vitamin D levels in children between eight months and twenty-four months old. It was found that at least 40% of these children were not getting enough Vitamin D and that children who were deficient showed radiographic evidence of low bone density. Fifteen minutes of sun exposure (without sunscreen) daily is enough to ensure adequate levels of Vitamin D. Naturally occurring Vitamin D can be found in cod liver oil, herring, and salmon. Fortified food such as milk, cheese, and breakfast cereals can help intake levels. Breastfed babies and others at risk of low Vitamin D levels should supplement. It is difficult to take too much Vitamin D but it can be toxic if very high doses are taken (50 times the Recommended Daily Allowance). Maintaining proper levels of Vitamin D in children is important to maintain bone health and support their immune systems. Speak with your child's doctor about supplementation for breastfed babies, proper diet for older children, and the importance of sun exposure.

0," Watch out for the word 'unscientific' in propaganda that's pushing GMOs, pesticides or other dangerous chemicals onto our world. In a joint letter to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, three Republican members of Congress (Rep. Frank Lucas, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, Sen. Pat Roberts) attempted to spin GMOs as being 'scientific.' They urged the USDA to 'return to a science based regulatory system' and claimed that 'science strongly supports the safety of GE alfalfa.' ( http://agriculture.house.gov/press/PRArticle... ) The implication, of course, is that anyone who opposes GMOs is 'unscientific' (and therefore stupid). The letter further implies that any USDA opposition to GMOs is purely political in nature and not based on science. Apparently the cabal of GMO pseudoscientists have forgotten one of the most important principles of science: The Precautionary Principle which states that when dealing with large-scale unknowns (such as modifying the genetic code of the world's food crops), it is wise to err on the side of caution. Intellectually dishonest spin This effort to characterize GMO opposition as 'unscientific' is just the latest outlandish spin campaign that attempts to reframe the entire GMO debate as 'scientific versus unscientific.' You're either in favor of GMOs, the twisted logic goes, or you're against science! In reality, it's not actually science that's behind GMOs but rather corporate greed , public relations, lobbying and the financial influence of members of Congress. Today, Frank Lucas, Saxby Chambliss and Pat Roberts all effectively painted signs on their foreheads that read, 'GMO sellout.' Another key phrase: 'Unscientific restrictions' This isn't the first effort to frame the GMO battle as a defense of science, of course. The phrase 'unscientific restrictions' has cropped up in the GMO debate throughout the EU, where anyone who opposes GMOs -- even for perfectly rational reasons -- is immediately branded ' unscientific .' selfnews was the first to break the story about how GMOs were being forced into European nations by the U.S. ambassador to France who plotted with other U.S. officials to create a 'retaliatory target list' of anyone who tried to regulate GMOs ( http://www.selfnews.com/030828_GMOs_Wikil... ). Astonishingly, virtually the entire mainstream media has still failed to report this groundbreaking story, which just goes to tell you how deeply in bed the media is with corporate interests. (Since when did the media not cover a Wikileaks cable?) Commonsense restrictions would be a 'dangerous precedent' Continuing with the 'science' gobbledygook, another letter put together by a group of seven Big Ag monoculture crop giants claimed: Agriculture regulators would set a 'dangerous precedent' by imposing unscientific restrictions on alfalfa growers who plant genetically modified seed, harming farmers using other biotechnology-based crops. ( http://www.dairyherd.com/news_editorial.asp?... ) There's that term again: 'Unscientific restrictions.' This is the GMO industry's carefully-crafted spin phrase to try to hammer away at any policy that attempts to protect natural crops from GMO contamination. It also serves to halt any real debate over the issue. Rather than engaging in an intellectually-founded discussion of the potential risk factors associated with GMOs , the GMO camp simply shouts, 'Unscientific!' and demands that the debate be halted. This is the playground equivalent to saying, 'Everything you say bounces off of me and stick on you. Nah nah nah!' It's actually the same tactic used by the vaccine industry. Any attempt to reasonably question the safety or efficacy of seasonal flu vaccines is immediately and savagely branded 'unscientific' before any real debate can take place at all. The bludgeon of 'science' admits intellectual weakness This is the tactic, of course, of the intellectually inferior who have no solid science to back up their intellectual playground bullying. Rather than debating on the merits of good science , they seek to stifle discussion by accusing their opponents of questioning all science. It is, of course, a fallacious argument, and it only makes the so-called 'scientists' appear to look even more like desperate zealots pushing their own particular twisted dogma. That's what the pro-GMO position is, of course: A zealot-infused dogma backed by lots and lots of dollars but absolutely no legitimate science. And yet, GMO zealots continue to argue as if they have scientific truths on their side. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) The most astonishing spin letter you will ever read Take a look at this astonishing letter from Big Agro giants which literally claims that any regulation of GMOs would '...undermine the public's trust in the integrity of the scientific process that the president directed all executive branch agencies to uphold.' ( http://www.selfnews.com/files/GMO_science... ) The letter goes on to say that 'coexistence' (of GMOs and non-GMO crops) would 'set a dangerous precedent' and that all the following regulations and restrictions on GE crops are entirely unacceptable: 'Isolation distances, geographic planting restrictions, limitations on harvest periods and equipment usage, seed bag labeling, seed coloration, and the listing of seed production field locations on a national data base.' This same letter even boldly insists that regulating GMOs would harm America's international trade! 'If USDA moves forward with injecting non-science-based criteria into the regulatory process it will undermine our international trade efforts,' it claims. Linguistic contortionism That letter, in fact, is one of the most grotesque examples of pseudoscientific linguistic contortionism I've ever seen. The author of the letter, whoever he may be, is an intellectually dishonest individual who is knowingly bastardizing the use of the word 'science' to try to hide the real agenda of corporate domination over the world's food crops . The whole point of the letter, by the way, is to request that genetically engineered alfalfa be exempted from regulation by the federal government. This particular pesticide-ready alfalfa is designed to withstand exposure to Roundup. Care to guess which corporation is likely behind this particular bit of nefarious deception? What the letter essentially states is that GE alfalfa seed bags need not be labeled as such; that GE seeds can be the same color as non-GE seeds (so that farmers can't tell them apart), that GE alfalfa can be planted right next to non-GE alfalfa crops (where DNA cross-contamination will obviously occur), and that the location of GE alfalfa fields should remain a secret . All this has been hidden underneath the veil of 'science.' 'Science,' you see, is no longer what it once was. In fact, the abandonment of ethics and honesty by those who invoke the term is now so severe that the entire scientific community is seeing its reputation erode by the day. That brings me to the second part of this article, called 'The downfall of science and the rise of intellectual tyranny,' which you can read at this link: http://www.selfnews.com/031073_science_ty...

0," Today we announce the first investigation conducted at the selfnews Forensic Food Laboratory , the new science-based research branch of selfnews where we put foods under the microscope and find out what's really there. Earlier today I purchased a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets from a McDonald's restaurant in Austin, Texas. Under carefully controlled conditions, I then examined the Chicken McNuggets under a high-powered digital microscope, expecting to see only processed chicken bits and a fried outer coating. But what I found instead shocked even me. I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my decade of investigating foods and nutrition, but I never expected to find this... Update: selfnews has now released a second round of 'mysterious fiber' photos of Chicken McNuggets, in addition to the photos you see below. Strange fibers found embedded inside Chicken McNuggets As the following photos show, the Chicken McNuggets were found to contain strange fibers that some people might say even resemble so-called 'Morgellon's.' We found dark black hair-like structures sticking out of the nugget mass, as well as light blue egg-shaped structures with attached tail-like hairs or fibers. These are shown in extreme detail in the photos below, taken on August 15, 2013 at the selfnews Forensic Food Lab . The actual Chicken McNugget samples used in these photos have been frozen for storage of forensic evidence. We also found odd red coloring splotches in several locations, as well as a spherical green object that resembles algae. We are not claiming or implying that these objects in any way make McDonald's Chicken McNuggets unsafe to consume. We do, however, believe that this visual evidence may warrant an FDA investigation into the ingredient composition of Chicken McNuggets. In particular, where are the hair-like structures coming from? This is especially important to answer, given that chickens do not have hair. Is there cross-species contamination in the processing of Chicken McNuggets? This question needs to be answered.

0," Without a doubt, many associate drinking with health concerns. After all, quite a number of medical conditions are triggered by excessive alcohol intake. It should be pointed out though, that drinking in moderation is best described as a beneficial habit. Indeed, experts have found that liquor intake could bring forth all sorts of health improvements. If you wish to learn about five of the most noteworthy perks of drinking, then you should read on. An assortment of advantages Dodging a heart attack Even though it's surprising, it is true that alcohol could protect you from the dangers of a heart attack. To explain, drinking either beer or wine tends to enhance the flow of blood throughout the arteries and blood vessels. This means that even if there are existing blockages on such regions of the cardiovascular system, a liquor drinker would still be able handle all kinds of physical activities without continuously worrying about sudden death. Avoiding diabetes woes It should also be emphasized that drinking is among the finest means of lowering your chances of developing diabetes. Simply put, scientific experts conducted several experiments in which individuals were instructed to consume alcohol regularly. The result of such technical inquiries was quite straightforward: drinkers exhibited excellent insulin sensitivity and thus became less prone to developing the deadly disease than their non-drinking counterparts. Protection from gallstones You would also be pleased to know that your favorite alcoholic beverages have the capability to hinder gallstone development. Interestingly, the mechanism through which such drinks prevent gallstone formation is easy to understand: the presence of alcohol in a person's body reduces the tendency of cholesterol to accumulate in the bile. It should be pointed out though, that alcohol would never be able to dissolve already-formed gallstones. Evading a mental problem It cannot be denied that alcoholic beverages excel in keeping the brain safe from stroke. With this in mind, it becomes clear why such drinks are considered excellent dementia preventers. After all, dementia is usually associated with brain damage. It should be emphasized nonetheless, that the dementia-preventing potential of beer and wine could also be associated with their social nature. Indeed, those who drink often do so with the company of other people. Escaping kidney concerns Scientific experts have also determined that alcoholic beverages shine in terms of their calcium-regulating capabilities. In this sense, it is no longer surprising as to why such drinks are considered superb barriers to kidney stone formation. Aside from limiting the accumulation of calcium, however, such popular refreshments are also unparalleled as a diuretic. This essentially means that the kidneys are continuously emptied of toxins and other harmful substances. Something to remember As made clear, alcohol is synonymous with advantages. You should never forget though, that perks only come with moderate drinking , which in turn means that you should only enjoy a maximum of two servings each day. Of course, you might wonder as to what would happen if you would overlook such a warning. Well, it would be best to point out that at high amounts, alcohol corrodes and damages organs. Overall, it would be appropriate to say that moderate drinking brings forth health while excessive drinking guarantees an untimely death.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The editor of the medical journal Neuropsychopharmacology, Charles B. Nemeroff, has resigned his position after drawing criticism for failing to disclose his financial ties to a medical company whose device he endorsed in his journal. Nemeroff -- chairman of Emory University's department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences -- co-authored a paper on a device made by Cyberonics Inc. meant to treat depression. Nemeroff's article endorsed Cyberonics' product -- a device implanted in patients' chests that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve to treat depression -- as 'a promising and well-tolerated intervention.' Nemeroff was one of eight authors of the article with financial ties to Cyberonics, and a ninth author was an employee of the company. Last month the Wall Street Journal sharply criticized Nemeroff and Neuropsychopharmacology for failing to disclose such financial conflicts of interest. Nemeroff then published a correction disclosing his and his co-authors' relationships with Cyberonics. 'The surprise is not that Nemeroff lacks fundamental ethics and abused his power as a medical journal editor to pad his own pockets; the surprise is that he got caught,' said Mike Adams, a consumer health advocate and critic of unethical practices in conventional medicine. 'Notice how he only published a correction after being exposed by the Wall Street Journal?' 'You have to remember,' Adams explained, 'that virtually everyone in conventional medicine -- from doctors to journal editors to FDA advisory panel members -- claim they operate with such supreme intellect that they are immune to financial influence, and thus there is no need for them to even disclose conflicts of interest. Conventional medicine is an industry that believes it is above the laws of ethics, and that it should operate with impunity, without any serious scrutiny or disclosure. They seem to demand, 'How dare you question our judgment?' while simultaneously pocketing cash from pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers,' Adams said. 'The arrogance is astonishing.' The medical society that publishes the journal says Nemeroff's resignation -- reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal -- was partly because of bad publicity over his failure to enforce the journal's conflict-of-interest policies. ### "

0," Are the worries of life keeping you up at night? Do you have trouble unwinding at the end of the day, and end up staring at the television or ceiling for hours trying to fall asleep? If getting normal rest is troublesome for you, there is hope apart from having to pop a sleeping pill every night just to get some shut-eye. Here are some helpful tips for overcoming insomnia without the use of prescription drugs: 1) Avoid processed foods You are probably starting to notice a pattern with many of our papers on conquering illness -- changing your diet is the key to vibrant health. So much of the food people eat today contains high amounts of refined sugar, processed flours, chemical flavor enhancers, food colorings, and shelf-stable oils and preservatives that the average person simply is not getting the nutrients he or she needs to achieve systemic equilibrium. Refined sugar and other simple carbohydrates, for instance, are very quickly absorbed into the bloodstream where they tend to overstimulate the body and interfere with normal sleeping patterns. According to Dr. Michael Murray, N.D., artificial food colorings may also be to blame, as these chemical compounds trigger a stimulant response that can put your body into 'fight or flight' mode, where adrenaline, also known as cortisol, and other hormones are released in excess, signaling to your body that it is time to be awake and alert. Cutting processed foods out of your diet, particularly from the time between when the sun goes down and when you go to bed, can help promote restfulness and calm in preparation for sleep ( http://doctormurray.com ). 2) Fortify your diet with whole fruits and vegetables, 'superfoods' . Since cutting out certain foods from your diet leaves an even greater nutritional void, it is important to replace these foods with more appropriate ones. In the case of frequent insomnia , organically-grown whole fruits and vegetables are an important addition to your diet as most varieties promote alkalinity and inhibit the feeding of candida and other harmful yeasts that can actually be a cause of insomnia-producing anxiety for some people. Many people have reported success overcoming insomnia by switching to a completely alkaline-forming diet, at least for a few days ( http://www.selfnews.com ). Along with this, consuming high-density 'green' supplements and powders like BOKU Superfood and Amazing Grass can help level out your nervous system and feed your body concentrated doses of not only 'superfood' fruits and vegetables, but also a diverse array of probiotics, microalgae, and other foods of which you are likely not eating enough, or perhaps not eating at all. Juicing fresh, organic fruits and vegetables in the morning and mixing in some green superfood powder is a great way to start your day on the right foot so you will feel ready to sleep once nighttime arrives ( http://www.selfnews.com/022753_food_superfood_taste.html ). 3) Turn off all your electronic gadgets a few hours before going to bed . In order for your body to know that it is the appropriate time to begin producing sleep hormones like melatonin, light sources must be kept off or at least very dimly lit in the few hours prior to bedtime. The constant glow that comes from looking at your television, computer, tablet, and mobile phone screens basically signals to your brain that it is still daytime, which inhibits the normal production of sleep hormones that calm your brain and induce restfulness. 'We all suffer from light pollution -- we have lights on 24/7, which keeps our brains chronically aroused,' says Rubin Naiman, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the University of Arizona 's Program in Integrative Medicine, and sleep director at the Miraval Resort in Tucson, Arizona, about how excess light can create insomnia. 'Most people don't recognize how essential darkness is for a sound night's sleep' ( http://www.msnbc.msn.com ). 4) Exercise daily to exert energy . Another common cause of insomnia is lack of physical exercise, which creates natural sleepiness in your body after a long day. Many people sit in fluorescent-lit cubicles for most of the day, and come home and spend more sedentary time on the couch watching television. By engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every day, even if this means just going for a quick walk around the neighborhood, or lifting weights and exerting your muscles, especially if you are a man, you will naturally fatigue your body to the point that sleep will come much more easily at the end of the day. 'The body must exert energy to get physically tired,' says James Maas, a professor of psychology at Cornell University , and author of the book Power Sleep . And this energy exertion, numerous studies have shown, actually works better than benzodiazepines and other types of sleeping pills at inducing sleep and improving sleep quality.

0," Oxidative stress is a constant force in our everyday life. When our body is able to handle and adapt effectively to the oxidative stressors we are able to get stronger and healthier. However, when the stressors become too much for our body to adapt to, we get weaker and sicker. Elevated oxidative stress is the major factor in degenerative diseases such as cancer, heart disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and neurodegenerative diseases. These occur over many years of inability to successfully adapt to the oxidative stressors. This happens when the body's antioxidant defenses are insufficient to neutralize dangerous free radical compounds called reactive oxygen species (ROS). What are free radicals and anti-oxidants? These free radicals are unstable molecular species produced during basic metabolic functions ranging from immune function to mitochondrial energy generation to liver detoxification. Free radicals are unstable due to the outer unpaired electrons in their molecular structure. These electrons are able to interact and alter any compound in their direct environment. To protect against the damaging effects of these free radicals the cells utilize antioxidants. This includes exogenous or dietary anti-oxidants such as citrus bioflavonoids, proanthocyanins from berries, polyphenols found in green tea, chocolate and coffee and carotenoids found in foods like egg yolk, wild-caught salmon and carrots. The body also produces endogenous derived anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. These are produced within the cells and help to protect the outer cell membrane, the DNA and the energy-producing mitochondria of the body. The effect of anti-oxidants in the body These anti-oxidants have a powerful anti-inflammatory action in the body and protect the cells, tissues and organs from inflammatory and oxidative stressors. This is a critical player in healthy aging, high quality of life and chronic disease prevention. Anti-oxidant needs can vary between individuals and so clinical testing has been developed in order to assess an individual's level of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant compounds. This testing allows the practitioner to pinpoint the key deficiencies that are limiting the body's ability to adapt and heal. Key measurement should include the major endogenous anti-oxidants and the ratio of biochemical metabolites. This includes glutathione, cysteine, cysteine/cystine ratio, sulfate and cysteine/sulfate ratio, and total antioxidant capacity. The test should also look at major anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Finally, the test should analyze levels of cell damage such as lipid peroxidases. The importance of quenching oxidative stress Free radicals and resulting oxidative stress are a necessary part of life and stimulate growth and adaption throughout the body. An individual with optimized anti-oxidant protection will successfully adapt to the normal oxidative stress levels place on the body from normal metabolism and the environment. An individual with inadequate anti-oxidant protection will not be able to successfully adapt to oxidative stress demands and will develop serious health issues over time. Chronically elevated oxidative stress levels are a lethal process that can persist silently and insidiously break-down the body long before major symptoms occur. Evaluating the body's ability to produce and utilize anti-oxidants can be done in a comprehensive fashion. This includes biomarkers for anti-oxidant reserves, enzyme function and cellular damage. The full comprehensive panels allow for clinicians to assess the entire picture of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant protection. "
0," Vitamin D deficiency is a major cause of breast cancer among women, according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study, authored by a team of scientists from various organizations, reports that women in Saudi Arabia who have low vitamin D levels have six times the risk of having breast cancer than women with higher levels. Researchers urge others to increase vitamin D intake for a myriad of life-saving health benefits. The case-control study analyzed data from 120 breast cancer cases and an equal amount of controls. The study found that Saudi Arabian women in the lowest vitamin D category, less than 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml), had six times the risk for evasive breast cancer as people in the highest category of vitamin D status, greater than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml). Women in Saudi Arabia, even though they reside in a high UV sunlight exposure area, have very low levels of vitamin D. This is due to a modern indoor lifestyle, darker skin types, cultural practices of dress and the fact that the food supply is not fortified with vitamin D like it is in Canada and the USA. The data collected for the study indicated that breast cancer cases had significantly lower serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], at an average of 9.4 ng/mL, than did controls, which averaged at 15.4 ng/mL. 'These results are not surprising' says Dr. Cedric Garland, a Professor from the UCSD Department of Family and Preventive Medicine. 'There are numerous studies supporting that women need vitamin D levels exceeding the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guideline of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml) to help prevent breast cancer.' ( http://www.prweb.com ) 'Our study, published in the Annals of Epidemiology in July 2009, reported that raising women's 25(OH)D blood serum level to 100-150 nmol/L (40-60 ng/ml) would prevent 58,000 new cases of breast cancer and three quarters of deaths from these diseases in the US and Canada.' added Dr. Garland. 'We need help and support from the medical community especially family doctors to communicate this to their patients and put the vitamin D breast cancer prevention opportunity into daily practice to save lives.' ( http://www.prweb.com ) 'Optimal levels of vitamin D have the potential to drastically reduce breast cancer cases in Canada and the USA' said Perry Holman, Executive Director for the Vitamin D Society. 'The Vitamin D Society recommend that people have their 25(OH)D level tested either through their family doctor or by purchasing a home test kit through health suppliers such as GrassrootsHealth. If your vitamin D test score is low, below 100 nmol/L Canada or 40 ng/ml USA, take immediate action to increase your vitamin D intake.' ( http://www.prweb.com ) Arash Hossein-nezhad, MD, PhD, Michael F. Holick, PhD, MD of the Boston University Medical Center published an article, 'Vitamin D for Health: A Global Perspective,' detailing the health benefits associated with vitamin D. Their article outlines how vitamin D deficiency continues to be a problem in today's society and the risks associated with it. 'Because body fat can sequester vitamin D, it is now recognized that children and adults who are obese require 2 to 5 times more vitamin D to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency,' writes Hossein-nezhad and Holick, suggesting that America's disturbing obesity rate may mean that a growing number of citizens are suffering from vitamin D deficiency, whether they realize it or not. ( http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) Vitamin D can be found naturally in very few foods. Wild salmon and mushrooms exposed to UV rays are two of the scarce natural food items containing vitamin D. Despite this, Hossein-nzhad and Holick's article goes on to list other available sources of vitamin D and how to increase one's uptake of the important nutrient: ' Vitamin D intake can be increased by eating foods fortified with vitamin D. A recent systematic review found that food fortification with vitamin D (especially in milk) is effective in significantly increasing 25(OH)D levels in the population.7, 252 Other foods include some cereals, juices, other dairy products, and some margarines. A mean individual intake of approximately 11 g/d (440 IU/d) from fortified foods (range, 120-1000 IU/d) increased 25(OH)D concentrations by 7.7 ng/mL, corresponding to a 0.48-ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D for each 40 IU (1 g) ingested.' ( http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) Hossein-nzhad and Holick's paper finishes with words of advice, urging readers to increase the amount of vitamin D they intake: 'There is potentially a great upside (in terms of improving overall health and well-being) to increasing serum 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/mL. An effective strategy to prevent vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is to obtain some sensible sun exposure, ingest foods that contain vitamin D, and take a vitamin D supplement.'

0," Lately, it seems that every supermarket has a hand-sanitizing station prominently displayed near the doors. In fact, the trend of using hand sanitizers has really ramped up in recent years, with more people carrying around their own personal-size versions of the stuff around with them. And why not? Hand sanitizers seem like the perfect way to stay clean and disinfect on the go and don't seem to have any downside. Unfortunately, there are some hidden down sides lurking in supposedly 'clean' hand sanitizers that could lead to trouble with regular and repeated use. As you'll see below, finding out the real truth about products we use daily is vital, especially when matters of health and well-being are concerned. Triclosan Triclosan is antibacterial chemical agent added mainly to soaps and personal care and cleaning products. Strangely, it's also found in clothing, cookware, furniture and toys in an attempt to reduce bacteria levels. Research on triclosan has raised questions about potential hazards to human health. Triclosan has been shown to disrupt hormone regulation, disrupt immune system function and contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (i.e. superbugs). Indeed, the use of triclosan is contributing to an epidemic of antibiotic resistance. This happens when bacteria are regularly exposed to antibacterial agents; the bacteria adapt and grow stronger, more resistant and more immune. Parabens Parabens are ubiquitously found in many personal care products such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soaps, hand sanitizers and lotions for the purpose of discouraging the growth of microbes. If you look at the label of personal care products, you'll see one or more of these names: ethylparaben, butylparaben, methylparaben and propylparaben. Unfortunately, parabens are linked to endocrine disruption, skin irritation, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity and cancer. Parabens also mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells, and they increase the expression of genes regulated by estradiol, a natural form of estrogen. Because parabens are used to kill microbes in water-based products, they inherently contain toxicity for cells in general. Chemically synthesized artificial fragrances Most hand sanitizers have a fragrance, and that means that they are very likely to be full of toxic chemicals. Because fragrances are considered to be 'trade secrets,' companies aren't required to disclose what ingredients they contain. That means that they can be created from just about anything -- including hundreds of dangerous chemical compounds. Artificial and chemical fragrances have been associated with allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress, hormone disruption and potentially negative effects on the reproductive system. The solution here is to look for unscented hand sanitizers to avoid chemically synthesized fragrances. But even unscented hand sanitizers may still contain triclosan and parabens; if you look at the label and see the word antibacterial , it means that your hand sanitizer likely contains triclosan and you should inspect the ingredients label to make sure. Better options and solutions While not as convenient or trendy, getting back to basics and just using soap and water is really a better, time-tested way to clean your hands. But there are also natural hand sanitizers appearing on the market which don't contain yucky chemicals. It's always nice to support companies that create products that have ingredients in them that you can actually pronounce...

0," Yes, women are complicated. That much is obvious. By both natural design and the acknowledgement of even prehistoric, mythological culture, the life-bearing ways of the female human creature are both intricate and mysterious. But did you ever wonder why it seems women are always more susceptible to biological vulnerability? The reasons are multi-fold. With so many biological conditions necessary for the effective functioning of the female reproductive system - from menstruation and fertility, to conception and child-bearing - women can be particularly sensitive to both internal and external stimuli. And current culture certainly offers plenty of health challenges from which to choose. If a woman has a poor diet, inactive lifestyle, a stressful career and is not well rested, for example, she may not only feel tense and physically congested, but also find she is at greater risk for complication. This is because these behaviors affect the metabolic rate and hormonal imbalance of the body, resulting in breast tenderness, skin blemishes, food cravings, lowered immune function, decreased resistance to pathogens and infectious germs, and any number of gynecological disorders. To combat these unwanted developments, it is important for women to understand their bodies first from a holistic perspective, to acknowledge, regardless of the symptom that arises, that such symptoms are merely superficial indicators of a much deeper imbalance - one that requires meaningful lifestyle shifts related to diet, activity, etc. From there, to compliment the beneficial behaviors already in place, a woman may desire to seek additional therapeutic support from various herbal remedies, applicable toward everything from regulating and balancing hormones to relieving tension and pain. Dong quai Most popular for its success in relieving menstrual complaints and menopausal symptoms, this pungently sweet Chinese herb is also commonly applied in cases of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and is useful in addressing irregular cycles and cramping. Naturally high in vitamin B-12, Dong quai contains ferulic acid, a muscle relaxer and pain reliever, as well as blood-thinning chemicals known as coumarins, which work to improve circulation and ensure blood flow to female reproductive organs. Dong quai should be avoided by pregnant women and those suffering from either diarrhea or endometriosis. Blue cohosh This Native American medicine works primarily to help tone and strengthen the uterus. It contains an alkaloid called methyl cytosine, which is believed to be antispasmodic. It also combats painful menstrual flow irregularities by dilating blood vessels in the uterus, allowing for increased circulation in the pelvic area. Women who are pregnant; however, should take care to avoid all products containing blue cohosh . Large doses of the herb were once used by Native American tribes to prevent conception, though modern herbalists now consider it unreliable for that purpose. Cinnamon bark Look for medicinal quality cinnamon, known as Rou Gui , in either Chinese herbal pharmacies or health foods stores. Its pungent sweetness makes it the ideal warming ('yang') tonic for relieving menstrual cramps. Women who find they are chronically cold ('yin'), dry or frail and who may routinely be afflicted with osteoarthritis, asthma or digestive problems will enjoy the greatest benefits from this herbal remedy. Though its side effects are few, be sure to use cinnamon with caution during pregnancy . Chaste tree berries Reportedly used by monks back in the Middle Ages to help curb their sexual appetite, this herbal remedy may occasionally reduce sex drive in women, but not to the extent suggested by its clever name. These days, it plays a significant role in hormone regulation, acting directly on the brain's pituitary gland. Flavonoids present in chaste tree are known to slightly increase women's progesterone production, a lack of which is often the cause of menstrual complaints, infertility, heavy bleeding, excessive periods, irregular periods, no periods and PMS. Chaste tree is a bitter-tasting, slow-acting herb, but over several months, can prove helpful with all these conditions as well as premenstrual fluid retention and even acne. Due to its direct involvement in these hormonal processes, chaste tree is not recommended for use by pregnant women . "
0," Most of us are supportive of our local police departments but because of a lousy state Supreme Court decision in Indiana last year, residents of the state now have the right to shoot at officers in defense of their property if they believe they are being improperly raided. Not surprisingly, most police officers are upset about the law, which was signed by Gov. Mitch Daniels in March, because they believe now it will be 'open season' on law enforcement officers. But supporters say the law will encourage nothing of the kind. They say its sole purpose is to allow homeowners the same rights they've always had - to defend their property with deadly force, if necessary, even if that means defending it against 'public servants' who illegally enter homes and automobiles. Here's how it all began. Right to resist 'incompatible with modern Fourth Amendment jurisprudence' Police were called to the home of a man and woman who were reportedly fighting outside of their apartment. The couple went back inside the apartment after police arrived, with the husband telling officers they were no longer needed. An officer entered the apartment anyway, at which time the husband shoved him against a wall; a second officer then used a stun gun on the husband and arrested him. In a March 2011 ruling, Indiana's highest court, in a 3-2 decision, said, essentially, that police officers had the right to enter a home for any reason, or for no reason at all, and a homeowner was powerless to stop them. The ruling, said some legal analysts, overturned hundreds of years' worth of common law which dated back to England's Magna Carta in 1215, granting homeowners a so-called 'Castle Doctrine' right to protect their property. 'We believe [...] a right to resist an unlawful police entry into a home is against public policy and is incompatible with modern Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,' wrote Justice Steven David, for the majority. 'We also find that allowing resistance unnecessarily escalates the level of violence and therefore the risk of injuries to all parties involved without preventing the arrest.' Much of the legal establishment agreed. 'It's not surprising that they would say there's no right to beat the hell out of the officer,' Ivan Bodensteiner, a professor at Valparaiso University School of Law , told local media. '(The court is saying) we would rather opt on the side of saying if the police act wrongfully in entering your house your remedy is under law, to bring a civil action against the officer.' Like the majority of Supreme Court justices, however, Bodensteiner obviously doesn't see the irony in his claim - that Indiana residents would have had remedy in court against the improper actions of a police officer. That seems odd, considering the man upon whom the Supreme Court case was based lost . The two dissenting justices - Robert Rucker and Brent Dickson - deferred to the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful searches and seizures, as well as the Bill of Rights' privacy protections. 'Unwarranted and unnecessarily broad' 'In my view the majority sweeps with far too broad a brush by essentially telling Indiana citizens that government agents may now enter their homes illegally -- that is, without the necessity of a warrant, consent or exigent circumstances,' Rucker wrote for the minority. 'I disagree.' They suggested if the court had limited its ruling to just allowing police to enter homes in a domestic violence case they would have supported the decision. But, Dickson said, 'The wholesale abrogation of the historic right of a person to reasonably resist unlawful police entry into his dwelling is unwarranted and unnecessarily broad.' Constitution be damned, opponents of the measure, especially police organizations, are crying foul. 'If I pull over a car and I walk up to it and the guy shoots me, he's going to say, 'Well, he was trying to illegally enter my property,'' 17-year veteran police Sgt. Joseph Hubbard, of the Jeffersonville, Ind., police department, said. 'Somebody is going get away with killing a cop because of this law.' State Sen. Michael Young, author of the original legislation, disagrees. He says there is no widespread problem among Indiana residents wanting to take on police. And, he rightfully pointed out, the law would have been unnecessary were it not for the troubling Supreme Court ruling. "
0," The next generation of genetically engineered life will more than likely possess a novel trait known as 'gene drive' that literally spreads gene alterations like a virus within the host population, whether it is a plant or an animal. Many scientists are starting to worry that if it is placed into the wrong hands, the self-replicating technology could eventually turn GMOs (genetically-modified organisms) into covert bio-weapons for destroying food crops, livestock and even humans. Gene drive is the scientific community's latest attempt to domesticate Mother Nature and eliminate undesirable issues such as mosquito-borne illnesses -- or at least that's what we're being told. The Independent (U.K.) says that gene drive technology has the potential to 'address global problems in health,' but it also warns that gene drive has the potential to worsen global problems in health, not to mention contaminate the entire food chain with irreversible GM traits. In a letter in the peer-reviewed journal Science , a cohort of 27 leading geneticists has urged the scientific community to take a step back and consider the ways in which gene drive technology poses serious risks to human health and the environment. In essence, the technology gives genetic butchers the ability to ignite a chain reaction of genetic changes that can't be stopped, effectively transforming an entire population of life within just a few generations. 'Just as gene drives can make mosquitos unfit for hosting and spreading the malaria parasite, they could conceivably be designed with gene drives carrying cargo for delivering lethal bacterial toxins to humans,' warns David Gurwitz, a geneticist from Tel Aviv University in Israel. Gene drive technology artificially speeds up the spread rate of GM traits Under normal circumstances, altered genes only have about a 50 percent chance of being passed on to future generations. A visual diagram published by The Independent illustrates this, showing how even over the course of several generations of exposure, genetically altered mosquitoes only pass their traits on to a small percentage of their offspring, preserving wild-type features within its population to some degree. Gene-drive inheritance, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal. Gene-drive alterations are artificially sped up to promote more rapid changes within a population, so they infect many more organisms at a much faster rate. Gene-drive inheritance also spreads GM traits much more quickly within a single organism, resulting in a nearly total transformation within just a few subsequent generations, as illustrated in the following diagram from The Independent : 'The additional genetic elements of Crispr (a type of gene drive technology) cause a chain reaction where the mutation is passed between chromosomes in the same organism, causing up to 97 per cent inheritance in resulting offspring-generations,' explains The Independent about gene-drive inheritance. CRISPR gene-editing technique can be done for just $30, Nature paper admits CRISPR, as explained in a recent feature article published in Nature , is a 'cheap, quick, and easy to use' gene editing method that involves the delivery of an enzyme known as Cas9 into the target DNA of a given organism. Once there, this enzyme proceeds to edit the DNA to either disrupt target genes or insert desired consequences into them, a process that costs as little as $30. The paper refers to the technology in terms of it being 'democratized,' meaning it's available to nearly everyone who wants it and knows what to do with it. Experts warn that this is one of the primary reasons it is considered immensely dangerous. 'The two applications of CRISPR technology that I'm the most worried about are edits to human reproductive tissue and the generation of and release into the wild of transgenic organisms that are capable of propagating edits,' writes Brian Farley, a molecular biologist from the University of California, Berkeley, in response to a Quora question about the dangers or threats of CRISPR technology. 'If we generate successfully edited sperm or eggs and then use them for in vitro fertilization, we'll create individuals that carry those edits in every single cell of their bodies.' "
0," It doesn't matter whether you are an opponent of Obamacare, as most Americans are, according to numerous surveys since the law's passage by Congress and subsequent rewrite and legitimization by the U.S. Supreme Court. You're going to pay for it anyway, and dearly, according to a new bombshell report from the Congressional Budget Office. As reported by Britain's Daily Mail newspaper in online editions, the cost to the federal government, or, more accurately, the taxpayers who fund it, for every new person insured under the law will be in the neighborhood of $50,000. The paper said budget figures like that one were buried within a 15-page section in the nonpartisan CBO's latest 10-year budget outlook. The Mail further reported: The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion -- or $50,000 per head. So much for Obama's ' cost estimates' Needless to say, the new CBO cost figures are nothing like those promised by President Obama and Democrats when they were pushing the measure as a bill in 2009 and 2010. The figures are astounding: It will take $1.993 trillion to hand out insurance subsidies to poor and middle class Americans, as well as to finance a huge expansion of Medicaid and CHIP, or Children's Health Insurance Program, costs. It is, without question, the largest wealth redistribution effort in a generation. To 'offset' those costs, the government will take in only $643 billion in new taxes, fees and penalties related to the Affordable Care Act. Part of that revenue will include the first-ever set of escalating financial penalties -- or, as the Supreme Court defined them, taxes -- on Americans who don't buy a product, in this case health insurance . The revenue also includes a new tax on medical devices, which is actually opposed by both Republicans and some Democrats in Congress (meaning, if this provision is finally repealed, then costs per newly insured person will be even higher). In an address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, Obama promised that his signature legislation would not cost this much. In fact, he said, 'the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years' (which is still more than the government is raising to 'pay' for it, but that's a separate issue). 'It would be a significant discount if the White House could return to that number today,' the Mail reported. In the same 2009 speech, Obama made the claim that there were 'more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get [health insurance] coverage.' Using Obama's cost figure of $900 billion, and 30 million who needed coverage, the price tag would still have been hefty -- $30,000 per head -- but not as hefty. That would be only about two-thirds of what the CBO now says the program will cost per insured. The nonpartisan congressional agency, along with the Joint Committee on Taxation -- a group of lawmakers from both chambers of Congress -- prepared the report, which was released Jan. 26, showing the overall direction of the federal budget. The report estimates that 'the net costs of the coverage provisions of the ACA will rise sharply as the effects of the act phase in from 2015 through 2017,' a period when Obama will be preparing to leave office. Millions will still be uninsured Further, costs will 'rise steadily through 2022' before leveling off for three years, economists for the two groups estimated. But, even then, the Obamacare program is expected to add an additional $145 billion in costs each year to a federal budget that is constantly in the red, adding to a federal debt that now has surpassed $18 trillion, or more than a year's worth of U.S. GDP. As the Mail further noted: That number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans -- only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees. The final insult is that, according to the CBO, there will still be 'between 29 million and 31 million' non-elderly Americans without medical insurance -- meaning this entire mammoth law was literally passed for nothing (except, perhaps, to give more centralized control over Americans' lives to Washington).

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Frequent flushing of the face is the most noticeable symptom in the earliest stage of rosacea. This common skin condition is pronounced 'roh -zay-sha' and in the US, the number of sufferers is as high as 20 million including such well known people as previous President Bill Clinton, Prince Harry, Renee Zellweger, Cameron Diaz and the late Princess Diana. Rosacea has four recognized stages and each stage has different signs and symptoms, all of which affect the face. Rosacea is more common in female adults with a fair skin between the ages of 30 and 60. When males do have the condition, the symptoms can be more severe. There is no need to use harsh over-the-counter products that contain ingredients such as acids, alcohol and other irritants so they may actually worsen the rosacea condition. The goals of treatment are to control the condition and improve the appearance of your skin. Treatments are more effective the earlier they commence. Natural products including those formulated from essential oils can be used successfully and gently to eliminate the symptoms as well as the appearance of rosacea. The first stage is pre-rosacea where the main symptom is frequent flushing affecting the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin. The skin can become so sensitive that a burning sensation may occur when cosmetics or creams are applied. The face may even become swollen. Triggers are a strong factor and while these vary from person to person, they can be emotional, chemical, environmental or even food related. In time the tendency to flush or blush easily will progress to a more persistent redness. This is caused by the dilation of blood vessels, close to your skin's surface, in the central portion of the face, particularly the nose. Many sufferers will start to feel self conscious so you can add depression, low self-esteem and embarrassment to the problem. The second stage is vascular rosacea when small blood vessels on the nose and cheeks swell, showing through the skin as small red lines. The skin will feel warm and look puffy, becoming even more sensitive. Flushing and redness become more persistent and then permanent. The third stage is inflammatory rosacea where small, red bumps (some containing pus) may appear and persist. These may become painful and spread across the face . In severe cases, there is a build up of tissue on and around the nose particularly in men. Eventually, the nose may become red, enlarged and bulbous. The final stage is ocular rosacea which is a serious condition affecting the eyes that needs to be seen by an ophthalmologist as it could lead to the loss of vision. The symptoms (in conjunction with rosacea) are irritation in the eyes, light sensitivity, a decrease in visual ability and an obvious inflammation of the lids or conjunctivitis. In addition to starting a course of natural treatment, you can help by avoiding anything which you think might trigger a flare up. Keep a diary of such flare ups so that you can identify what might be a cause whether it is food, skin products you use, the weather or your emotions. For your part you can: - Protect your face from the sun in the summer or the cold in winter. - Avoid touching or rubbing the skin on your face. - Check the ingredients of any skin products you might use on your face to clean or moisturize. They should all contain 100% natural ingredients. - All make-up used on your face should also be 100% natural. With sensible care and treatment, you can overcome this problem to diminish the symptoms of rosacea. It just takes some time and effort.

0," The American people appear to be getting increasingly more unaware of their surroundings, and this is particularly evidenced in the number of pedestrians that are now getting injured or killed as a result of wandering into traffic. A CBS 2 New York report explains how one New Jersey town is actually now ticketing careless pedestrians who wander across streets and into traffic as a result of texting or talking on their cell phones. You have probably seen a few of them in your own town, those individuals who roam down sidewalks with their heads down as they peer at their smart phone screens. Many of these individuals approach intersections and crosswalks without even looking up, as they proceed to walk right out into traffic without so much as a glance upwards to see if a car or truck is approaching. 'They're not alert and they're not watching what they're doing,' said Thomas Ripoli, Chief of Police in Fort Lee, New Jersey, about the disturbing amount of people who are so engrossed in mobile phone life that they have no idea what is going on around them. His town has witnessed at least 23 pedestrian accidents just since January, three of which resulted in deaths. 'As of now, [police officers] are to give summonses to pedestrians who do not adhere to crosswalks and the lights.' When the people become too stupid to handle their own affairs, the state takes over Fort Lee is not the only place, of course, where careless pedestrians are causing problems -- all across America, an increasing dependance on mobile phones is changing the way people live, act, and behave in public. Common courtesy and reasonable awareness of one's surroundings have been sacrificed on the altar of convenience and technological dependency, which, naturally, is changing the way law enforcement treats citizens. You see, when stupidity takes over, chaos ensues. And when chaos becomes the norm, local law enforcement feel the need to step in and begin punishing people for their stupidity, which leads to increasing oppression and assumptions that individuals are guilty until proven innocent. And though this type of police abuse is never justified, societal degradation is one of the reasons why it continues to escalate. For freedom and liberty to persist, in other words, the People must step up and once again claim their God-given right to personal responsibility and 'self-policing.' When the People relinquish this responsibility, even with things as simple as walking down the street in a responsible way, the police state grows and becomes more oppressive. In the end, the People end up losing all their rights as a result of their own failure to live responsibly. "
0," Increasingly, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is being put to the test by Western scientists -- and the results are sometimes not only successful but downright astounding. A case in point: a new review of CHM research by British scientists just published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews shows treating endometriosis with Chinese herbs may not only relieve symptoms of the disease, CHM appears to have comparable benefits to drugs and even laparoscopic surgery with fewer adverse effects. This is important news because endometriosis is a huge problem in the US and Western medicine has yet to come up with any viable treatment that doesn't have serious side effects. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), at least 5.5 million women in North America alone have the disorder and 30 to 40 percent of them are infertile. A condition that causes tissue that normally lines the uterus to grow on the ovaries, bowels, and bladder, behind the uterus or elsewhere, endometriosis often produces debilitating pain that can keep a woman from going to work or school and put enormous strains on relationships. Endometriosis commonly causes severe cramps during menstrual periods, excessive bleeding during periods, chronic pelvic discomfort that can spread to the lower back and pain during or after sex. The cause of endometriosis remains unknown so doctors tend to treat it with prescription pain medications, hormones that can have devastating masculizing effects and even surgery to remove the endometrial growths. In some cases, doctors remove a woman's reproductive organs to try to reduce pain. As the Cochrane review points out, however, surgery doesn't always lead to long-term improvement in symptoms and drug treatments can cause a host of new problems such as hot flushes, acne and weight gain. The new study is the first English language systematic review of CHM for the treatment of endometriosis . The researchers analyzed, in particular, two trials of 158 women. In one clinical trial, therapy with Chinese herbs provided a reduction of symptoms that was comparable to the relief provided by the hormone medication gestrinone . However, the herbs, unlike the drug, caused few side effects. In the second trial, CHM was even more successful in treating endometriosis than the hormonal drug danazol . Once again, the Chinese herbs produced far fewer side effects than the Western medication. 'These findings suggest that Chinese herbs may be just as effective as certain conventional drug treatments for women suffering from endometriosis, but at present we don't have enough evidence to generalize the results,' said lead researcher Andrew Flower of the Complementary Medicine Research Unit at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom in a statement to the media. A growing number of scientists are actively studying the efficacy of CHM for other conditions, as well. For example, as reported previously in selfnews, researchers have found Chinese herbs can relieve menstrual cramps better than drugs ( http://www.selfnews.com/022969_menstrual_... ) and CHM may also be a successful treatment for type 2 diabetes ( http://www.selfnews.com/024051_diabetes_b... ). Earlier this year, scientists reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that Chinese herbs appear to help asthma patients, too.

0," It has come to our attention that the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), a national non-governmental organization that claims to represent the interests of American farmers, is right now attempting to covertly eliminate the freedom of South Carolina farmers to sell raw milk at the retail level. One of only a few states that currently recognizes the freedom of individuals to buy and sell raw milk legally, South Carolina is basically being accosted by this Big Ag front group, which will attempt to eliminate raw milk freedom in the Palmetto State at a special meeting to be held on Friday, January 25, 2013, at 12:00 pm. According to an insider alert we just received, the South Carolina Dairy Advisory Committee (SCDAC) will consider a proposal made by AFBF, which is strongly and vocally opposed to individuals having the freedom to buy and sell raw milk, to eliminate an existing state statute that recognizes the freedom of South Carolina farmers who are properly permitted to sell raw milk at the retail level. In its place, AFBF wants SCDAC to implement policies that reflect its own biased views towards raw milk, which for all intents and purposes would ban the sale of raw milk for human consumption throughout the state. 'Delegates approved a new policy that states only pasteurized milk and milk products should be sold for human consumption,' states the heinous proposal that AFBF is pushing SCDAC to adopt. 'Delegates approved the measure in light of the potential risks to public health and food safety posed by consumption of raw milk.' Science reveals raw milk is safe Based on AFBF's track record of lobbying, it is hardly surprising that the organization would side with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in clinging to a completely unscientific and outdated view of raw milk safety. After all, AFBF is the same organization that back in 2012 aggressively opposed reasonable restrictions that would have limited the use of antibiotics in factory-farmed animals, erroneously claiming that doing so would somehow negatively affect public health (when quite the opposite is true). Now, AFBF is making similar inaccurate claims with its surreptitious attack on raw milk in South Carolina. Based on data published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), raw milk is linked, at most, to causing only 42 sicknesses nationwide every year. And most of these cases cannot definitively be linked to raw milk -- they are merely assumed to be the cause of illness, as the government has a unabashed and completely irrational bias against raw milk. But even if all 42 of these annual cases could be conclusively linked to raw milk, the overall risk associated with raw milk consumption would still be ridiculously low, as roughly 10 million Americans consume raw milk on a regular basis. The federal government's own data proves that Americans are 35 thousand times more likely to get sick from many other foods legally sold at grocery stores than they are from raw milk ( http://www.westonaprice.org/press/government-data-proves-raw-milk-safe ). Take Action Since the meeting takes place in less than 24 hours, it is crucial that the health freedom community band together as one to immediately oppose this assault on raw milk. selfnews readers are urged to contact both David Winkles, Jr., President and CEO of the South Carolina Farm Bureau , and Bob Stallman, President of AFBF, and urge them not to infringe on the freedom of South Carolinians to buy and sell raw milk. In your calls and emails, be sure to explain to these gentlemen that: 1) Raw milk is a safe food, rich in living enzymes and beneficial probiotic bacteria, that can actually improve health. People have been safely consuming raw milk for millennia, and many countries today allow raw milk sales without issue, including in Europe where raw milk vending machines can be spotted on street corners. 2) Scientific data supports the safety of raw milk that is properly regulated. 3) A movement away from regulated raw milk will adversely affect the citizens of South Carolina who rely on it for health. 4) If raw milk is made illegal, other potentially unsafe avenues like underground sales will quickly emerge, similar to what occurred during alcohol prohibition. You can contact David Winkles, Jr. at: dwinkles@scfb.org (803) 936-4211 You can contact Bob Stallman at: bstallman@fb.org Remember to be polite, but assertive, in your correspondence. With enough push-back, we can stop this blatant attack on raw milk from succeeding. But we must act now to show these bullies that we are paying attention, and that we will not succumb to their attempts to steal even more food freedom from Americans. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) No benefit exists in using the highly toxic drugs for eczema pushed by conventional medicine. Homeopathy has better results without the use of harmful products. A peer-reviewed journal reports that there is no reason to subject your children to life-threatening steroids for eczema. The report, published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine , documents a one-year study of one to sixteen year-old children with eczema. The children treated with homeopathy had equal or better results than those treated with corticosteroids. More intriguing is that those children whose conditions were worse at the beginning of the study had greater degrees of improvement with the homeopathic treatment. This is clearly a win-win for patients. Why would anyone choose potent drugs that can permanently damage health when there's another, safe option? When you add in the fact that homeopathically-treated children may fare better than those treated by conventional medicine, then it's inconceivable why any parent would consider putting a child at risk by treating eczema conventionally, when homeopathy is a safe option. Trial Methodology and Results The study, done in Germany, included both urban and rural subjects recruited between January 1998 and December 2000. Its focus was on patients' and doctors' perceptions of improvement, both in terms of the eczema itself and quality of life. The methodology was designed to reflect routine treatment. Questionnaires were filled out by both physicians and patients, or when necessary, by their parents at the beginning of the study, at six months, and again at 12 months. The study focused on subjective results, not clinical tests. As the authors noted, although clinical tests may show differences in children with eczema and asthma in a biomarker like immunoglobulin E, it doesn't have any bearing on the patient's well-being. Children included had to meet the following criteria: "
0," Tweet Low-level exposure to a banned but lingering pesticide appears to accelerate changes in the brain that can potentially lead to the onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms years or even decades before they might naturally develop. This finding, by researchers at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, was presented today at the 232nd national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society. The concept of an accelerated disease process is a new twist in the investigation of the long-suspected link between the use of pesticides and Parkinson's disease, according to the researchers. 'Our current study clearly shows that pesticides such as dieldrin appear to accelerate or exacerbate the already underlying disease,' said Gary Miller, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at Emory University. 'Pesticides aren't necessarily the causative agents, but they do promote Parkinson's. So it appears the more you are exposed to pesticides, the greater your risk of developing the disease earlier in life.' In their pilot study, Miller and his co-researchers -- Emory graduate student Jaime Hatcher and Georgia Tech Professor Kurt Pennell, Ph.D. -- found that levels of dieldrin, an organochlorine pesticide developed in the 1940s as an alternative to DDT, were three times higher in the brains of 14 people who had Parkinson's disease than in the brains of 12 people who didn't. Based on this finding, the researchers estimated the lifetime exposure levels of these people and extrapolated these levels to mice. They then exposed laboratory mice to low, but 'environmentally relevant' dosages of dieldrin - about 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram. After one month, although none of the mice showed symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the researchers did detect increased levels of oxidative stress in the brain and significantly reduced uptake of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the development of Parkinson's. This latest work adds more evidence establishing a link between pesticides and Parkinson's. Earlier this year, a Harvard School of Public Health study of more than 140,000 adults found that those exposed to long-term, low levels of pesticides had a 70 percent higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. Another recent study, by the same Emory/Georgia Tech team, found that fetal rodents exposed to dieldrin had brain alterations that made them more susceptible to Parkinson's-inducing toxins. 'All of the evidence that has been accumulating suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of Parkinson's disease,' Miller said. 'We believe that a person who is destined to get Parkinson's because of genetics or other factors at age 80 might develop symptoms when they're 65 or 70 if they have been exposed to pesticides.' Dieldrin, which was most commonly used to control agricultural pests and termites, was banned for most uses by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1974 after it was found to be harmful to fish and other wildlife. It was totally banned in 1987. Although no longer used, dieldrin can persist in the environment for decades and move up through the food chain, particularly in dairy products and meats, to humans, Pennell said. Over the next few decades, however, dieldrin and other banned pesticides should dissipate in the environment and become less of a factor in the development of Parkinson's disease, according to Miller. 'Today, people are being exposed to much lower levels of pesticides than people were 30 or 40 years ago,' Miller said. 'I would predict that over the course of the next several decades that we will see a decrease in the incidence of Parkinson's disease.' At least 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease and about 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The disease occurs when certain nerve cells die or become impaired and can no longer produce dopamine.

0," Prepare to have your world rocked. What you're about to read here will leave you astonished, inspired and outraged all at the same time. You're about to be treated to some little-known information demonstrating why seasonal flu vaccines are utterly worthless and why their continued promotion is based entirely on fabricated studies and medical mythology. If the whole world knew what you're about to read here, the vaccine industry would collapse overnight. This information comes to you courtesy of a brilliant article published in The Atlantic (November 2009). The article, written by Shannon Brownlee and Jeanne Lenzer, isn't just brilliant; in my opinion it stands as the best article on flu vaccines that has ever been published in the popular press. Entitled Does the vaccine matter? , it presents some of the most eye-opening information you've probably ever read about the failure of flu vaccines. You can read the full article here: http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownl... Perhaps its impressive narrative shouldn't be too surprising, though, since writer Shannon Brownlee is also the celebrated author of a phenomenal book on modern medicine entitled Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer ( http://www.amazon.com/Overtreated-Medicine-M... ) ( http://www.naturalpedia.com/book_Overtreated... ). While I've never done this before, I'm going to summarize this article point by point (along with some comments) so that you get the full force of what's finally been put into print. This information is so important that I encourage you to share the following summary I've put together. Email it to family, friends and coworkers. Or post it on your blog or website (with a link and proper credit to both selfnews and The Atlantic , please). Get this information out to the world. People need to know this , and so far the mainstream media has utterly failed to make this information known. (The really good information begins after around a dozen bullet points, so be sure to keep reading...) Does the vaccine matter? What follows is my point-by-point summary of this groundbreaking article by Shannon Brownlee, originally published in The Atlantic. My opinion statements are shown in brackets and italics. Vaccination is the core strategy of the U.S. government's plan to combat the swine flu. The U.S. government has spent roughly $3 billion stockpiling vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The CDC is recommending that 159 million Americans receive a swine flu vaccine injection (as soon as possible). What if vaccines don't work? More and more researchers are skeptical about whether they do. Seasonal flu (that's the regular flu) currently kills an estimated 36,000 people each year in the United States. [But most people who die are already suffering from existing diseases such as asthma.] Most 'colds' aren't really caused by the flu virus. As few as 7 or 8 percent (and at most, 50 percent) of colds have an influenza origin. There are more than 200 viruses and pathogens that can cause 'influenza-like' illnesses (and therefore be easily mistaken for the flu). Viruses mutate with amazing speed, meaning that each year's circulating influenza is genetically different from the previous year. The vaccine for each upcoming flu season is formulated by health experts taking a guess [a wild guess, at times] about what strain of influenza might be most likely to circulate in the future. The 1918 Spanish Flu infected roughly one-third of the world population and killed at least 40 million. In the U.S., the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology predicted that H1N1 influenza could infect up to one-half of the U.S. population and kill 90,000 Americans. [Keep reading, the good part is coming...] Of those who have died from the Swine Flu in the U.S., roughly 70 percent were already diseased with some serious underlying condition such as asthma or AIDS. Public health officials consider vaccines to be their first and best weapon against influenza. Vaccines helped eradicate smallpox and polio. [I don't agree with that assessment. Vaccines did relatively little compared to improvements in public sanitation.] Each year, 100 million Americans get vaccinated, and vaccines remain 'a staple' of public health policy in the United States. RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Why the research is bogus Because researchers can't exactly pin down who has influenza and who doesn't, the research conducted on the effectiveness of vaccines simply calculates the death rate from all causes among those who take the vaccine vs. those who don't. [This includes deaths from accidents, heart attacks, medications, car wrecks and everything.] These studies show a 'dramatic difference' between the death rates of those who get the vaccines vs. those who don't. People who get vaccinated have significantly lower death rates [from ALL causes, and herein lies the problem...] . Flu shot propaganda cites these studies, telling people that if they get their flu shots every year, they will have a significantly reduced chance of dying. But this is extremely misleading... Critics question the logic of these studies: As it turns out, compared to the number of deaths from all causes, the number of people killed by influenza is quite small . According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, deaths from influenza account for -- at most -- 10 percent of the total deaths during the flu season (and this includes all indirect deaths aggravated by the flu). This brings up a hugely important dilemma: If influenza only accounts for roughly 10 percent of all deaths during the flu season, how could an influenza vaccine reduce total deaths by 50 percent? (As is claimed by the vaccine manufacturers.) [It doesn't add up. Even if the vaccines were 100% effective, they should only reduce the total death rates by 10%, given that only 10% of the total deaths are caused by influenza.] Here's a direct quote from the story: Tom Jefferson, a physician based in Rome and the head of the Vaccines Field at the Cochrane Collaboration, a highly respected international network of researchers who appraise medical evidence, says: 'For a vaccine to reduce mortality by 50 percent and up to 90 percent in some studies means it has to prevent deaths not just from influenza, but also from falls, fires, heart disease, strokes, and car accidents. That's not a vaccine, that's a miracle. ' [Emphasis added.] The failure of cohort studies So how do the vaccine companies come up with this '50% reduction in death rate' statistic? Through cohort studies. Cohort studies compare the death rates of large groups of people who received the vaccine to large groups of people who did NOT receive the vaccine. But there's a fatal flaw in this approach: People self-select for vaccinations . And what kind of people? As it turns out: People who take more precautions with their health! [Thus, you automatically have a situation where the more health-cautious people are getting the vaccines because they THINK it's good for them. Meanwhile all the masses of people who don't give a darn about their health tend to skip the seasonal flu vaccines. And these people tend to not take very good of their health in lots of other ways. In other words, in terms of the masses, people who get vaccines are more likely to avoid junk food and live a more health-cautious lifestyle. This explains the differences in the death rates between the two groups! It has nothing to do with the vaccine...] There is extreme 'cult-like' peer pressure put on doctors and researchers to swallow the vaccine mythology without question. Quoted from the story: Lisa Jackson, a physician and senior investigator with the Group Health Research Center, in Seattle, began wondering aloud to colleagues if maybe something was amiss with the estimate of 50 percent mortality reduction for people who get flu vaccine, the response she got sounded more like doctrine than science. 'People told me, 'No good can come of [asking] this,'' she says. ''Potentially a lot of bad could happen' for me professionally by raising any criticism that might dissuade people from getting vaccinated, because of course, 'We know that vaccine works.' This was the prevailing wisdom.' [In other words, don't dare question the vaccine, and don't ask tough scientific questions because the vaccine industry runs on dogma, not science... and if you ask any questions, you might find yourself out of a job...] . [Here's where the really good part begins...] Lisa Jackson was not deterred. She and three other researchers began to study the widely-quoted vaccine statistics in an attempt to identify this 'healthy user effect,' if any. They looked through eight years of medical data covering 72,000 people aged 65 or older and recorded who received flu shots and who didn't. Then they compared the death rates for all causes outside the flu season . The vaccine made no difference in mortality What she found blows a hole right through the vaccination industry: She found that even outside the flu season, the death rate was 60 percent higher among those who did not get vaccines than among those who do. [In other words, even when you take the flu season completely out of the equation, elderly people who don't get vaccines have other lifestyle factors that makes them far more likely to die from lots of other causes.] She also found that this so-called 'healthy user effect' explains the entire apparent benefit that continues to be attributed to vaccines . This finding demonstrates that the flu vaccine may not have any beneficial effect whatsoever in reducing mortality. How well done were these particular studies? Quoted from the story: Jackson's papers 'are beautiful,' says Lone Simonsen, who is a professor of global health at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., and an internationally recognized expert in influenza and vaccine epidemiology. 'They are classic studies in epidemiology, they are so carefully done.' Many pro-vaccine experts simply refused to believe the results of this study [because it conflicts with their existing belief in vaccine mythology] . The Journal of the American Medical Association refused to publish her research, even stating, 'To accept these results would be to say that the earth is flat!' [Which just goes to show you how deeply ingrained the current vaccine mythology is in the minds of conventional medical practitioners. They simply cannot imagine that vaccines don't work, so they dismiss any evidence -- even GOOD evidence -- demonstrating that fact. This is what makes the vaccine industry a CULT rather than a science.] Jackson's papers were finally published in 2006, in the International Journal of Epidemiology . [And here's the really, really juicy part you can't miss...] Vaccine shortage proves it never worked in the first place The history of the flu vaccine reveals some huge gaps in current vaccination mythology, essentially proving they don't work: For example: In 2004, vaccine production was low and there was a shortage in vaccines (a 40 percent reduction in vaccinations). And yet mortality rates did not rise during the flu season. [Clearly, if vaccines actually worked, then a year when the vaccine wasn't even administered to 40% of the people who normally get it should have resulted in a huge and statistically significant increase in mortality. It should have spiked the death rates and filled the morgues... but it didn't. You know why? Because flu vaccines don't work in the first place.] In the history of flu vaccines, there were two years in which the formulated flu vaccine was a total mismatch to the widely-circulating influenza that made people sick. These years were 1968 and 1997 . In both of these years, the vaccine was a completely mismatch for the circulating virus. In effect, nobody was vaccinated! [Knowing this, if the vaccine itself was effective at reducing death rates, then we should have once again seen a huge spike in the death rates during these two years, right? Seriously, if the vaccine reduces death rates by 50% as is claimed by vaccine manufacturers, then these two years in which the vaccine completely missed the mark should have seen huge spikes in the winter death rates, right? But what really happened was... nothing. Not a blip. Not a spike. Nothing. The death rates didn't rise at all.] If vaccines really worked to save lives, then the more people you vaccinate, the lower death rates you should see, right? But that's not the case . Back in 1989, only 15 percent of over-65 people got vaccinated against the flu. But today, thanks to the big vaccine push, over 65 percent are vaccinated. And yet, amazingly, death rates among the elderly have not gone down during the flu season. In fact, they've gone up! When vaccine promoters (and CDC officials) are challenged about the '50 percent mortality reduction' myth, they invoke dogmatic language and attack the messenger. They are simply not willing to consider the possibility that flu vaccines simply don't work. Scientists who question the vaccine mythology are routinely shunned by the medical establishment. Tom Jefferson from the Cochrane Collaboration is an epidemiologist who questions the claimed benefits of flu vaccines. 'The reaction [against Jefferson] has been so dogmatic and even hysterical that you'd think he was advocating stealing babies' said a colleague (Majumdar). Jefferson is one of the world's best-informed researchers on the flu vaccine. He leads a team of researchers who have examined hundreds of vaccine studies. To quote directly from the article: The vast majority of the studies were deeply flawed, says Jefferson. 'Rubbish is not a scientific term, but I think it's the term that applies [to these studies].' [And here's the real kicker that demonstrates why flu vaccines are useless...] Flu vaccines only 'work' on people who don't need them Vaccines supposedly 'work' by introducing a weakened viral strain that causes the immune system to respond by building influenza antibodies. However, as Jefferson points out, only healthy people produce a good antibody response to the vaccine . And yet it is precisely the unhealthy people -- the ones who have a poor immune response to the vaccine -- who are most at risk of being harmed or killed by influenza. But the vaccines don't work in them! [In other words -- get this -- flu vaccines only 'work' in people who don't need them!] [At the same time, it's also accurate to say that vaccines don't work at all in the very people who theoretically could benefit from them. They only produce antibodies in people who already have such a strong immune response that they don't need the vaccine in the first place.] Jefferson has called for randomized, placebo-controlled studies of the vaccines. But vaccine pushers are resisting these clinical trials! They call the trials 'unethical' [but, in reality, they know that a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study would reveal the complete failure of flu vaccines, and they will do anything to prevent such a trial from happening. Don't you find it amazing that drug pushers and vaccine advocates claim they have 'science' on their side, but they won't submit their vaccines to any real science at all?] [No placebo-controlled studies have ever been conducted on flu vaccines because the industry says they would be 'unethical.' So where do these people get off claiming their vaccines work at all? The whole industry is based on fabricated statistics that are provably false... and the injections continue, year after year, with absolutely no benefit to public health whatsoever...] Why anti-viral drugs don't work either On the anti-viral drug front, hospitals are urged to hand out prescriptions for Tamiflu and Relenza to almost anyone who is symptomatic, whether they actually have swine flu or not. Concern is growing about the emergence of drug-resistant strains of swine flu. ' Flu can become resistant to Tamiflu in a matter of days...' says one researcher. In 2005, the U.S. government spent $1.8 billion to stockpile antiviral drugs for the military. This decision was made during the time when Donald Rumsfeld was Defense Secretary. Rumsfeld also held millions of dollars worth of stock in Gilead Sciences , the company that holds the patent on Tamiflu. That company saw its stock price rise 50 percent following the government's stockpiling purchase of Tamiflu. The evidence supporting Tamiflu's anti-viral benefits is flimsy at best. Even worse, as many as one in five children taking Tamiflu experience neuropsychiatric side effects including hallucinations and suicidal behavior. [In other words, your kid might be 'tripping out' on some bad Tamiflu...] Tamiflu is already linked to 50 deaths of children in Japan. The evidence supporting Tamiflu is based on cohort studies , just like the vaccines, which may distort or exaggerate the apparent benefits of the drug. Even supporters of Tamiflu admit it's never been proven to help. A CDC official says that randomized trials to determine the effectiveness of Tamiflu would be 'unethical.' In all, neither vaccines nor anti-viral drugs have any reliable evidence that they work against influenza at all. Both are being promoted based entirely on pure wishful thinking, not hard science. The history of pharmaceutical medicine is littered with other examples of drugs that doctors 'knew worked' but which later turned out to harm or kill patients. [All along, the proper scientific studies were avoided because, hey, if you already know everything, why bother conducting any actual science to prove anything?] The hype about vaccines provides a false sense of security, taking away attention from other things that really do work to prevent influenza deaths. That's why, except for 'hand washing,' virtually no advice has been offered to the public on preventing influenza beyond vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Concluding quote from the author: 'By being afraid to do the proper studies now, we may be condemning ourselves to using treatments based on illusion and faith rather than sound science.' A recap of these astonishing points Let's recap what we just learned here (because it's just mind-boggling): There have been no placebo-controlled studies on flu vaccines because the vaccine pushers say such clinical trials would be 'unethical.' Thus, there is actually no hard scientific evidence that they work at all. The '50 percent reduction in mortality' statistic that's tossed around by vaccine pushers is a total fabrication based on 'rubbish' studies ('cohort' studies). Scrutinizing the existing studies that claim to support vaccines reveals that flu vaccines simply don't work . And when vaccines aren't available or the formulation is wrong, there's no spike in death rates, indicating quite conclusively that these vaccines offer no reduction in mortality. Flu vaccines only produce antibodies in people who don't need vaccines. At the same time, they fail to produce antibodies in people who are most vulnerable to flu. Thus, vaccines only work in people who don't need them. The entire flu vaccine industry is run like a cult, with dogma ruling over science. Anyone who asks tough, scientific questions is immediately branded a heretic. No one is allowed to question the status quo. (So much for 'evidence-based medicine,' huh?) As you can see from all this, the flu vaccine is pure quackery . Those who administer vaccines are, by inference, QUACKS. They claim to have scientific minds, and yet they are the most gullible of all: They will believe almost anything if it's published in a medical journal , even if it's complete quackery. Today, countless doctors, nurses and pharmacists across North America and around the world are pushing a medically worthless, scientifically-fabricated chemical injection that offers absolutely no benefit to public health... and yet they're convinced it's highly effective! It just goes to show you how easy it is to brainwash people in the field of conventional medicine. They've abandoned real science long ago, you know. Now the whole industry is just run on the momentum of dogmatic arrogance and the illusion of authority. From the CDC and FDA on down to the local pharmacist at the corner store, the American medical system is run by some seemingly smart people who have been brainwashed into become full-fledged members of the Cult of Pharmacology where vaccine mythology overrules real science. The vaccine industry is perhaps the greatest medical scam ever pulled off in the history of the world. Don't fall for it. And don't forget to read the full article in The Atlantic by Shannon Brownlee: http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200911/brownl... Why people get vaccinated: Superstition Reading everything you've read here, you might wonder: Why do people get vaccinated at all? The reason is because no one knows whether they work or not , so people keep on taking them 'just in case.' It's exactly the kind of superstitious ritual that 'science-minded skeptics' rail against on a regular basis... unless, of course, it involves their vaccines, in which case superstition is all okay. People take vaccines for the same reason they rub a rabbit's foot. It's a good luck ritual that may or may not work, but no one really knows. And besides, what's the harm in it? (They think...) Personally, I'd rather get some vitamin D and have a healthy, functioning immune system. But for those who prefer to play the lotto, gamble in Vegas or bet their lives on medical superstitions, flu vaccines are readily available. So what are you waiting for? Shoot up a few flu vaccines, rub your lucky rabbit's foot, then spin around clockwise seven times and you, too, may be able to generate enough luck to avoid the flu this winter. "
0," The digital age has not been kind to privacy, as both government and private-sector institutions and corporations have used electronic social media communications and interactions for self-interested purposes, and without our permission. Social media giant Facebook is in hot water again for this very thing. The company has been outed for manipulating users' news feeds in order to gauge their responses and actions. According to Bloomberg News , news feeds were distorted on more than 700,000 users' pages, once again raising privacy concerns at a time when millions are still fuming over revelations that the National Security Agency has been collecting metadata on virtually everyone everywhere at all times: The number of positive and negative comments that users saw on their feeds of articles and photos was altered in January 2012, according to a study published June 17 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . People shown fewer positive words were found to write more negative posts, while the reverse happened with those exposed to fewer negative posts, according to the trial of random Facebook users. Secretive manipulation Facebook data scientist Adam Kramer, one of the study's authors, wrote on his own page recently that the research team was 'very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused.' Bloomberg News reported that the data gathered by the team showed that online messages influenced users' 'experience of emotions,' which could then affect their offline behavior. Some Facebook users turned to another social media giant, Twitter, to complain that the research was a breach of privacy. 'Facebook knows it can push its users' limits, invade their privacy, use their information and get away with it,' said James Grimmelmann, a professor of technology and the law at the University of Maryland. 'Facebook has done so many things over the years that scared and freaked out people.' In a later blog post at The Laboratorium , Grimmelmann added: 'The unwitting participants in the Facebook study were told (seemingly by their friends) for a week either that the world was a dark and cheerless place or that it was a saccharine paradise. That's psychological manipulation, even when it's carried out automatically.' The Guardian reported that the study was conducted in conjunction with academics from Cornell and the University of California: Facebook filtered users' news feeds -- the flow of comments, videos, pictures and web links posted by other people in their social network. One test reduced users' exposure to their friends' 'positive emotional content', resulting in fewer positive posts of their own. Another test reduced exposure to 'negative emotional content' and the opposite happened. The easy fix: Cancel your account 'Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks,' study authors concluded. At least one British Member of Parliament (MP) is calling for an investigation into how Facebook and other social media companies manipulate emotional and psychological responses of users by providing them with select content. 'This is extraordinarily powerful stuff and if there is not already legislation on this, then there should be to protect people,' MP Jim Sheridan, a member of the Commons media select committee, said in describing the research as intrusive. 'They are manipulating material from people's personal lives and I am worried about the ability of Facebook and others to manipulate people's thoughts in politics or other areas,' he said. 'If people are being thought-controlled in this kind of way there needs to be protection and they at least need to know about it.' The best solution to this kind of secretive eavesdropping and manipulation is to put social media sites like Facebook out of business by canceling your account. Until consumers begin hitting these companies in the pocketbook, the social experimentation at the expense of consumers won't end. This kind of stuff is not okay when the government does it. Why is it permissible when it's a private corporation? Sources: http://www.bloomberg.com http://www.usatoday.com http://www.theguardian.com http://laboratorium.net "
0," A St. Louis weight loss instructor is suing Cola-Cola over their 'My Coke Rewards' program. Julia Harvey says the program could persuade children to drink hazardous quantities of the product. The program rewards Coca-Cola consumers with points for each product they buy, which can be redeemed for prizes such as free vacations. The problem, Harvey says, is that the contest ends in January, and a Coke drinker would have to consume more than 100 cans a day to obtain enough points for some of the prizes. Harvey's lawyer, Albert Watkins, says, 'You will die before you can consume all those products.' The suit was brought against the famous beverage brand out of a sense of moral obligation, according to Harvey, who is not seeking monetary compensation. Instead she wants a permanent injunction to force the company to drop the campaign. She said she would also drop the suit if Coca-Cola altered or dropped their promotion voluntarily, restricted it to adults, or changed the advertising to highlight the fact that consumers do not have to drink the beverage to get points. Scott Williamson, spokesman for Coca-Cola, called the lawsuit 'frivolous and ridiculous.' He says that customers also can obtain points a number of other ways, including sharing cases of Coca-Cola with friends or winning up to 50,000 points from online contests. He added that most of the prizes require fewer than 100 points and 99 percent require fewer than 5,000. According to Williamson, the company has no plans to alter its 'My Coke Rewards' promotion. Coca-Cola is the same company that once launched a, 'Just say no to H2O' campaign to discourage restaurant customers from drinking water. The program has since been abandoned as Coke rolled out its own water beverage product (Dasani). ### "
0," Gun control may be a hot topic, but what about water control? Recent comments from Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck imply that the world's water will soon come under the control of corporations like his. Brabeck makes the astonishing claim that water is not a human right, but should be managed by business people and governing bodies. He wants water controlled, privatized, and delegated in a way that sustains the planet. View the astonishing interview here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iGj4GpAbTM Water control hitting the United States All of this means that Brabeck's future plans include monitoring and controlling the amount of water people use. One day, cities and towns may be forced by international law to limit each household to a set amount of water. People may have to obtain permits to dig wells or pay fines for collecting rainwater. Laws like these are already in motion in the United States. Learn more here: http://www.selfnews.com/029286_rainwater_collection_water.html Nestle's CEO thinks all water should have a price In the interview, Brabeck touts that his company is the largest foodstuff corporation in the world with over $65 billion in profit each year. He proudly claims that millions of people are dependent on him and his company. Does this guy think he is a god? He calls water a 'foodstuff' that needs an assigned value. Who controls the price of water? Brabeck bases his sustainability projects on the fact that a third of the world's population may face water shortages within 15-20 years. By price controlling water, Brabeck believes he may save the planet from food and water shortages in the coming years. With the threat of future water shortages, is it necessary to strip all humans of their natural liberty to water, as Brabeck suggests? What might happen if international controls are placed on water sources as a select few corporate dictators rule over the water supply ? Can a free and thriving people find better ways to conserve and respect water with their own liberty, rather than allow global corporations to control it? Nestle CEO applauds GMO farming and criticizes organic practices Putting a person like Brabeck in control of water would create a tyrannical monopoly on something that was meant to be free. If influential corporations put a lock on the water tap, then they could dictate which farms received water. Nestle could protect GMO farming. In fact, in the interview, Brabeck said organic food is 'not the best' and he went on to say that genetically modified food is perfectly safe and causes no disease. With this philosophy, a Brabeck economy would cut off organic farming from the water supply and allow genetically modified food to reign over the people. Working together to preserve our right to water Free people everywhere must work together to preserve their natural right to water. If one wants to dig their own well and tap the ground water, so be it. They are responsible for their keep. If one wants to collect their own rain water to sustain their own garden, then so be it. If one wants to purify their own water trough charcoal gravity fed filters and ditch bottled water companies altogether, then they will be better off for doing so. Is it time to reject a bottled water industry that is brainwashing people to submit to price controlled water? Humans can self sustain and work together, managing their own water. Greedy corporate CEOs are not the answer. No one is dependent on them. Water should remain unadulterated, free and available as a right to all.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Can you eat the foods you love occasionally without compromising your health? A new study shows that adding certain compounds to your diet can protect you from the harmful effects of acrylamides found in many of American's favorite foods. As published in the July 15, 2008 edition of the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry , researchers found that three dietary constituents, tea polyphenols, resveratrol, and diallyl trisulfide, inhibit damage to DNA from acrylamides at levels typically found in human exposure. Results of analysis of the compounds with accelerator mass spectrometry demonstrated that all three significantly inhibited the formation of acrylamide damage to liver DNA, whereas tea polyphenols and diallyl trisulfide reduced DNA damage to protamines and hemoglobin as well. Further biochemical studies showed that acrylamides could significantly inactivate creatine kinase and glutathione S-transferase and deplete glutathione. When the inhibitors were treated with acrylamide, all of them could effectively recover the activities of creatine kinase. In addition, tea polyphenols and diallyl trisulfide could increase glutathione S-transferase at a remarkably high level. Creatine kinase is an enzyme essential in biochemical reactions and energy generation. Glutathione S-transferase is a family of enzymes that play key roles in the detoxification of substances such as carcinogens, drugs, and byproducts of oxidative stress. Acrylamides are formed when carbohydrate containing foods are baked, fried or roasted. They have been shown to cause cancer in animals exposed to high doses, as well as nerve damage. Acrylamides are not added to foods but occur naturally in the cooking process. Because of this, information on them is not required on food labels. Any starchy food cooked at high temperatures will contain acrylamides . Potatoes that are fried may be the worst offenders, with potato chips fried to a golden brown containing the highest levels. Boiled or mashed potatoes will contain acrylamides as will cooked sweet potatoes. It can also be found in toasted or roasted cereal grains and bread products -- again with the highest levels contained in those baked to a golden brown, and corn roasted on a grill, or popped in oil. Pretzels are promoted as healthy snacks, but that golden brown color is your tip that they contain high levels of acrylamides. Coffee creates acrylamides during its roasting. Acrylamides were discovered by Swedish scientists in 2002, and made headlines across America when they were first reported. Since then, there has been little interest by the FDA to keep people abreast of the dangers of eating acrylamide containing foods. The method by which acrylamides form in food remains unknown. What we do know from this study is that by taking steps to protect ourselves from acrylamides, we don't have to be boorish sticks when we go out with our friends. We can eat foods containing acrylamides without suffering their effects if we also make sure we are fortified with tea polyphenols, resveratrol and diallyl trisulfide. Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-cancer properties of tea polyphenols, with recent studies adding gastric, esophageal and skin cancers to the list of those inhibited by polyphenols from tea consumed in high amounts. Another study showed ovarian cancer risk reduced by 46 percent in women drinking 2 cups of tea daily. Researchers have found tea polyphenols to lower cholesterol levels, prevent blood clots, and help prevent heart disease. All types of tea contain polyphenols, with green and white tea having the highest levels due to their minimal processing. Resveratrol is turning out to be so good for us that red wine may end up on the superfood list. It is found in the skin of red or purple grapes, and in peanut products that contain the skins, such as Spanish peanuts. Resveratrol has also been shown to help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. A glass of tea or red wine during a meal containing foods that have produced acrylamides will offer you protection. Diallyl trisulfide is a compound found in garlic that has been roasted, smashed or otherwise processed. Shown particularly effective in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, this compound is also a potent immune system booster. All three of these compounds are extremely effective antioxidants. If you plan to be eating foods that contain acrylamides, you can protect yourself by having supplements of theses compounds on hand. Each offers an array of other health benefits.

0," Most Americans operate under the assumption that your thoughts are your own private business and that they cannot be used against you to forfeit your rights and freedoms. It's only actions that matter when it comes to being judged, right? Merely thinking something doesn't mean you're going to act on it, right? Enter Barack Obama and his 23 executive orders issued last week . (And don't forget New York mafia Governor Cuomo and his new ' psychiatric police ' law.) Suddenly merely thinking about doing something violent or dangerous can cause all your constitutional rights to be stripped away by the state. Here's how it works: If you're seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist and you say something that might be considered violent -- 'I can't stand my boss and I wish he would just die!' -- under Obama's executive orders the psychiatrist must now report you to the government as a possible danger to society. This is done in complete violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, of course. Once the government receives this information, it then conducts a raid on the home of the person in question, seizes his or her firearms, and places that person on a 'no gun buy' list maintained by the FBI, completely outside of law and due process. This isn't a bill being debated that might be passed into law -- this is in effect right now! This is what happens if you visit a psychiatrist tomorrow. And you can bet that every psychiatrist or psychologist will immediately report even the smallest hint of violent thinking to government authorities in order to avoid being blamed for NOT reporting that person if something violent happens. So now, with the stroke of a pen, Obama has transformed the entire industry of modern psychiatry into the thought police with Judge Dredd-like authority over your life. No judge, no jury, no due process: You are just GUILTY by decree It used to be that a judge had to declare you mentally incompetent in order to take away your constitutional rights. That process, found in the judicial branch of government , at least gave people the opportunity to present refuting evidence and in many cases even benefit from the help of legal counsel. But now all that has been stripped away in the idiotic, irrational reaction to the actions of one crazed person who murdered children at Sandy Hook. Now the executive branch of government has taken over the entire domain of mental health. Thanks to Obama's executive orders, you no longer have the right to the privacy of your own thoughts. There mere act of seeking professional help for anguish, or anger, or imbalanced emotions now makes you GUILTY of things you've never even done! ...gun owners who may reasonably or unreasonably think, 'I'm not going anywhere near a mental health person, because if they misinterpret something I say as an indication I'm going to hurt myself or someone else, they're going to report me and take away my guns,' said Paul Applebaum, director of the Division of Law, Ethics, and Psychiatry at Columbia University in an NBC News article . That story goes on to report: New York's expanded gun law signed by Cuomo on January 15 goes further than most state laws in that it requires mental health professionals to report any person considered 'likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others' to local health officials. Those officials would be authorized to report that person to law enforcement, which could seize the person's firearms. Psychiatrists have zero credibility to begin with The problem with all this is that this 'Judge Dredd' diagnosis is being made by the very same people who are steeped in an industry of fictitious diseases and disorders . When a psychiatrist witnesses an active, intelligent child, he sees Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. When a psychiatrist visits with a person who seems to be sad, he sees a deficiency of antidepressant drugs requiring immediate chemical intervention. How on earth are we supposed to trust these same people to observe someone sharing their most intimate, private thoughts and not leap to the conclusion that they might be a danger to society? Isn't it true that nearly everyone, at one time or another, has held angry thoughts about a coworker, a neighbor, a family member, an ex-intimate partner or some other member of society? What person on this planet has never experienced the thought of violence against some other person? So now we get to the real aim of all this: To criminalize everyone for completely normal human emotions and experiences. Now, the mere expression of anger will, itself, be 'diagnosed' as a mental disorder that automatically strips from you any and all rights as an American citizen. You can then be hauled off to the Obama gulag and held under indefinite detention as if you were an enemy combatant. After all, you might be a terrorist! And if you get angry about being arrested, then that only proves that you're a violent person, indeed! Of course, if your anger is only directed at gun owners, that's perfectly acceptable. You can say, right on national television, that you think we ought to shoot gun owners and murder their families, and this sort of speech will be widely applauded by the likes of Piers Morgan, Anderson Cooper and other CNN puppets of the new psychiatric police state that has been covertly erected around your mind while you were sleeping. What can you do? STOP visiting any and all psychiatrists and psychologists, period Your only defense against all this is to immediately stop visiting any and all psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors. They are now government snitches working for Obama. They're no longer advocates for you and your rights; they are thought police enforcers propping up a rapidly deteriorating police state. FACE IT: There is no more doctor-patient confidentiality in America. Your psychiatrist, if you're foolish enough to actually have one, is now part of the secret police network that reports to the Department of Homeland Security. (And yet you pay the bill.) This is not a conspiracy theory and it's not a scary warning about some possible dystopian future that might come true. This is here right now. This is in effect today, all across America. If you don't believe me, go visit a psychiatrist, explain that you sometimes (for example) imagine using hand grenades to blow up little children, and see how long it takes before you're swept away in a straight jacket and stripped of all your freedoms. You will be institutionalized within hours. This is it, folks: We have entered the era of thought crimes enforcement in America . And psychiatrists are the 'pre-crime' snitches who now wield the power of Judge Dredd over all your freedoms. Your emotions must now be identical to those expressed by the state All this is ripped right out of George Orwell's 1984 novel, where a citizen who held the wrong expression on his face during a government propaganda announcement was arrested as a suspected enemy of the state. When the state is happy, you must be happy. When the state is outraged (for example at all gun owners following the Sandy Hook shooting), you must mirror that outrage in your own words and expressions. When the state is pushing fear, you must act fearful. Just as in North Korea, when the dear leader dies, you must cry and sob on command, or you are thrown in the gulag. If your emotions run counter to the official emotions of the state, you are then deemed a danger to society. For example, if the state is happy about passing unconstitutional gun control restrictions but you are outraged at the government for doing so, this disparity in emotional status automatically makes you a danger to society, the government claims. You can be arrested, stripped of all your rights, and even 'indefinitely detained' under Obama's anti-humanitarian NDAA law . Children are now being suspended from school for pointing their fingers and imagining their fingers are guns . You know, as in the old-time children's imaginary game called 'Cops and robbers.' The crime, we are told, is in the imagining of a gun! Similarly, other children are now being thrust into school lockdowns and armed SWAT raids for the 'crime' of bringing a lime green toy Nerf gun to school. America has entered a phase of runaway delusional insanity. And remember, they've put the psychiatrists in charge . If this isn't the epitome of putting the mental patients in charge of the insane asylum, nothing is. Where this is headed Make no mistake, friends: This power is going to be abused to the extreme. Psychiatrists are going to wield this power against their political enemies (i.e. anyone who doesn't bow down to psychiatry). 'Mental disorders' are now going to be used as weapons to arrest selected people and lock them away in secret government gulags. The DSM-V 'psychiatry bible' will now be used as an encyclopedia of fabricated justifications to strip away human rights, civil rights and the Bill of Rights from anyone targeted by the system. When does it get even worse? When so-called 'mental health checks' for all citizens become mandated by the government. During all this, there will be absolutely no discussion allowed of the link between psychiatric drugs and violent behavior among school shooters. That's another inconvenient truth the government would prefer never be acknowledged. Merely mentioning this, in fact, might get you flagged with some sort of mental disorder. Finally, consider this: In a nation where the President is an imposter and the Vice President has, by anyone's honest reckoning, lost half his marbles, all those who seek power are the most insane people of all. They hate normalcy. They hate spirituality, ethics, dedication and hard work. They seek to destroy all those who represent that which is good in the universe, and they hope to infect our culture, our economy and our world with a web of cruel delusions. The sooner you recognize that, the better your chances of surviving it. "
0," The Pentagon has recently announced that it will be moving sensitive and important communications equipment to nuclear-hardened Cold War facilities to protect against electromagnetic pulse events that could occur naturally, from sun bursts, or from overhead detonations of a nuclear weapon. As reported by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the gear is being moved back to Cheyenne Mountain, a hardened base operated by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The facility scans for missile launches and aircraft entering U.S. airspace. The shift back to Cheyenne Mountain -- located in Colorado -- is not something that the Pentagon has undertaken on a whim; according to AFP, the Defense Department has inked a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to get the job done. Such decisions usually follow analyses based on intelligence estimates. In other words, if the Pentagon didn't feel it was necessary to move the sensitive comms back to Cheyenne Mountain, especially in an era of military budget cuts, the move wouldn't be made. 'I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there' The head of NORAD and Northern Command, Navy Adm. William Gortney, said that, 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney said in a question-and-answer session with reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. Cheyenne Mountain's bunker was carved into a mountain in the 1960s; it is a half-acre complex that is designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Inside the massive complex, Air Force personnel monitor airspace and are poised to send warnings that could potentially trigger a U.S. nuclear response. However, in 2006, the Defense Department moved NORAD and USNORTHCOM to Petersen Air Force Base in Colorado Springs; at the time, the Cheyenne facility was re-designated as an alternative communications site if needed. Somebody has obviously decided that, once again, it is needed. At the time that the center was moved to Petersen, officials said it was necessary as a means of boosting efficiency, even though hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of improvements and modernization at Cheyenne took place following the 9/11 attacks. Now, the Pentagon is moving back. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' one defense official told AFP. Concern about an EMP incident, either from a massive solar flare or due to an attack with nuclear weapons, has been an increasing concern among U.S. officials and lawmakers the past couple of years. In June 2013, we reported that a group of Republican lawmakers were pushing a plan to protect the nation's electrical infrastructure from an EMP attack or massive solar flare. EMP likelihood rising? A year later, Peter Vincent Pry , the executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security and director of the U.S. Nuclear Strategy Forum -- both of which are congressional advisory boards -- said improving our technology to avoid an EMP disaster was both financially feasible and extremely necessary in order to protect Americans. 'The problem is not the technology,' Pry said. 'We know how to protect against it. It's not the money, it doesn't cost that much. The problem is the politics. It always seems to be the politics that gets in the way.' 'If you do a smart plan -- the Congressional EMP Commission estimated that you could protect the whole country for about $2 billion,' Pry told Watchdog.org. 'That's what we give away in foreign aid to Pakistan every year.' He estimated that, within the first few minutes of an EMP incident, as many as 500,000 Americans could die. AFP further reported that Raytheon's work includes improvements to facilities at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) It's almost cold and flu season again. This is the time to make sure your immune system is up to the task of killing off invading germs, viruses and bacteria. A healthy, well-tuned immune system also vanquishes abnormal or degenerating cells before they can do any damage. One of the best ways to make sure your immune system is first rate is through the use of adaptogens, a group of substances that have nonspecific actions in the body and create minimal disruption while they normalize body functions. Two herbal pillars of Chinese medicine, astragalus and schisandra, are adaptogens rapidly gaining favor in the Western world. Walking on the tightrope You and your immune system do a constant balancing act as you walk the tightrope of life. Let your immune system weaken too much, and the door is opened to pathogens. Let it strengthen too much, and the result can be systemic inflammation, allergies and autoimmune disorders. Astragalus and schisandra function as balance beams to keep you perfectly centered on that tightrope. Astragalus is a 2000 year old healer Astragalus, known in Chinese medicine as Huang Qi, has been used for more than 2,000 years to strengthen vitality and stave off illnesses including colds and flu. Its growing popularity in the West may be due to extensive scientific study that began in the 1970's, documenting the ability of the herb to stimulate the immune system, fight bacteria and viruses, reduce inflammation and protect the liver. Astragalus is prescribed for shortness of breath, general body weakness, and poor appetite. It has diuretic properties and can be used to treat colds, flu, stomach ulcers, and diabetes. It supports and strengthens body resistance, invigorates, and promotes tissue regeneration. Recent research findings point to the conclusion that astragalus acts by augmenting white blood cells that fight disease, and clearing out aberrant cells that may create disease in the future. Astragalus is a perennial plant and a relative of the pea plant. It's native to the northern and eastern parts of China, Mongolia and Korea. It contains numerous nutritional components including flavonoids, polysaccharides, triterpene glycosides, saponins, amino acids, and trace minerals. Research documents the normalizing effects of astragalus on the body In a study reported in the Journal of Food and Medicine , September edition, researchers investigated the immune stimulating effects of astragalus through the innate effects of astragalus on pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by cultured macrophages. Astragalus was able to affect production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha when used in high concentrations. It was also able to modify responses from artificially stimulated macrophages, with identified immunomodulatory effects to reduce production of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner. Researchers concluded that astragalus exhibited ability to modulate macrophage responses during stimulation. These results underscore the adaptive, balancing qualities of astragalus. Other research conducted in the U.S. investigated astragalus as a treatment for people with compromised immune systems from chemotherapy or radiation. In these studies, astragalus supplements were shown to speed recovery and extend life expectancy. Studies performed at the National Cancer Institute and other leading Cancer Institutes in recent years have positively shown that astragalus strengthens cancer patients' immune systems, allowing them to recover significantly faster and live longer. Recent research in China reveals that astragalus offers antioxidant benefits to people with severe forms of heart disease by relieving symptoms and improving heart function. The Chinese have known for centuries that astragalus is a superior herb. In the West the benefits of this herb are beginning to be understood by allopaths. It is well accepted by naturopaths and holistic healers. How to use astragalus According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, astragalus may be given to children to support their immune systems if there is no fever present. The dose should be determined by adjusting the recommended adult dose to account for the weight of the child. The dose for an adult is calculated on a weight of 150 pounds. Therefore, if the child weighs 50 pounds, the appropriate dose of astragalus would be 1/3 of the adult dosage. Adult doses from 1 to 25 grams are used as follows: Decoction (strong boiled tea): 3-6 g of dried root per 12 oz water, three times per day Fluid extract (1:1) in 25% ethanol: 2-4 mL three times per day Powdered root: 500-1,000 mg three times a day Powered extract: 100 to 150 mg Tincture: (1:5) in 30% ethanol: 3-5 mL three times a day Astragalus has no side effects and can generally be used safely. It does interact with prescription drugs. Schisandra, another ancient adaptogen The Chinese name for schisandra means 'five-taste-fruit'. Its balancing affect includes the taste buds where it produces a mixture of sour, sweet, salty, hot, and bitter tastes. This herbal adaptogen improves vitality and promotes revitalization. It boosts the immune system , and enhances physical endurance and mental concentration. It soothes the nerves, reduces anxiety, and is said to promote radiant skin tone. Schisandra contains essential oils, acids and lignans that help regenerate liver tissue damaged by alcohol or hepatitis. One group of the lignans is therapeutic against oxidative neuronal damage induced by excito-toxins, making schisandra a supplement to use before consuming foods suspected of containing MSG or asparatame. The herb improves physical and mental performance, relieves fatigue, and strengthens and tones the body, particularly after exertion or disease. It promotes cellular oxygenation and potentiates the immune system through its beneficial effects on blood circulation. It is said to improve sexual performance for men and women. Schisandra is a research star The European Journal of Pharmacology , September edition, reports a study of schisandra's anti-inflammatory ability on plasma nitrate concentration in mice. Results indicated that induced paw edema and vascular permeability were inhibited by schisandra. The herb also had a protective effect on induced sepsis. This study is the first to show that the anti-inflammatory properties of schisandra result from the inhibition of nitric oxide production, prostaglandin release, and COX-2. A review of Russian research from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , July edition, reveals that schisandra was used as an adaptogen in the USSR in the early 1960's. It is included in the National Pharmacopoeia of the USSR and the State Register of Drugs. Animal studies in the USSR have shown that schisandra increases physical working capacity and affords a stress-protective affect against a broad spectrum of harmful factors including heat shock, skin burn, cooling, frostbite, immobilization, decreased air pressure, aseptic inflammation, irradiation, and heavy metal intoxication. Schisandra exerts an affect on several body systems including central nervous, sympathetic, endocrine, immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal. It is a blood sugar stabilizer and acid-alkaline balancer in the body. Studies on isolated organs, tissues, cells and enzymes have revealed that schisandra exhibits strong antioxidant activities and affects smooth muscles, arachidonic acid release, biosynthesis in leucocytes, platelet activating factor activity, carbohydrate-phosphorus metabolism, tissue respiration and oxygen consumption, and the tolerance of the body to oxygen intoxication. In healthy subjects, schisandra increases endurance and accuracy of movement, mental performance and working capacity. It generates alterations in the basal level of cortisol in blood and saliva with subsequent effects on the blood cells, vessels and central nervous system. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficiency of schisandra in dealing with psychiatric disorders such as neurosis, depression, schizophrenia, and alcolism. It is effective against influenza, chronic sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, allergic dermatitis, and stomach and duodenal ulcers. It has been used successfully in wound healing. How to use schisandra For use as a general tonic in China, patients are advised to chew dried schisandra berries daily for 100 days. Daily doses of schisandra supplements range from 1 to 6 grams. Schisandra is frequently consumed in the form of an infusion. To make an infusion, pour cup berries into a one gallon container of dark fresh fruit juice and allow them to soak for one day, strain and drink. Schisandra can be added to tea decoctions and other herbal simmered brews. Shopping for astragalus and schisandra Two products containing both astragalus and schisandra stand out and are readily available online. Zand Astragalus Formula is available as a tincture in a 2 oz. bottle from Vitacost for $6.59, or as capsules in a bottle of 100 for $9.03. Gaia Herbs, a company that promises that all their ingredients are organic or wild crafted, sells Astragalus Supreme in a bottle of 60 capsules for $18.74. Both are excellent products.

0," Despite the name, pine nuts are actually not nuts at all but the seeds of the pine cone. They have been a popular source of nutrition since Paleolithic times and are used to add delicious flavor and texture to pesto sauce. Six amazing health benefits associated with pine nuts: Weight Loss Pine nuts are a rich source of pinolenic acid, which is a fatty acid that scientific research has proven to be an appetite suppressant. It works by causing your body to release the hormones cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1, which are hormones known to keep hunger at bay. Cardiovascular Support Pine nuts are an excellent source of monosaturated fat, which is known to decrease the levels of cholesterol in our blood stream, which in turn lowers our risk of heart attack and stroke. They also contain high amounts of vitamin E, vitamin K, copper, iron and manganese, which are all known to contribute to cardiovascular health. High in Iron Pine nuts are rich in iron, which the body uses for a great many of its essential processes such as the regulation of the central nervous system and blood circulation. The copper that is naturally present in pine nuts also aids in the absorption of iron by our bodies. Anti-Aging Another of the many benefits of pine nuts is its ability to slow down the aging process. This is done by their high antioxidant content which protects the body against the damage done by free radicals. Free radicals are molecules that are produced either when our body breaks down food or we are exposed to harmful environmental hazards such as tobacco smoke or radiation. They can damage cells and may play a role in heart disease and cancer as well as accelerating the aging process. Copper is also present in pine nuts and is also known to help prevent aging. Eye Health Pine nuts also contain lutein which helps our eyes filter UV light, preventing it from damaging the macula, which is the region of the retina responsible for central vision. Macular degeneration increases with age, and lutein will help prevent your sight from deteriorating. Also present in pine nuts is beta-carotene, which the human body converts into vitamin A, which is very good for the overall health of our eyes. Energy Boost Pine nuts are also a great means of boosting our energy levels. They contain protein that our body requires to repair and build tissues. Unlike the quick-fix energy drinks so popular today, protein is a slow-burning fuel that gives us long lasting energy that does not result in burnout. The magnesium present in pine nuts also helps improve our bodies' use of oxygen to burn calories and increase our energy levels. "
0," Comfrey, used for centuries to help stop bleeding and heal wounds as far back as the times of Roman chariot races, is still considered a beneficial herb that can be used topically as well as internally.(1) In fact, its botanical name is symphytum officinale which means 'to heal.'(2) However, it has a host of benefits that extend beyond helping with wound-healing and bleeding. Top healing benefits of comfrey The herb, also known as knitbone, has been enjoyed by many cultures through the years for its ability to help heal a variety of conditions. Here's a closer look at some of the top benefits of comfrey. 1) Heals wounds, may prevent life-threatening conditions Perhaps the most common use of comfrey involves use in expediting healing of wounds, many of which are extremely serious. Documented cases note that comfrey, when applied to the body by grinding the herb and mixing with warm water to form a paste (making a poultice), has prevented the need for amputation in those with serious limb injuries and even healed malignant tumors.(1) It acts as a disinfectant, so it's ideal for placement on scrapes, and when eaten, can assist with internal bleeding.(3) 2) Diminishes pain Because comfrey is a mild sedative, it can provide pain relief naturally and is often used by people who have experienced broken bones or sprains because it reduces swelling and bruises as well.(2) 3) Banishes damaging free radicals The healing herb is brimming with a high quantity of antioxidants, which contributes to the prevention of toxic free radicals.(2) When the body is not filled with harmful toxins that damage the body's cells, health is optimized and overall health can be properly maintained. 4) Anti-inflammatory Comfrey contains Mucilage and Allantoin, compounds known to alleviate problems caused by inflammation .(3) Chronic inflammation, as many sufferers are aware, can negatively impact the immune system and has been linked to everything from depression and diabetes to cancer and heart disease.(4) "
0," Tweet A reader asks, 'After having gall bladder surgery three weeks ago, I am having a lot of discomfort, bloating, nausea, and in general, not feeling well. My doctor says it will pass, but it seems to be getting worse. I am a 65-year-old woman. Do you have any advice?' The first piece of advice I have for people who are considering gall bladder surgery is to get advice before the surgery, not after it, because once you've had the gall bladder removed, your options are quite limited. Remember that conventional medicine loves to go in and remove organs that are presenting symptoms rather than addressing the root cause of the problem in the first place. They think that by removing the organ that hurts, they've cured the problem. Hogwash! Gall bladder disease and gallstones are almost always the result of poor nutrition. For example: consuming a lot of soft drinks, sugar products, highly acidic foods like red meat and products made with white flour all contribute to the formation of gallstones. Gallstones can be reversed, but its something that takes quite a bit of time. After all, they have been formed in your body over a period of decades, so it's not something you can get rid of overnight from a nutritional standpoint. At the same time, I know that a lot of people are experiencing extreme pain when it comes to passing gall bladder stones. So obviously, those people are looking at surgical procedures as a more immediate technique for getting rid of the pain. Let's look at some information about gallstones because it is something that affects somewhere around 18 million people in the United States, and maybe even as many as 1 in every 12 people. And yet most people don't know they have them. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pain from gallstones results in about 800,000 hospitalizations and more than 500,000 operations each year in the United States. Unfortunately, the NIH doesn't give people a lot of information about how to actually avoid gall bladder problems. It's also critical to recognize that the gall bladder has an important function in digestion. And, if you just remove it (which by the way is quite the barbaric thing to do), you are compromising your digestive health for the rest of your life. Surgeons who remove gall bladders are complacent in educating patients about nutritional changes they need to pursue after losing this important digestive organ. For example, you're not going to get the same quality of digestion you would have had if your gall bladder were in place. You're not going to get the excretion of the bile from the gall bladder into the small intestine, and as a result, you're not going to efficiently digest foods that are moving through your digestive tract. This is especially true for dietary fats, including essential fatty acids. Without a gall bladder, you're not going to be able to digest dietary fats with any degree of efficiency. This means that if you don't take bile salts as a nutritional supplement every time you eat healthy fats, you'll miss out on all-important omega-3 fatty acids and other healthy oils. That's why people who have had gall bladder removal surgery usually suffer the classic signs of EFA deficiencies: poor nervous system function, irritability, learning difficulties, heart disease, poor blood sugar control, and so on. Doctors and surgeons flat out aren't telling patients this all-important information. It's downright criminal, if you ask me. This basic education should be required by law. It's flat-out evil to remove an essential organ from a patient's body and neglect to tell them about the long-term adjustments they need to make in order to compensate for that missing organ. And you know why surgeons don't tell people the truth about gall bladder removal surgery? I suspect it's because if people knew the horrifying nutritional consequences of the procedure, they'd refuse to do it, and surgeons and hospitals would lose out on those paying customers. Talking to a gall bladder surgeon about your gall bladder health is sort of like taking your car to a greasy garage mechanic and asking, 'Is there anything wrong with the transmission?' The answer you get is designed to pad his pockets. If you want honest answers on gall bladder pain, go visit a naturopath. As always, I strongly recommend that people who are considering this surgery look at naturopathic options, because removing a functional organ from your digestive tract is never a health-enhancing solution. It's just something that's too easy for conventional medicine to do. They do hundreds of thousands of these surgeries a year. They dont consider it a big deal so the patients dont think its a big deal either! But it really is a big deal. It's sort of like saying, 'Well, doctor, my tongue hurts.' And the doctor says, 'Let's cut out your tongue.' In fact, your gall bladder is far more important for digestion than your tongue. Do everything you can to protect your gall bladder. Along those lines, one of the most important things you need to do is physically massage your internal organs through body movement. A lot of people are surprised to hear this, but your internal organs need to be massaged just like your muscles and skin. Massage therapy is something that I recommend everyone pursue to enhance his or her health. Massage moves lymph fluid around the body. It stimulates the skin. It even stimulates the brain indirectly and helps create an immunostimulating relaxation response in virtually everyone. The internal organs need this same massage and the very best way to massage these internal organs, such as the gall bladder, is to engage in gentle body movement exercises. One of the very best you can pursue is Tai Chi. By following the gentle, pivoting movements of Tai Chi, you will massage your liver, gall bladder, pancreas, and even your heart. These organs are not fixed in place. They're not fixed in your body like they are on an anatomy chart. Your organs move around, and they actually benefit from movement just like massaging a limb. Also along those lines, one of the most important things you need to do is engage in breathing therapy because conscious breathing and deep breathing offers an outstanding massage to all the internal organs in your torso. Your lungs take up a tremendous amount of space in your chest cavity, and when you inhale and really expand your lungs, you are moving the other organs in your cavity and giving them a massage at the same time. Breathing is an excellent way to oxygenate your internal organs and get some movement. And by the way, your average conventional medicine physician isnt going to recommend any of this -- nor will he or she even believe any of it. They've never been taught that massage is important for internal organs. In fact, most doctors I know don't think massage is useful at all, which sort of just goes to show you how little they know about how the human body really works! But massage is critical. And of course, so is nutrition. Once again, your best strategy here for your gall bladder is to avoid removing it. Instead, support gall bladder health through diet, nutrition, and physical exercise. For the reader question in particular, if you've had the gall bladder removed, and you're having a lot of discomfort. What should you do now? I'm sorry to say that these are the predictable side effects of having a gall bladder removed. And chances are your doctor or surgeon probably didn't explain this fully to you. Surgeons have a habit of making everything sound really simple, up until the day you have the procedure done. Then, you start experiencing all sorts of rather serious side effects, and they say, 'Oh yeah! That could happen as well.' Hopefully, in this experience, you've learned a lesson. And that lesson is, dont have body parts removed by overzealous surgeons. I dont know how to state it any simpler than that. I'm sorry I dont have a simple solution for you to regain your health after having your gall bladder removed. But the fact is, when you start removing important organs from your body, it is going to have some serious negative consequences -- by the way, bloating and nausea is really only the tip of the iceberg here. The worst effects are the ones you probably won't feel, that is, impaired digestion for the rest of your life and chronic essential fatty acid deficiencies. In fact, people without gall bladders need to take special care of the foods they consume for the rest of their lives. And above all, they need to avoid all fried foods and any snack foods containing hydrogenated oils or trans fatty acids due to the role of the gall bladder plays in neutralizing excess dietary cholesterol.

0," This article will look at how the breath connects our inner expectations and our outer experience, our mind-body-spirit, our conscious and subconscious mind, how it is literally the bridge connecting all of these aspects of our being and our existence and how it can become blocked and the effects that it can have. It is known that the breath is intimately linked with our emotional state of being. The previous article showed how it can relate to our physiological well-being. What is perhaps less well known, or less thought about is the links without spiritual and subconscious aspects. In virtually all schools of yoga and meditation; however, the importance of the breath will be mentioned at some point and most schools have some kind of breathing exercises to help one reach higher states of spiritual awareness, just as psychologists have breathing exercises to emotionally calm clients. Through healing modalities like breathwork it is now known that the breath has the power to access our subconscious and all of the traumas and behavioral patterns stored within. It also has the power to transform and release these issues. In a study by Smith, it was concluded that, 'The use of breathwork for clients offers a safe and reliable approach to exploring transpersonal states as well as a quick method for accessing unconscious material... Individuals have reported rapid improvement in a wide range of disorders as a result of breathwork treatment' So how is it that these issues are stored and how can the breath alone be so effective in resolving them? Breathing inhibition - The hidden key There are few people in the world who know how to effectively deal with emotional issues. Nearly all of us use one tool or another to suppress such feelings, be it ice cream or chocolate, sex, drugs or alcohol. This avoidance is known to cause anxiety and depression as well as increased sympathetic arousal, which then holds the body in a constant, chronic state of stress. Coupled with these issues is breathing inhibition. By breathing less fully into life, we are able to avoid, to a greater or lesser extent, the uncomfortable feelings and emotions. It is also a way of continually suppressing these sensations and thus, via classical conditioning, these inhibitions become habitual. The problem here is two-fold. By decreasing our oxygen intake we reduce the supply of oxygen to the brain and body which reduces its ability to function and has been shown to lead to a variety of psychophysiological issues. It also means that, rather than processing the issues we have in our day-to-day life, they are suppressed and stored in our subconscious. These stored issues, as well as taking a large amount of energy to suppress, then condition how we experience our reality. If the issue involved physical danger then by storing this, we can believe that the world is a dangerous place and we will thus attract or interpret events via this belief and repeatedly prove it to be so. Many of our beliefs and behavioral patterns come from our formative years. During this time, we are like a sponge, soaking up information and making conclusions about life. However, these conclusions are not always correct, particularly if based upon extreme, traumatic events. We have suppressed these issues so well and become so accustomed to our way of experiencing life, and indeed of breathing, that we are generally unaware of this cause and effect relationship, usually we only see the results. It is therefore imperative, if we wish to evolve physically, mentally and spiritually, that we release our breathing inhibitions and all of the emotional baggage that we have inside so we can experience life and its wonders with eyes unconditioned by fear.

0," Large daily doses of B vitamins may protect vulnerable populations from the brain shrinkage and memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease, according to a study conducted by researchers from Oxford University and published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May. The new findings came from a reanalysis of data originally collected in 2010 from 271 older adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment, a form of memory loss considered a potential precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Although the brain naturally shrinks as we get older (about 0.5 percent per year), in people with mild cognitive impairment this shrinkage takes place twice as fast as usual. In Alzheimer's patients, shrinkage takes place four times as fast as usual. The researchers assigned participants to take either a placebo pill or a high daily dose of three B vitamins - folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B6 (20 mg) and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) - over the course of two years. They found that memory loss halted in those who took the B vitamins, but not in those who took the placebo. The vitamins also slowed brain shrinkage by 50 percent compared to the placebo, but only in patients with higher-than-normal blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. The homocysteine connection In healthy humans, homocysteine levels are low because the amino acid is quickly transformed into other substances, including the memory-regulating chemical acetylcholine. Researchers have long known that in Alzheimer's patients, homocysteine levels tend to be high and acetylcholine levels tend to be low. Because B vitamins appear to play a role in converting homocysteine into acetylcholine, researchers had wondered if the vitamins might help stem the development of Alzheimer's. Researchers remain unsure whether it is high levels of homocysteine, low levels of acetylcholine, or some other factor that leads to the development of Alzheimer's. Whatever the case, however, the 2010 study was the first to directly showed that increasing B vitamin levels might have a clinical effect. 'B vitamins lower homocysteine, which directly leads to a decrease in GM atrophy, thereby slowing cognitive decline,' the researchers wrote. New analysis strengthens findings One of the weaknesses of the original analysis, however, was that researchers could not prove that the observed improvements in memory were related to the decreased rate of brain shrinkage. In the new study, researchers conducted a more advanced analysis of the original data and found that the effect of the B vitamins was actually much greater than they had in initially thought: Among those taking the vitamins, brain shrinkage was reduced by an astonishing 90 percent, not just 50 percent. 'I've never seen results from brain scans showing this level of protection,' said brain imaging expert Paul Thompson, who heads the world's largest brain scan database at the UCLA School of Medicine 's Imaging Genetics Center. 'We study the brain effects of all sorts of lifestyle changes - alcohol reduction, exercising more, learning to handle stress, weight loss - and a good result would be a 25 percent reduction in shrinkage.' Notably, the new analysis also found that the B vitamins had the greatest protective benefit in the very areas of the brain that are most affected by Alzheimer's, including regions responsible for learning, memory and the organization of thoughts. The analysis also showed that the reduction in this damage was indeed directly responsible for halting participants' memory loss. 'The study needs to be repeated because there's a lot to learn about why homocysteine is damaging and whether lowering it can stop people with memory problems progressing to Alzheimer's,' said Thompson, who was not involved in the study. 'But if the results survive retesting, homocysteine level could be a useful biomarker for Alzheimer's risk.' "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Diets that have plenty of olive oil may be helping prevent body cell damage that can lead to cancer, suggests a study by researchers in Denmark. Researchers from Copenhagen University Hospital looked at 182 men between the ages of 20 and 60, hailing from five European countries, for two weeks. During that time, the men consumed one-quarter cup of olive oil a day, and showed an average 13 percent reduction in 8oxodG, a marker of oxidative damage to DNA cells. This damage is usually caused when reactive oxygen species -- metabolism byproducts -- overcome the body's antioxidant defenses. While olive oil is known to contain phenols, which are believed to be powerful antioxidants, they do not account for the drop in oxidative damage to DNA, said study co-author Dr. Henrick E. Poulsen and colleagues. The men consumed olive oils with varying levels of phenols, but the oxidative damage was reduced regardless of these levels. The study results -- reported in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's The FASEB Journal -- seem to suggest that the monosaturated fats found in olive oil are more likely causing the beneficial effect, the scientists said. The study participants from Northern Europe showed higher 8oxodG levels than their Southern European counterparts, which could account for the fact that, in the past, men from Northern Europe have been found to have higher rates of cancer than men in Southern Europe, where the olive-oil-rich 'Mediterranean diet' is a staple. In fact, the scientists reported, Northern Europeans generally have higher levels certain cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian and prostate cancers. Poulsen said the evidence supports advice that suggests replacing saturated fats from meats and butter with vegetable fats such as olive oil. However, he was quick to point out that olive oil was just one part of the Mediterranean diet, which is also rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish. He added that olive oil's benefits notwithstanding, it was not a replacement for calorie control and regular exercise. ### "
0," The numbers, quite frankly, are grim: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in America and the fourth leading cause of cancer death globally. And even if the colon cancer is not fatal, it can lead to radiation or chemotherapy as well as surgical removal of the colon and the placement of a colostomy bag, which can seriously impact the quality of life for these cancer survivors. That is why so much research in recent years has gone into discovering ways that this cancer can be prevented in the first place. It has long been suspected that a typical American diet - with its reliance on meat and starches - can raise the risk of colon cancer development. And this new study illustrates clearly how important the link between diet and this disease really is. Intriguing new research This elegantly done study was a collaborative effort between researchers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and those in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The researchers chose 20 African-American men and women in Pittsburgh and 20 men and women of African descent living in KwaZulu-Natal to participate in this study that looked at the link between diet and colon cancer risk. Before this study began, researchers performed an analysis of the gut microbes in each participant. In other words, they looked at the kind of bacteria living in the digestive tract of every patient in the study. Every patient also underwent a colonoscopy, or visual study of the colon, during which it was discovered that nine out of the 20 Americans had colon polyps (which can become cancerous) while 0 out of the 20 South Africans had the same problem. Then the study itself began. How the research was done In this two-week study, the group of 20 African Americans ate a traditionally South African diet. Such a diet consists largely of plant-based foods including a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains and beans. Meanwhile, the 20 South Africans ate a diet that mimicked that of the West, with approximately 2-3 times more meat and fat than their native diet usually included. After two weeks, participants were examined again. It was found that major changes had taken place in just the short time that this study took to complete its course. The African Americans on the South African diet showed better health in their intestinal flora as well as reduced inflammation and other signs of damage to the colon. Meanwhile, the South Africans on a typically American diet showed increased inflammation of the colon and a decrease in the health of their guts. Both of these are considered to be risk factors for colon cancer . In short, this study is part of a large (and growing) body of evidence to show that a diet which is rich in plant-based foods helps to reduce the risk of colon cancer, while a diet that is high in fats and meat-based protein increases the chances that this cancer will develop. It is yet another good reason for people to consider cutting back on red meat and high fat foods and increasing their dietary intake of fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods.

0," Spending time outdoors soaking up the sun is beneficial not only for a healthy-looking tan, but for your heart's health as well. Studies have shown that vitamin D , which is primarily obtained through exposure to the sun's rays, can help in preventing coronary artery disease, heart attacks and strokes. A recent study appears to have pinpointed the exact levels of vitamin D in the blood necessary for preventing coronary problems. Dr. J. Brent Muhlestein, of the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, led the research which was presented recently at the American Heart Association's 2015 Scientific Sessions. From Medical News Today : Individuals who do not get enough vitamin D through dietary sources or sun exposure often have vitamin D deficiency when the levels of the vitamin in the body are too low, which is determined by measuring levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) in the blood. Muhlestein and his team determined that 25-OHD levels below 15 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) were associated with a 35 percent increased risk of experiencing a 'cardiovascular event.' The study involved four groups of people who were categorized based on their 25-OHD levels: those with less than 15 ng/mL, and those with levels between 1529 ng/mL, 3044 ng/mL or more than 45 ng/mL. The research indicated that all three groups with 15 ng/mL levels of 25-OHD or above shared essentially the same lowered risk levels. In other words, vitamin D supplements are unlikely to benefit those with levels above the 15 ng/mL benchmark. Dr. Muhlestein said: This study sheds new light and direction on which patients might best benefit from taking vitamin D supplements. Even though there's a possibility that patients may benefit in some way from achieving higher blood levels of vitamin D, this new information tells us the greatest benefit to the heart will likely occur among patients whose vitamin D level is below 15 ng/mL. Since one out of 10 people have 25-OHD levels below 15 ng/mL, Dr. Muhlestein recommends taking the simple blood test necessary to determine what an individual's levels are so that supplements can be prescribed, if necessary. More about vitamin D Vitamin D plays several roles in promoting health . It is necessary for the growth and maintenance of healthy bones and teeth and is useful in preventing heart disease, but it is believed to provide other benefits as well. Among the other benefits of vitamin D are its ability to reduce the risk of influenza and type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiencies have been associated with elevated risk and severity of certain childhood diseases and allergies, including asthma, eczema and atopic dermatitis. Vitamin D may also play a role in helping the body fight and prevent cancer , and is also believed to play a role in healthy pregnancies. Deficiencies in vitamin D are suspected of causing many other health problems: Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, autism, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma severity and swine flu, however more reliable studies are needed before these associations can be proven. Although sunlight is the main source of vitamin D, it can also be found in oily fish, egg yolks and cheese. There are also supplements available, but it is recommended that people should rely on natural sources as much as possible to increase their levels: It has been proven time and again that isolating certain nutrients in supplement form will not provide the same health benefits as consuming the nutrient from a whole food. First focus on obtaining your daily vitamin D requirement from sunlight and foods then use supplements as a backup. Sources: MedicalNewsToday.com DailyMail.co.uk MedicalNewsToday.com "
0," Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) encompasses Chinese herbal remedies, acupuncture, and other lesser-known modalities to treat a wide variety of diseases including gout. Chinese medicine is thousands of years old, and well-respected worldwide as an alternative to conventional Western medicine. According to acupuncturist and TCM practitioner Simon Becker, a clinical study conducted by Zhang Ming and Tiao Rong [in China] comparing the efficacy of Western gout treatments with Chinese herbs for gout indicated the outcomes of '...both treatment groups receiving Chinese medicinals and the control group receiving standard Western medicines was essentially equal (94.2 percent vs. 94 percent) The only notable difference between the two groups was that the control group which received the Western medicine suffered from many side effects, whereas the treatment group did not'. According to Becker, Chinese herbs are free of dangerous side effects when used under proper supervision by a knowledgeable natural health care practitioner. Ermiao wan A study published in the 2004 Journal of Ethnopharmacology reports how the Chinese herb Ermiao wan reduces swelling and edema; and, is being used in China to treat gout patients and those with hyperuricemia, or elevated uric acid levels. This herb is available from Chinese herbalists and practitioners and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified Doctor of Oriental Medicine. Meadow saffron Meadow saffron produces the alkaloids colchicine and colchicoside, both possessing analgesic and diuretic properties that relieve gout pain, inflammation and edema, or water retention around affected joints. Colchicine is also found conventional pharmaceutical drugs for gout treatment. Patients taking colchicine in any form must be carefully supervised by a knowledgeable health practitioner due to its level of toxicity. Dandelion Another herb used to relieve gout pain in both TCM and in Western herbal medicine is dandelion. Herbalists use dandelion for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Make into a tea or an herbal poultice for a topical application in gout. Dandelion also reduces swelling and edema around joints. It stimulates the excretion of uric acid, the cause of gouty arthritis. Burdock root Burdock root reduces inflammation and swelling in the tissues. It is indicated when there are swollen tissues around joints and as a natural diuretic that helps to reduce edema. Brew the root into a tea or use as a poultice for topical applications. The root is edible and can be cooked like carrots or parsnips, or eaten raw on salads. There have been reports of adverse reactions when used topically, reports Urban Herbs. It some cases it may cause a rash or contact dermatitis. Blood-letting cupping Although, not popular in the West, and one that went out of fashion over one hundred years ago, the use of blood-letting or cupping is once again in use in China to treat gout, reports the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2010. A study of 34 participants suffering from acute gout was completed using blood-letting cupping combined with Chinese herbs . The results indicated that 21 of the 34 cases improved under this treatment method, which is considered a satisfactory treatment for gouty arthritis. Consult a trained practitioner and do not self-treat with blood-letting cupping for gout. "
0," The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research center focused on civil liberties, recently held a conference to discuss U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) airport security protocols. Jim Babb, founder of WeWontFly.com, spoke at the event, where he suggested that the TSA be disbanded and passengers be given the freedom to choose the level of security they feel comfortable with. Babb emphasized at the conference that full-body backscatter radiation scanners and invasive, genitalia-groping pat downs have done nothing to improve security and everything to help condition the populace to accept degrading and humiliating treatment by what is now being called the 'badge class', or those that hold authoritarian, police-state positions over the America populace. According to Babb, if 'security' is decentralized and given back to the people where it belongs constitutionally, Americans would be both free and safe. 'We need flexible, decentralized, innovative security that only a competitive marketplace can provide,' Babb explained to listeners. 'As passengers, we need the freedom to select the level of security that we are comfortable with. Those who want a full prostate exam can have it. Those that prefer more modest techniques can have that, too. Let 'grope-and-scope' airline compete with 'free-and-dignified' airline. It's better for security, better for privacy, and avoids the constitutional issues.' A father himself, Babb cited numerous cases of sexual assault and degrading forms of fondling that continue to take place against innocent travelers, including young children, in the name of security . He also explained that the companies that make airport scanning machines -- including Rapiscan, which hired former U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Michael Chertoff to promote scanner use ( http://www.selfnews.com/030505_naked_body... ) -- are behind the push to increase airport security protocols, for reasons obviously other than to actually improve safety.

0," As word continues to spread about the damaging health effects of refined sugar, the number of commercially available sugar alternatives has also increased. Unfortunately, many sugar alternatives can be just as undesirable as sugar itself. Saccharin and acesulfame K, for example, are unnatural products whose long-term effects on the human body remain unknown. High fructose agave syrup is proven to cause havoc with our blood sugar levels. And aspartame, of course, needs no introduction. One sugar alternative that is proven to be healthy, however, is erythritol. Though it might sound like something synthesized in a Big Pharma lab for diabolical purposes, erythritol is actually a natural sugar alcohol found in many whole foods -- and its taste closely resembles that of sugar. Erythritol does not spike blood sugar levels Since humans lack the enzymes required to break it down, erythritol does not affect our triglycerides, cholesterol, or other metabolic biomarkers. Consequently, its effect on our blood sugar levels -- one of the biggest concerns people have regarding sweeteners -- is non-existent. This has been confirmed by a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , which found that erythritol '...did not affect serum levels of glucose, insulin or other serum constituents.' Erythritol's benign effects on our blood sugar is great news for people seeking to lose weight, since blood sugar spikes prompt the pancreas to produce more insulin, the hormone responsible for fat storage. Additionally, even though erythritol contains 70 percent of the sweetness of sugar, it only contains 6 percent of its calories. Erythritol benefits our teeth Although there are countless reasons to give up refined sugar, its negative effect on our teeth is one of the biggest. Yes, sugar really does feed the destructive bacteria in our mouths that is responsible for enamel erosion, and substituting it with a sugar-free sweetener can be an important first step towards improved oral health. However, erythritol doesn't simply leave our teeth unaffected -- it can actively improve them. For example, a study published in the journal Caries Research found that erythritol (along with xylitol, another sugar alcohol) 'significantly reduced' the amount of dental plaque in teenage subjects when compared to the control group. The researchers also noted than erythritol and xylitol (but especially the former) inhibited the growth of certain strains of Mutans streptococci , which is one of the biggest initiators of dental caries. Erythritol is safe in high doses One of the biggest benefits of erythritol compared to most other sugar alternatives is that it's simply safe to consume for almost everyone, even in high doses. A review featured in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology , for instance, concluded that erythritol is well-tolerated by humans and animals. Another review published in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology found that large doses of erythritol (1 gram per kilogram of body weight daily) were also tolerated well by the subjects. Most of the erythritol was excreted harmlessly through the urinary tract, and no digestion problems occurred.

0," Conventional cancer treatment protocols are largely ineffective, which is why many doctors end up prescribing experimental drugs to their most severely diseased patients to see if they provide any benefits. But a new study out of Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, has found that most of the time, experimental treatments do nothing to help patients. And worse, they typically cause other serious and life-threatening side effects. Published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , the new report is based on data from 172 trials published over the course of two years. After a thorough data analysis, researchers discovered that less than one third of experimental drugs show any visible signs of improving patient health, and less than 50 percent have any positive effects on any other condition. Meanwhile, two thirds or more of experimental drugs cause severe or life-threatening side effects. 'People need to realize that because the trials have not been completed there is a great deal that is not known about the treatments,' explained Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS) to Reuters Health. 'There are people who get these treatments and get hurt.' And if those statistics are not bad enough, researchers say actual statistics are likely far worse. Most of the time, negative study results are withheld from journal publications, which skews the real life results. So in the end, the effectiveness of experimental drugs is poor at best, and purely detrimental at worst. selfnews recently covered several stories about the illegitimacy of many drug trials. Back in August, it was revealed that drug company-funded clinical trials -- which are often the ones that end up in prestigious journals -- almost always yield good results ( http://www.selfnews.com/029394_clinical_t... ). Drug companies routinely tamper with trial results to make a drug look more effective than it actually is ( http://www.selfnews.com/030107_drug_compa... ), deceiving both the medical community and the public.

0," Bringing new meaning to the term blue balls , a study has shown that eating a diet containing genetically modified soy actually caused the testicles of rats to turn blue. The study is just one of many cited in a report by the Institute for Responsible Technology reviewing research on the potential harmful effects of a diet containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The report warns that the overall public health damage from GMOs will likely exceed that from other notorious poisons once touted as safe, such as asbestos or tobacco. That's because unlike those substances, GMOs have directly and profoundly contaminated the human food supply. 'Everyone eats: everyone is affected,' the report reads. GMOs also turn your organs black According to the report, nearly every independent animal feeding study conducted with GMOs has demonstrated harms from a diet containing transgenic feed. The 'blue balls' are mentioned in a section of the report focused on reproductive failure and infant mortality. The change in color was only one of numerous changes observed in the testicles of rats fed soybeans engineered to resist Monsanto's Roundup herbicide (this trait is found in 80 percent of commercialized GMOs planted). Mice also underwent testicular changes (though not a change in color), including alterations to the function of young sperm cells. Other studies have found changes in the DNA function of embryos, lower litter size, lower birth weight and dramatically higher infant mortality in rodents fed GMOs. Farmers have also reported dramatic fertility problems among livestock fed GMO feed. Sterility has been reported in cows, bulls and pigs. Pigs have also had false pregnancies or birthed empty bags of water GMO feed has also been implicated in the deaths of a wide variety of livestock, including sheep, cows, horses, chickens and water buffaloes. In one notorious case, sheep in India allowed to graze on GM cotton suffered a one in four mortality rate. In one region in India, GM cotton was linked to 10,000 sheep deaths. Postmortem examination found black patches in the internal organs of the sheep, and investigators said preliminary evidence 'strongly suggests that the sheep mortality was due to a toxin.... most probably Bt-toxin.' The cotton in question was engineered to produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin. Bt varieties represent about 20 percent of commercial GMOs. Industry and government collude to keep you eating poison Other studies reviewed in the report have connected GMOs with damage to internal organs (especially the liver), toxic digestive effects, allergies and immune dysfunction, and higher death rates. In spite of this overwhelming body of evidence, the FDA continues to grant GMOs a presumption of safety. In a shocking and potentially illegal 1992 decision that is still in force, the FDA ruled that GMOs could be considered safe with no further testing simply if the company producing them said they were! The FDA's collusion with GMO producers is just one part of a wider campaign to conceal the toxic health effects of GMOs, the report alleges. Other tactics used by GMO advocates include attempts to discredit critics of GMOs, including independent scientists who turn up evidence of harm; performing deliberately flawed research studies to 'prove' the safety of GMOs; and manipulating public opinion by disseminating dishonest information and intimidating mainstream media outlets out of running GMO-critical stories. Yet in spite of these efforts, US consumers are increasingly skeptical of GMOs, with about 90 percent supporting mandatory labeling of GMO ingredients. On March 16, the Senate rejected a bill that would have prohibited such mandatory labeling measures, replacing them with a voluntary program administered by the industry-friendly US Department of Agriculture (USDA) .

0," As more and more countries within the European Union struggle economically, the euro - the union's common currency - becomes more embattled, with its founder now even predicting its demise. German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who was responsible the euro's development and launch, is now calling for the end of the single currency in order to let southern Europe recover. He says if not, the current fiscal course is 'leading to disaster.' 'The economic situation is worsening from month to month, and unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever more in doubt,' he said, according to the Telegraph , one of Britain's largest dailies. 'The Germans have not yet realized that southern Europe, including France, will be forced by their current misery to fight back against German hegemony sooner or later,' he said, adding that much of the current fiscal crisis has come in large part from Germany's squeeze on wages, in order to gain export share. 'Austerity is finished' On the parliamentary website of Germany's Left Party, Lafontaine said German Chancellor Angela Merkel will 'awake from her self-righteous slumber' once the European countries in economic dire straits come together to force changes in crisis policy, at the expense of Germany. Lafontaine's dire prediction appeared to gain credibility as French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici 'proclaimed the end of austerity and a triumph of French policy, risking further damage to the tattered relations between Paris and Berlin,' the paper reported. 'Austerity is finished. This is a decisive turn in the history of the EU project since the euro,' Moscovici told French TV. 'We're seeing the end of austerity dogma. It's a victory of the French point of view.' The French minister's comments came on the heels of a deal with Brussels giving France and Spain an additional two years to meet deficit targets of 3 percent of GDP. But his triumphant tone could mean that hardliners in Berlin will become angry, confirming fears that such concessions will only lead to more fiscal chaos in the months ahead. In early May German Vice-Chancellor Philipp Rosler attacked the European Commission, calling its decision to undermine the necessary belt-tightening 'irresponsible.' Whether the current breakdown of the German-Franco alliance that has driven politics on the continent for more than a half-century is the fault of Berlin or Paris may be irrelevant at this point, but clearly the situation is spiraling out of control. France's Socialist Party - which now controls the prime minister's office - lashed out at the 'selfish intransigence' of Merkel, accusing her of thinking over of 'German savers, her trade balance, and her electoral future.' For his part, Lafontaine said he backs EMU but just doesn't think it is sustainable. 'Hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic behavior on all sides were in vain,' he said, noting that the policy of forcing Spain, Portugal, and Greece to carry out internal devaluations was a 'catastrophe.' The economies of those three nations, plus Ireland and Holland, are among the EU's worst. The euro has been in decline for months now, and as nations of the EU continue to deal with high unemployment and high government spending due to overpromising of benefits and lower revenues, there doesn't seem to be a future for the currency , much less the EU as a viable entity, experts believe. In March, the Atlantic Monthly also reported that it is just a matter of time before the demise of the euro, simply because the EU doesn't have the fiscal infrastructure - or never had it - to make a common currency work: Here's the Cliff Notes version of the euro crisis. The euro zone doesn't have the fiscal or banking unions it needs to make monetary union work, and it's not close to changing that. In the meantime, the euro's continuing flaws continue to suck countries into crisis. And their politics get radicalized. Most recently, Cyprus was forced to accept a bailout and bail-in, because its too-big-to-save banks made some horrendously bad bets on Greek bonds. Fundamental flaws in the euro's design Here are some of the euro's basic flaws: Money is too tight. The euro zone is not what economists would label an optimal place for currency. 'In other words,' Atlantic Monthly says, 'it was a bad idea.' Part of the reason why is because the various EU members should have different monetary policies but they don't. Budgets are too tight. Experts believe austerity has been an utter failure, if not outright disaster, because it has actually increased debt burdens across southern Europe especially. 'The euro has become an austerity suicide pact.' Not enough trade. Save Germany, a little more than half of the EU's nations primarily trade with each other. As southern Europe slides into depression and northern Europe edges toward recession, each will purchase even less from the others. As with all socialist countries, the nations of Europe simply do not have enough resources to continue providing cradle-to-grave services for their people. That is angering to tens of millions who have been raised to believe that the European money pit is bottomless but who are now realizing the fallacy of such thinking. As an aside, it is important to note that both world wars last century began on a tumultuous European continent . "
0," The reason that cases of whooping cough have been on the rise in the United States is due not to fewer people vaccinating their children but to a decreased effectiveness of the vaccine itself, according to a study conducted by researchers from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology on April 23. Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is named after the distinctive gasping, 'whooping' noise that patients make while inhaling after the severe coughing fits caused by the disease. In recent years, health experts have raised concerns that pertussis cases are on the rise. Between 1965 and 2002, there were an average of about 10,000 cases per year in the United States. In recent years, that number has risen to about 29,000 per year, with a high of 48,000 in 2012. The mystery of rising pertussis rates In the new study, the researchers applied mathematical models to a massive data set containing information on U.S. pertussis cases between 1950 and 2009 to test the various hypotheses posed to explain rising disease rates. The explanations tested included lower vaccination rates, improved diagnosis (either through increased awareness or more accurate diagnostic tests), and a change in the vaccine formula that took place in 1991. Prior to 1991, the pertussis vaccine was made from the killed body of the bacterium Bordetella pertussis , which causes the disease. But this vaccine sometimes led to severe convulsions, caused by fever and brain inflammation. Concern over these side effects led to the development, in 1991, of an 'acellular' vaccine , which does not contain killed bacterial bodies and should therefore have a lower rate of side effects. The acellular vaccine was adopted in the United States in the 1990s. The acellular vaccine is known to be less effective, however, having only an 80 percent effectiveness rate, compared with 90 percent for the (discontinued) whole-cell vaccine. Vaccine -- not vaccine refusers -- to blame The researchers analyzed the duration of the acellular vaccine and found that on average it confers immunity for 50 years. In a small number of people, however, the protection wears off significantly faster. This small change, combined with the 10 percent decrease in effectiveness, was enough to explain the change in pertussis prevalence over the past two decades. The researchers found further evidence in the fact that the demographic most infected by pertussis has changed from adolescents to children between the ages of 7 and 10. 'The lower level of protection of this group of kids is well explained by the fact that they were among the first group to be entirely vaccinated by the acellular vaccine,' lead researcher Manoj Gambhir said. Mathematical modeling failed to support any of the other hypotheses offered as explanations for increased pertussis cases . This means, of course, that parents who choose not to give their children the DTaP vaccine are not to blame for rising pertussis rates. Instead, a change in the vaccine itself wholly explains the recent increase. Don't expect the study to lead to any changes in the direction of U.S. vaccine policy, however. Even though the analysis found that the acellular vaccine provides protection for 50 years, the researchers suggested that perhaps booster shots should be given every 10. The study might also be used as an excuse for still more vaccine research and development. According to Dr. Pritish Tosh of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group, who was not involved in the study, the findings suggest that researchers need to develop still a third variety of pertussis vaccine, to solve the problems with the first (whole-cell) and second (acellular) types.

0," Do American liberals and conservatives look at political, social and ethical issues as if they are from different cultures? Yes, according to a new landmark study that examined the differences. The cultural psychology study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that, essentially, political conservatives in the U.S. are somewhat like East Asians in the manner in which they categorize, think and perceive. Meanwhile, 'liberals in the U.S. could be categorized as extreme Americans in thought, categorization and perception,' said a press release describing the study's findings, which have been published recently in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin . In addition, researchers found evidence that styles of thought -- whether holistic or analytical -- can be altered through training, and enough so that temporary changes in political thought and the way a person votes could occur. 'We found in our study that liberals and conservatives think as if they were from completely different cultures -- almost as different as East and West,' said study leader Thomas Talhelm, a Ph.D. candidate in cultural psychology. Conservative thinking dominates the world 'Liberals and conservatives categorize and perceive things differently, just as East Asians and Westerners look differently at the world,' he continued. Talhelm said that, according to study findings, American conservatives, generally speaking, and East Asians in particular, are intuitive, or 'holistic,' thinkers, though Westerners, generally, and American liberals in particular, think in a more analytical manner. That said, the term culture war is thought to be an accurate, though dramatic, description of the clear cultural differences in thought processes between conservatives and liberals 'On psychological tests, Westerners tend to view scenes, explain behavior and categorize objects analytically,' Talhelm said, according to the press release. 'But the vast majority of people around the world -- about 85 percent -- more often think intuitively -- what psychologists call holistic thought, and we found that's how conservative Americans tend to think.' The Ph.D candidate said holistic thought uses intention and the perception of whole objects or situations most often, instead of dissecting them into their individual parts -- like having a general feeling about a given situation involving intuition or tact. Meanwhile, he added, the study results indicated that analytical thinkers tend to examine parts of a situation and how they may work in tandem, toward the whole. This process involves 'slicing up the world and analyzing objects individually, divorced from context,' Talhelm said. The press release further stated: Studies show that analytical thinkers predominate in Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies (termed 'WEIRD' societies in 2010 by a team of cultural psychologists at the University of British Columbia). But they make up only about 15 percent of the world's population. So, in other words, in a WEIRD society like that found in the United States, analytical-thinking liberals are considered 'extreme Americans,' said Talhelm, in the manner that they are disinclined to think like the vast majority of the rest of the world, and that includes holistically thinking conservatives in their own country. Liberal thinking must be learned But, the researcher noted, there is some value in both ways of thinking. Intuitive thinking, Talhelm said, is likely the 'default' style that most people are born with. Analytical thinking, he continued, must necessarily be learned through training -- as in Western-style school systems (Writer's note: The term indoctrination comes immediately to mind). In testing thought styles, psychologists give study participants a short series of tests to determine what manner of thinker they happen to be -- holistic or analytic. 'One such test asks participants to choose two of three items to categorize together, such as a mitten, a scarf, and a hand,' said the press release. 'Analytic thinkers usually match the scarf and mitten because they belong to the same abstract category -- items of winter clothing. Holistic thinkers usually match the mitten and hand because the hand wears a mitten.' Researchers found, however, that political thought could be manipulated. Holistic thinkers could be trained to think analytically, for instance, to match scarf with mitten; in doing so, they would begin to view the world more liberally (except on economic policy). Likewise, in reverse, for liberal thinkers. Sources: http://psp.sagepub.com http://www.designntrend.com https://news.virginia.edu "
0," Not only can dogs sense the earth's magnetic field, but they can actually use it to orient their bodies when they relieve themselves, according to a study conducted by researchers from the Czech University of Life Sciences and the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, and published in Frontiers in Zoology . Magnetoreception, or the ability to sense the earth's magnetic field, has been demonstrated in a wide variety of animals, including bees, birds and even some mammals. 'We discovered [by measuring Google Earth aerial pictures] that cattle align with the magnetic field lines a few years ago,' researcher Sabine Begall said. 'Since then, we studied hunting behavior in [the] red fox and found that they have a preference for N-E during their mousing jumps, and from there it was just a small step to study dogs. First, we looked also at other behaviors but the results were less promising than the 'pooping direction.'' The current study is the first to demonstrate magnetoreception in dogs. 'Precisely oriented... while pooping' The researchers observed 70 different dogs of 37 different breeds over the course of two years, measuring how the dogs oriented themselves during a total of 1,893 defecations and 5,582 urinations. In order to control for any influence that humans might have on the dogs' behavior, all humans in the dogs' presence were kept 'blind' to magnetic orientation. The researchers found that unleashed dogs naturally oriented themselves toward magnetic north or south while defecating or urinating and completely avoided facing east or west. This orientation pattern remained consistent regardless of dog breed, sex, time of day, time of year or prevailing weather conditions. Although the researchers ruled out the possibility that the dogs were merely orienting themselves relative to the sun, they found that the sun did play an unexpected role in the dogs' behavior: solar flares and geomagnetic storms produced temporary disruptions in the earth's magnetic field , causing the dogs to revert to facing in random directions while relieving themselves. 'The dogs are very precisely oriented on the north-south axis while pooping, but only if the magnetic field is stable,' researcher Petra Kovakova said. 'On January 6 the magnetic field was very stable, which means that the dogs were very well oriented during pooping,' Kovakova said. 'On January 2 the magnetic field was very restless and the dogs were pooping in a random fashion.' In fact, natural fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field initially made it difficult for the researchers to discern the underlying pattern in the dogs' behavior. 'We were quite frustrated, because we couldn't find a clear preference for a certain direction,' Begall said. 'Then, we sorted the data according to the prevailing [magnetic-field] conditions at the time of recording, and this analysis revealed a highly significant and predictable effect.' 'It could be that the dogs somehow calibrate their compass or read their 'mental map' during the walks,' she said. 'Imagine that you read a compass during a hike. If the compass needle is shaky, you might dismiss reading the compass at all. That could be the reason why the dogs have no preference when the [magnetic field] is unstable.' The researchers have no idea why dogs orient themselves toward the poles while relieving themselves. 'It is still enigmatic why the dogs do align at all, whether they do it 'consciously' (i.e., whether the magnetic field is [sensorially] perceived (the dogs 'see', 'hear' or 'smell' the compass direction or perceive it as a haptic stimulus) or whether its reception is controlled on the vegetative level (they 'feel better/more comfortable or worse/less comfortable' in a certain direction) [ sic : missing parenthesis],' they wrote. "
0," The number of illegal immigrants arriving via the Obamabus program to a New Mexico facility already housing and caring for thousands of others who came before them is expected to increase in the coming weeks, according to reports. And with this will come more disease, as many of the fresh detainees are reportedly stricken with exotic diseases and, worse, don't seem to care much for their own health and hygiene. The New American says the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detention facility, located in Artesia, New Mexico, is expecting a new shipment of illegal aliens now that a chickenpox quarantine has been lifted. Back in May and June, roughly 10,000 new children per month were being admitted to the facility, with that number dropping off to around 3,100 in August, according to The Washington Times . But more immigrants are on the way following an announcement that all but 68 of the earlier detainees have now been released into the general public. This is a problem, as many of the families still there have serious health problems, such as difficulty using the bathroom, and lack common sense in how to properly dispose of urine- and feces-soiled bath tissue. 'Family unit illnesses and unfamiliarity with bathroom facilities continued to result in unsanitary conditions,' wrote Inspector General John Roth in a recent memo to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. 'If detainees do not attend sick call or stand in line to receive daily medications, they remain sick and their illnesses tend to get worse.' How much longer will Americans tolerate this war being waged against them by domestic enemies in DC? According to The New American , roughly 63,000 unaccompanied children from Central America entered the U.S. illegally between October 2013 and July 2014, with the help of DHS of course. This is double the number that was brought in the year prior, and many more this time around are arriving ill with communicable diseases like scabies and chickenpox, as well as lice. Ideally, these children crossing the border illegally will eventually appear in court for hearings about gaining legal immigration status. But this year, the Obama Administration facilitated a massive increase in the number of illegal aliens pouring across the border, and actually used taxpayer-funded buses to escort them to detention facilities, where they have actively spread disease. This, combined with the sudden outbreaks of enteroviruses like EV-D68, suggests that the Obama Administration is waging a war against the American people, one that specifically targets their health . It is no coincidence that this sudden uptick in illegal immigration directly corresponds with multiple enterovirus disease outbreaks that are sickening and killing Americans. As you may recall from earlier in the year, the Obama Administration posted a notice to the federal job site FedBizOpps.gov looking for 'Escort Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children.' The notice sought new government employees who would be willing to accommodate the transport of illegal immigrants to 'Refugee Resettlement shelters located throughout the continental United States.' The fact that these folks are even being referred to as 'refugees' delineates that they gained illegal entry into the U.S. And since the Obama Administration actively engaged in transporting these refugees, it, too, has acted illegally, betraying the American people and committing a form of treason against them, a crime punishable by death. And the treason is only expected to intensify. 'The White House signaled that, as least for now, it sees the flow of children -- which it predicts will more than double in 2015 -- as an issue to be managed rather than a problem to be fought,' claimed The Washington Times back in June.

0," More than thirty million people in the U.S. suffer from migraine headaches. That means that there is a migraine sufferer in twenty five percent of households, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders . Traditionally, sufferers use prescription drugs - 2.5 times more than the amount non-sufferers use - to help them get through it. However, even with the prescriptions, most experience an inability to function normally while having a migraine. The American Academy of Neurology says migraines range in severity and often come with a variety of symptoms from pulsating and throbbing pain, to light and sound sensitivity, to nausea and vomiting. There are a variety of triggers, including: - Fluorescent lights - Coffee - Dehydration - Smoking or alcohol abuse - High blood pressure or hypoglycemia - Vitamin B or D deficiency or mineral imbalances - Reaction to food additives such as MSG, sugar, colorings, or preservatives - Oral contraceptives or prescription medication - Food allergies or intolerances Rather than treating migraine pain with drugs that have potentially serious side effects, consider that these headaches are likely a symptom that the body is out of balance. Natural treatments There are lots of ways to treat a migraine headache with natural remedies that have a better success rate and far fewer health risks than prescriptions, including herbs, supplements, acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology, and aromatherapy. Herbs - Feverfew is effective at preventing migraines , but not stopping them once they've begun. The plant's active ingredient, parthenolide, inhibits the chemicals in the brain that cause the blood vessels to dilate. Another preventative with a lot of recent success in blind trials is butterbur extract . Used medicinally since the middle ages, butterbur extract can be taken daily as a preventative to reduce the number and severity of attacks. It is available commercially in capsules, powder, tincture, or other forms and is thought to have both antispasmodic effects and anti-inflammatory properties. It should be taken for 2 to 3 months until the migraine sufferer experiences a period 'free of migraines.' Self help techniques - There are several things a migraine sufferer can do after the onset of a migraine to help ease the pain. Hydrotherapy is easy, and it works. Contrast showers help with many ailments. Stand in water as hot as you can stand for two minutes (this increases blood flow to the skin), then as cold as you can stand for two minutes (this sends blood to the core of the body). Alternate back and forth for 20 minutes to increase blood flow and circulation, bringing nutrients to organs and carrying away toxins. Another way to use water to help with a headache is to put your feet in very cold water and a hot rag on the back of your neck. This helps bring the blood down out of your head, by sending it to your feet. Working acupressure points such as pinching the soft tissue between your thumb and forefinger can help alleviate pain as well. Another technique is to put your thumb in your mouth on the same side as the migraine pain, reaching up to find the cheekbone. Press that bone up and out. Repeat on the other side. Then place both thumbs on the upper palate (inside the mouth) and press the sides out. Several repetitions may be necessary. Relax and breath deep . Slowly inhale and exhale all the way out. Last but probably most important, make the necessary diet corrections . There is no substitute for water. When you are thirsty, it is not for coffee or soda, but water and only water. When you drink anything else, you need more water to flush that out. Drink half your body weight in ounces of water each day. Eating more vegetables and juicing are the best ways to correct nutritional deficiencies and correct your body's pH. Supplements help. Aromatherapy - Peppermint and lavender are used most often, but rosemary, eucalyptus, sandalwood, and basil often work well also.

0," Herbicides commonly used for both agriculture and home can induce antibiotic resistance in equally common disease-causing bacteria, according to a study conducted by researchers from Mexico and New Zealand and published in the journal mBio . 'Every day you see in the news that there are concerns about the ever increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance in bacteria that can cause disease in people and our animals,' researcher Jack Heinemann said in an interview with GMWatch . 'Anything that contributes to this problem should be considered because new antibiotics are rare.' Previous studies have repeatedly shown that non-antibiotic chemicals (such as aspirin) can modify the degree to which bacteria tolerate antibiotics. Biocidal chemicals in particular (such as pesticides) have previously been shown to induce resistance to multiple antibiotic drugs. Yet no prior studies had looked at whether herbicides might also have such an effect. No way to predict effects The study was conducted on two common bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (also known as Salmonella Typhimurium). Both are naturally found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals, including farm animals ( E. coli also naturally occurs in the human gut), and strains of both are major causes of food-borne illness. Salmonella Typhimurium is typically found in contaminated water, milk, poultry or beef, while disease-causing E. coli typically comes from undercooked beef or contaminated raw vegetables. Modern agricultural and food-production techniques have increased the spread of these pathogens. The researchers exposed the bacteria to three separate commercial herbicides , purchased at a local store: Kamba (active ingredient dicamba), 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and Roundup (glyphosate). The bacteria were exposed to five separate antibiotics, representing five different drug families: ampicillin (beta-lactams), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin (fluroquinolones), kanamycin (aminoglycosides) and tetracycline. The researchers found that, in many cases, the antibiotic resistance of the bacteria increased dramatically, up to sixfold. In some cases, the bacteria became more vulnerable, while in others they became more resistant. There was no way to predict the direction or scale of the change ahead of time; responses varied depending on the bacteria, antibiotic and herbicide involved. 'Thus, different potential disease-causing bacteria may react differently to the same herbicide or to the same antibiotic,' Heinemann said. The researchers then sent the original bacteria and chemicals to another researcher, who carried out a blinded replication. Her results were the same. Could drive evolution of superbugs In the study abstract, the authors note that herbicides and other biocides are not typically tested for 'sublethal effects on microbes,' such as those seen in the new study. Given the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, this is a major hole in current safety testing protocols. The herbicide concentrations used in the study were much higher than the residues found in food products but were less than the maximum application levels for home or agricultural use. Additionally, the antibiotic resistance properties of bacteria typically change when they are exposed to antibiotics and another chemical (in this case, herbicides) at the same time. Thus, the risk of herbicide-induced antibiotic resistance is greatest in agricultural settings, where both herbicides and antibiotics are in regular use. In certain cases, home use of herbicides could be a concern if a human or pet taking antibiotics were exposed to the chemicals. The researchers note that the change in antibiotic tolerance occurs faster than the lethal effects of the drugs. 'The magnitude of the induced response may undermine antibiotic therapy and substantially increase the probability of spontaneous mutation to higher levels of resistance,' the researchers wrote. 'The combination of high use of both herbicides and antibiotics in proximity to farm animals and important insects, such as honeybees, might also compromise their therapeutic effects and drive greater use of antibiotics.'

0," There is no need to get vaccinated against tuberculosis if you maintain high enough levels of vitamin D, suggests a new study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine . Researchers found that, in the presence of even minimally adequate levels of vitamin D, the body's own immune system will naturally trigger an immune response against the disease and many others without the need for drug or chemical interventions. Mario Fabri, who currently works in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Cologne in Germany, examined the effects of vitamin D on immunity during his time at the University of California, Los Angeles. He discovered that the vitamin D hormone is crucial for T-cells, which are the first responders to immune invaders, to produce a protein called interferon. And interferon has been shown to directly attack tuberculosis bacteria and prevent it from taking hold. 'Over the centuries, vitamin D has intrinsically been used to treat tuberculosis,' said Fabri, referencing the age-old practice of putting tuberculosis patients in areas of high sun exposure as part of their treatment. 'Our findings suggest that increasing vitamin D levels through supplementation may improve the immune response to infections such as tuberculosis.' Fabri's previous studies also found that vitamin D is necessary for the immune system to produce cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide that, like interferons, provides humans and other mammals with protection against bacterial infections. In other words, vitamin D equips the body with the tools it needs to prevent infection without the need for drug-based antibiotics. 'At a time when drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis are emerging, understanding how to enhance natural innate and acquired immunity through vitamin D may be very helpful,' added Barry Bloom, co-author of the study and former dean of faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health. What is even better is that interferons fight more than just tuberculosis . These powerful pathways of cell communication are known to exhibit an immune response to all sorts of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and even tumor cells, which means they can help prevent a host of other diseases besides just tuberculosis.

0," A team of European researchers has proven that eating strawberries will protect the stomach lining from damage caused by ethyl alcohol. 'A diet rich in strawberries might exert a beneficial effect in the prevention of gastric diseases related to generation of reactive oxygen species', the scientists conclude in the report. Strawberries boost our natural defenses Gastritis is an illness of the digestive system that occurs when the protective coating of the stomach becomes inflamed. This condition can be caused by alcohol intake, certain commonly used drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen, bacterial and viral infections, as well as autoimmune disorders or stress. The experiments were aimed at investigating the effects of the natural substances found in strawberries against ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage. Researchers tested the ability of these compounds to influence the free radicals present on the stomach's protective layers. The science team concluded that the substances in these berries can achieve more than their antioxidant role by also boosting the body's own natural defenses against various risk factors. The gastric mucosal barrier, the first line of defense against outside damaging factors, has been strengthened as a direct consequence of ingesting strawberries. 'The positive effects of strawberries are not only linked to their antioxidant capacity and high content of phenolic compounds (anthocyans) but also to the fact that they activate the antioxidant defenses and enzymes of the body', explain the scientists. The investigations were done 'in vivo' by using rats as subjects. Several groups were given a dose of 40 mg of strawberry extracts per kg of body weight, each day, for a period of 10 days. The rats were granted free access to food and water sources during the experiments. The extracts used were obtained from ripe strawberry fruits. Subsequently, the animals were given ethanol, which usually causes severe gastric damage. Scientists found that less ulcerations appear in the stomach of the rats that had been fed strawberries . This proves that the mammal digestive system is protected from the effects of alcohol through the use of active compounds found in strawberries. Strawberries fight against many health risks Free radicals have been identified as one of the main risk factors associated with gastritis as well as other diseases of the digestive tract. According to the scientists, strawberries are among the most important fruits when it comes to fighting this type of inflammation, due to their elevated content of essential nutrients and phytochemicals. The high content of flavonoids, tannins and phenolic acids is primarily responsible for the immunity boosting abilities of the fruits. These bioactive substances can scavenge active oxygen and prevent the onset of inflammations at a cellular level. 'This study was not conceived as a way of mitigating the effects of getting drunk but rather as a way of discovering molecules in the stomach membrane that protect against the damaging effects of differing agents' says professor Maurizio Battino, coordinator of the research group. The results obtained in this study can offer new perspectives on the treatment of ulcers and other inflammatory diseases of the stomach. Unlike traditional methods, 'the effect of strawberry intake may go further beyond the direct antioxidant effect', explain the scientists. However, strawberries do not suppress natural gastric acid secretion or the body's own antioxidant enzymes. "
0," Billed as the up-and-coming 'Amazon.com of the natural food industry,' the Green PolkaDot Box company has now opened its (online) doors and is shipping discounted foods, nutritional supplements, natural home care and personal care products straight to consumers at direct-to-consumer prices. Their launch was later than expected, of course. We had hoped they would be online in October, but it took some extra programming work to get their member rewards program working smoothly, and the good news is that members who joined a couple of months ago are now already accumulating rewards points and using them to get free groceries, supplements, superfoods and other health-enhancing products delivered to their front door (in green boxes, no less). I'm really happy to see Green PolkaDot Box launch. selfnews.com, the Organic Consumers Association and the Institute for Responsible Technology all got behind this concept several months ago, helping to publicize the upcoming launch of the company. We all believe that Whole Foods needs some competition to deliver organic products (and non-GMO products) at more competitive prices, and Green PolkaDot Box is suddenly positioned as the most promising company to take on that important role. Some in the industry taunted GPDB, pessimistically saying their concept could never be achieved and that they would never open their doors. But just a few days ago, the critics were silenced as GPDB opened its doors and began shipping out hundreds of orders! Right now, its members are saving money and even earning free groceries thanks to their referral rewards benefits (see below). How it works to save you money on the health-enhancing products you buy every day The Green PolkaDot Box is an online buyer's club, much like Costco or Sam's Club, but offering healthy products instead of conventional products. You pay a small fee to join, and then you start saving money immediately -- up to 60% off! -- on purchases of some of the best natural and organic products the industry has to offer. All orders over $150 are shipped FREE , so you pay no shipping in the USA. Right away, you can probably see how this could save you significant dollars over the next twelve months. But there's something even better in all this. As a rewards member with GPDB, you also earn rewards points on the groceries your friends buy -- or from anyone you tell about the website. So when they buy groceries at a discount, you get rewards points in YOUR account that you can then use to buy all the organic food products , superfoods, supplements, personal care products and other things you enjoy as part of your health lifestyle. (And their inventory is expanding every week to include a greater selection of natural health products, by the way...) In essence, you'll be earning FREE products as a referral benefit of introducing Green Polka Dot Box to others who may also want to save money on their own purchases of natural, organic and non-GMO products. This is a big deal, and it's a smart way to lower your grocery bill every month , or perhaps to finally afford the organic products that previously seemed too expensive. Click here to go to the GPDB website right now to join as a selfnews referral. ... and you can start saving today. Membership options and benefits - here's a 'loophole' that will disappear in 9 days At the GPDB website, you'll see three membership options . The Rewards Membership is the most popular option, but I want to explain the Founding Trust Membership because it's disappearing on December 31st (just a few days from now). This is the membership you want. That it even still exists is sort of a 'loophole,' because it was originally used as a special incentive program to raise operating capital for the company in its pre-launch phase. In exchange for people buying these memberships, they were offered extraordinary lifetime benefits which include deeper discounts on the products they buy, increased rewards points from referred members , and even a $500 rewards payback incentive that means you actually get $500 more worth of points than you pay for when you buy the membership. (Yeah, seriously.) This means this 'Founding Trust Membership' pays for itself -- and then pays you back $500 more -- instantly! It's a no brainer. It's like if you handed me a hundred dollar bill, and I handed you $125 in return. You'd be saying, 'Huh? Why did I just get 25% more money back than what I gave you?' And the answer is that this loophole is disappearing on December 31st , because it's literally too good to keep offering people. (Companies don't make money by giving away $500 worth of free groceries to new members... and that's why this 'loophole' is disappearing.) RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...)

The Founding Trust Memberships will be gone in just 9 days . They will never be offered again. No matter what you spend each month on foods, supplements, superfoods or personal care products, this membership pays for itself almost instantly, and then it keeps on saving you money -- or even earning you free products -- year after year. Join now as a selfnews referral at: www.GreenPolkaDotBox.com/selfnews Fresh, organic farm produce coming in 2012 By the way, on top of everything already mentioned here, GPDB will soon be announcing farm-to-consumer fresh produce shipped straight from America's farms to GPDB members, using an innovative chilling technique for the fresh produce. This means that, for the first time, many consumers will be able to get fresh, organic, non-GMO farm produce delivered straight to their door, at discount prices. This not only supports organic agriculture across America, but it makes buying organic produce both affordable and convenient. (As a GPDB rewards member, you'll earn rewards points on all the purchases of this fresh produce made by the people you refer.) But remember: selfnews always encourages you to buy LOCAL foods from local farmers first , so please visit your local CSAs, farmers' markets and food co-ops. Purchasing fresh produce via any other method should be secondary to getting it from local farmers. Quick answers for common questions What about the product selection? Will it be expanded? The product lineup at GPDB is being constantly expanded to add new brands, especially brands from small up-and-coming companies. Is GPDB an MLM? No, GPDB is not an MLM or a network marketing operation. It's a buyer's club with a referral rewards system, like an 'affiliate program.' Does GPDB oppose GMOs? Yes! The products carried by GPDB will continue to be scrutinized, expanded and improved every month. The intention of the company is to avoid carrying any GMOs, period. We'll help them accomplish that by monitoring their inventory for non-GMO compliance. Are all GPDB products organic? Not all products at GPDB are organic, but a huge portion of them are either certified organic or in transition to such certifications. The Organic Consumers Association is helping GPDB watch over its product selection to make sure, for instance, that 'organic' personal care products are truly organic and not just named 'organic' something. Does my membership help support selfnews? YES, if you join as a selfnews referral, then selfnews earns rewards points every time you shop at GPDB. We will put these rewards points to good use by turning them into cash and using that cash to expand our operation and keep fighting for food freedom, health freedom and the opposition of GMOs, chemical food additives (like MSG), dangerous pesticides and toxic chemicals such as fluoride. Will GPDB make any other improvements? Yes, and we plan to work with GPDB to help improve their store, improve product badges, and deliver educational content to their members. 9 days left to get the Founding Trust Membership To take advantage of all this, join as a Founding Trust Member now, before December 31st, when they will remove that membership option forever. The membership pays for itself -- PLUS $500 -- instantly.

0," Due to poor agricultural practices and excessive food processing, the food that ends up on our plate is typically a shadow of its former self in regards to nutritional content. To make matters worse, we tend to cook these nutrient deprived foods and further destroy their nutritional value. To ensure you get the most nutrition out of your food, focus on buying clean, whole foods, and use these 4 methods to expand their nutritional benefits. Fermenting Fermenting foods could be one of the most economical and powerful ways to introduce incredible nutrition to your body. Fermenting is simply a culturing process that produces beneficial bacteria that are very important in maintaining a healthy gut flora balance. Introducing them to your diet will improve the function of your digestive and immune system, your liver, and your brain! As an example, sauerkraut (fermented cabbage) is a source of many nutrients including: - Vitamin B1, B6, and B9 - Vitamin C and K - Manganese, magnesium, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron However, even more important is the amount of live probiotics and enzymes in unpasteurized sauerkraut, which makes these nutrients highly bioavailable to the human body. Juicing Another great way to get more nutrition on a daily basis is by juicing fruits and vegetables. Although this doesn't provide more nutrition, it does allow you to eat more fruits and vegetables and reach the recommended amount of servings each day with relative ease. Not only that, but juicing makes the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes in produce much easier to assimilate, as they go straight into your system without having to be broken down. With the sad state of digestive systems today, there are varying limitations on what the digestive system can absorb, but juicing helps bypass that problem by liberating key nutrients from the tough plant cell walls for you so you get the most out of your fruits and vegetables. Sprouting Sprouting is something very few people do, but it is another exceptional way to deliver a concentrated source of nutrition that is different from eating the plant in its mature form. To highlight this point, analyze the nutritional profile of wheat grass compared to the full-grown wheat plant, and you will get an idea of the nutrition that the sprout of a plant can deliver. Sprouts are ideal for improving your health because they are a highly digestible source of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, proteins, beneficial enzymes, and phytochemicals. Sprouted foods have five to ten times higher B-vitamins, and twice the vitamin A, C, zinc, calcium and iron content of their non-sprouted counterparts. Per calorie, sprouts may be arguably the most efficient form of nutrition, and they are very easy and economical to produce in your home. Blending Blending doesn't necessarily get you more nutrition out of your food, but it does allow you to combine more beneficial ingredients that don't otherwise go together to create an incredibly nutritious snack or meal. For example, creating a superfood smoothie can deliver a massive array of nutrients (even more than juicing) in about 5 minutes preparation time. Blending also allows you to make incredibly nourishing and easily digestible vegetable soups, so your body can easily assimilate all the beneficial nutrients. Out of all these practices, the most economical (for food costs, time invested, and long term storage capabilities) solution would be fermenting.

0," The Mississippi River continues to rise, and many areas around Memphis, Tenn., as well as in other states, have already been evacuated. Reports indicate that the Mississippi River has already crested 14 feet above flood stage, and it has done so days before experts predicted it. At the current accelerated rate of flooding, the river will exceed the 1937 flood record, which rose 14.7 feet above flood stage and destroyed 20 million acres of land, within just a few days ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/201... ). 'This water that we're seeing coming by is moving two million cubic feet per second,' explained Col. Vernie Reichling from the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) to reporters. 'To use an analogy, in one second that water would fill up a football field 44 feet deep.' Other reports indicate that Vicksburg, Miss., is expected to see record cresting of 57.5 feet on May 18 in that area ( http://beta.clarionledger.com/article/201105... ), and all along the river, towns and cities are having to prepare as best they can for the coming floods. ACE has already detonated the Birds Point levee in Missouri ( http://www.selfnews.com/032259_New_Madrid... ), released the Bonnet Carre Spillway in New Orleans ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/05/09/midwest... ), and it may demolish several other levees as well in an attempt to divert flood waters from cities and towns. 'We cannot get to the parks, which is underwater, or to other towns,' said one man from Murphysboro, Ill., to CNN. 'Most of the roads are closed, plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged. (If) the sewage plant shuts down, we won't have tap water to bathe in or drink.' Many areas of Memphis are already flooded or beginning to flood, and officials have been going door-to-door urging area residents in high-risk areas to evacuate. The worst is yet to come, however, as flood waters are expected to continue rising, affecting at least four million people living in and around the Mississippi River region stretching from Illinois all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico.

0," A Yale study is shining new light on the complexity of the canine mind. In more ways than one, man's best friend is trying to communicate with his master. Dogs not only observe human behavior but seem to engage in a moral evaluation of the people nearest them. Yale Researchers have put hundreds of dogs to the test in new cognitive interactive studies that investigate just how the canine's mind's function. Laurie Santos, director of the Yale Canine Cognition Center, says that hundreds of dogs were placed in front of puppet shows that would typically evoke an emotional response. The dogs responded to the puppets' actions in interesting ways that point to their ability to morally evaluate. 'Dogs are just fascinating,' Santos said. 'We love them, they live in our homes. Anyone who hangs out with a dog is kind of wondering, 'what are they thinking, do they love me'.' Dogs dislike bully-like activity Some tests proved that dogs do show empathetic love in certain situations. In one puppet show cognitive test, each dog watched as a rat puppet helped a hedgehog puppet up a hill. During another test, dogs watched as that same rat puppet knocked the hedgehog puppet back down the hill. 'Similar studies have been done with human infants, and what we find is that infants don't like the guy who was mean,' Santos said. 'So, we're doing the same thing with dogs to try and see if dogs morally evaluate, the way humans do.' Just like infants, most canines in the study became wary of the rat puppet who knocked the hedgehog puppet down the hill. Dogs become wary of thieves, mischievous activity In another test, the dogs were placed in front of a companion sitting and reading a book. When the companion sat the book down on the floor behind their chair, a stranger was allowed into the room to take the book. 'What we really want to see is whether or not dogs know when we've missed some information,' Santos said. 'Do they realize that, first of all, and when they do realize it, are they motivated to help?' The common theme that the canine's shared was their ability to recognize that something was wrong when a stranger came in to take the book. Furthermore, the dogs seemed to take their care to another level. Most attempted to alert their companions that something was wrong. The dogs' ability to not only pay attention but also to recognize that something is wrong indicates that they can morally evaluate people in the room they are in. Dogs care about what their companion values In a third test, Yale researchers allowed a dog and their companion in a room. While the two are relaxing, a researcher walks in and introduces a new object to both. Researchers attempted to see whether the dog would become interested in the same item as their companion. Most of the dogs studied did take a liking to the new object along with their companion. 'The most surprising thing so far is how many of our intuitions about dogs are right,' Yale junior Rebecca Spaulding said. 'That dogs have feelings and dogs want to communicate with us.' "
0," Right now in New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and a growing number of other cities, tens of thousands of protestors of all stripes and political persuasions are marching in protest of the corporate corruption that has infiltrated and taken control of the US government -- and the mainstream media (MSM), of course, has been virtually absent in covering this massive and escalating demonstration against the current state of US politics. The ongoing demonstrations, which are part of a new movement called Occupy Wall Street (OWS), have already resulted in numerous cases of violent police abuses, the shutting down of the Brooklyn Bridge, and even the voluntary arrival of members of the US armed forces who have reportedly come to help protest and protect protestors from attacks by local law enforcement. Most Americans still have no idea that the protests, which officially began on September 17, 2011, are even taking place, though, because the MSM has been too busy focusing on the next presidential election cycle and other safe, pre-planned news segments. But the events are getting so large and disruptive that the media will be unable to ignore them for too much longer. While not everybody involved in the OWS movement is necessarily fighting against totalitarian government and for true freedom and liberty -- InfoWars explains that many protestors are actually demanding bigger government and higher taxes as a solution ( http://www.infowars.com/occupy-wall-street-p... ) -- some of the protestors do appear to understand that big government is the problem, and not the answer. But regardless of what the protestors believe as a whole, they still have every right to peacefully gather and protest without being abused by their own government. And unfortunately many protestors' constitutional rights have been violated, as early reports and video clips that spread like wildfire on YouTube showed police pepper spraying protestors and aggressively arresting individuals for no apparent reason ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/se... ). Then on Saturday, a group of US Army and Marine troops reportedly traveled to New York to help support the movement and offer protection for protestors against police abuse. One Army serviceman by the name of Ward Reilly posted a message on Facebook on his way to the protests saying, 'I didn't fight for Wall St. I fought for America. Now it's Congress' turn,' a sentiment apparently shared by the other servicemen veterans traveling to protest locations ( http://antinewworldorderparty.wordpress.com/... ). Throughout the week, we will be covering the day-to-day happenings associated with OWS that the MSM is ignoring, so stay tuned for more updates.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Have you been influenced by modern allopathic medicine's obsession with lowering fever? Has this been a concern of yours? Ever since the turn of the 20th century, using drugs to lower fevers has been standard operating procedure for most allopathic medicine practitioners. Take two aspirins and call me in the morning was a common medical humor gag throughout the 1950's. Aspirin type medications may be needed for pain reduction, but when it comes to reducing fever from influenza of any type, taking an over the counter drug to reduce fever is not the way to go. Suppressing fevers can increase rapid viral replication, resulting in a berserk effort by an overwhelmed immune system to fight back. This is known as a cytokine storm, which can have disastrous results. What Fever Is Actually About This section gets a tad technical. According to former NASA scientist, researcher, and editor for www.brojon.org , Marshall Smith explains in his article 'The Tamiflu Myth' that 'The body causes a fever above 101 degrees which stops the telomeres on the ends of the virus from allowing any viral replication.' [Note: Telomeres are chromosome caps to keep chromosome threads from randomly sticking together.] Fever is the immune system's response in addition to sending T-Cells to fight antibodies. The T-Cells can kill bacterial pathogens. Those pathogens are killable by T-Cell attacks. Fevers are also part of the clean up process for toxic bacterial waste products. Viruses are not living microorganisms that rummage about internally looking for food to scavenge, as bacteria do. A virus does not have a nucleus cell that divides to create more microbes, as bacteria do. The body's thalamus/thyroid reaction raises the temperature slightly, and that stops viruses from replicating. Great, but what's the difference between bacterial cell division and viral replication, and why can't the T-Cells get all those viruses anyway? Marshall Smith explains the virus replication process: 'When a virus enters one of your cells, it escapes from within its own old protein surface coating and it stretches out into a long string. The viral DNA then collects millions of free amino acids floating in your salty cell fluid to make a mirror image copy of the four types of amino acids in the viral chain. This reversed mirror image chain is called Retro-deoxy-ribo Nucleic Acid or shortened to RNA .' 'The RNA molecule is special and continues to make another mirror image of itself which is, of course, an exact copy of the original viral DNA. This unique method of making a mirror image of a mirror image to make an exact copy of the original viral DNA is the only method a virus can use to make copies. This is called Replication.' Smith continues, 'The RNA molecule string will then continue to make many, many copies . . . This starves your cell of all the amino acids and in a matter of minutes, destroys it. The original virus and its many replicate copies are now free to invade your other body cells. . . . the thousands of new viral DNA copies then steal pieces of the protein bag coating from your damaged and dying cell, and then covers the viral DNA with stolen cell wall material. . . . the virus then hides from your immune system, since the virus now looks like just one of your own friendly cells and not a dangerous foreign virus.' Therefore, since these viruses can be so sneaky and replicate so rapidly, the T-Cell antibody actions so successful with bacteria invasions may prove to be futile against viruses. It's the rise in body temperature that halts viral replication by inhibiting the DNA strand telomeres from capturing the free amino acids needed to replicate. Any attempt to reduce fever during a viral influenza attack may accelerate the virus's rapid replication and produce viral pneumonia or worse. Leave the fever alone to stop the viral replication process is Marshall Smith's message. Fever Phobia in Pediatrics The frantic effort to reduce fever with children under six years of age is alarming. Not only parents, but many doctors fall into this fever phobia phenomena. There is a Meningitis concern. So if there are convulsions from the child's rise in temperature, that concern could be checked to exclude Meningitis as the source of convulsions. However, the occurrence of Meningitis is actually extremely rare. Only 5% to 10% of children under six get febrile convulsions, which usually last for a few minutes. The commonly misdirected concern is that a high fever in a young child can create brain damage. The actual situation is that vaccinations and other illnesses are the real causes of brain damage, not the fever itself. The fever phobia has led parents and maybe some doctors to alternate Tylenol with Advil or any Ibuprofen in a desperate effort to reduce fevers. This effort has occasionally resulted in more serious damage, sometimes death. Even the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against these desperate measures to reduce fever. They advise sticking with one medication, using conservative doses carefully. A Blast From the Past - Feed a Cold; Starve a Fever Remember that one? Well there is truth in it. Lena Sanchez, a retired RN medical office administrator, now holistic healer and author of Antibiotic Alternatives to Preventing Mega Bacteria, confirms this from her 30 years of experience. Her experience was that most patients, especially mothers of young patients, would panic over fevers and insist something be done to lower the temperature. Doctors often foolishly succumbed to their pleas. Lena Sanchez's stance is that fever is part of the immune system's clean up from bacteria waste products or an attempt to halt viral replication. Either way, fever needs to be there and not minimized by drugs. It is extremely rare that a fever will exceed 106 degrees Fahrenheit or 41 degrees Celsius. But while it may be okay for a person with a common cold and very little (under 101 F or 38 C) or no fever to eat or be fed, a solid fever does need to be starved, especially if viral influenza is being experienced. The liver is the clearing house for both digestion and detox. Lena Sanchez recommends fasting on very light broths and purified water to assist an overburdened liver during the fever process of getting rid of the body's microbe waste materials. She also recommends enemas, which could shorten the fast. She has seen pneumonia patients who were encouraged to eat more get worse and even die. She claims this only serves to push the disease one's fever is fighting deeper. And of course, she has seen several who followed her suggestion of starving the fever get thoroughly well quicker. Another Blast from the Past - Sweat It Out It was quite common for many to observe that by not trying to cool off, and by actually bundling up more and allowing the body heat to induce even sweating, that the next day the fever broke or reduced significantly. But even with that, the notion was to break the fever. What was really happening was that by encouraging the fever to completely take over, the fever did its job and was no longer needed! An American practitioner of Chinese Medicine, Karen S. Vaughan, advises, 'Initial levels of both Wind heat and Wind cold [Chinese Medicine terms describing underlying situations that induce fever] are treated by inducing sweating. You would take a warm bath, cover yourself with quilts and go to bed drinking the teas. 'If the disease is not treated at this level or is treated inappropriately then it will penetrate to more internal levels and you will need strong antimicrobial herbs that drain the pathogens through the bowels and the urine.' Often a fever is accompanied by chills, even to the point of shivering. That makes it easy to bundle up and sweat! But sometimes that is not the case. Then it takes a willful effort to follow the bundle up and sweat protocol. So never mind breaking the fever with or without medication as the goal. Let the fever help you heal. All the sources cited for this article tend to agree. It's the condition of the patient that matters more than the fever. Someone who is very ill without fever (under 101 F or 38 C) should cause more concern than someone running a high fever but resting well while taking in fluids and eating little. An Exception This is not to say that if you are unfortunate enough to suffer a Swine Flu vaccination in the near future you should ignore a possible cytokine storm reaction. Such a probable event is the berserk T-Cell reaction to being overwhelmed by the vaccine adjunct squalene. It actually causes the immune system to become your worst enemy, attacking healthy nerve and lung tissue, and possibly resulting in permanent internal injury, such as Guillian-Barre Syndrome (paralysis), or death from destroyed lungs. Dr. Russell Blaylock outlined a protocol for this, which is detailed in the selfnews article Urgent: 'What To Do If You Cannot Avoid the Flu Shots . . . ' linked here: http://www.selfnews.com/027106_vaccinatio... A major point to distinguish between ordinary fever and cytokine storm reaction is from Dr. Blaylock's description (in the video interview linked under sources of the above article) of noticing how cold packs placed on infants' points of inoculation in pediatric wards would calm down hysterical, screaming and thrashing infants. Those are not just regular fever reactions. Those are cytokine storms. This cold pack technique is what he recommends you do upon receiving a vaccination, along with a list of natural supplements to help you avert that cytokine storm. Other than that, fever is your friend.

0," If the Food and Drug Administration and Congress get their way, it will become much easier for the mainstream psychiatry community to utilize unregulated, dangerous electroshock therapy, even though it has been proven to be ineffective and mentally damaging in the past. An alert sent out by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights International, a mental health watchdog group, says that the FDA is seeking to lower the classification of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) devices from the highest Class III rating to Class II, the same category as air purifiers and contact lenses. 'Any medical experts, healthcare professionals, lawyers, ECT survivors and their families/friends that could provide knowledge of the damage ECT causes should comment and oppose the ECT device being rated as Class II for the treatment of any mental disorder,' says the alert. According to the proposed rule change [ here ], the devices are being reclassified 'for use in treating severe major depressive episode (MDE) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BPD) in patients 18 years of age and older who are treatment-resistant or who require a rapid response due to the severity of their psychiatric or medical condition ... based on new information.' 'The FDA is doing this despite 3,045 people responding to an earlier public docket on ECT in 2009, of which 79% opposed reclassification and only 14% supported it and where 1,857 or 61% of the respondents reported a negative effective from ECT ,' CCHRI stated. What's more, the group said, the FDA is well aware of the health risks in using ECT devices. Meaningless 'special controls' 'The FDA admits in the Proposal that there are risks of irregular heartbeat or ischemia/infarction (i.e., heart attack); high or low blood pressure; cognitive and memory impairment, 'ECT treatment may result in the development of hypomanic or manic symptoms,' prolonged seizures, moderate pain following the induced seizure and Death may result from various complications of ECT such as reactions to anesthesia, cardiovascular complications, pulmonary complications, or stroke,' said the organization. CCHRI said the FDA denies that the devices can cause brain damage, even though patients who had received ECT treatment have testified otherwise. What's more, the FDA's claims that it will impose 'special controls' on the devices is largely meaningless, the group said, noting they were largely 'labeling provisions' to include: -- Disclosure of contraindications, precautions, warnings, and potential adverse effects/complications...and patients can be advised of conditions under which ECT treatment should not proceed; -- Specific device use instructions including information regarding conduct of pre-ECT patient assessments; and information on appropriate patient monitoring during an ECT procedure) to minimize potential ECT procedural complications. The mental health watchdog said the FDA's reclassification of the devices would not include treatment for other mental disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar manic states, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and catatonia. The agency proposes to leave the devices at the Class III level, meaning they would require a Premarket Approval (PMA) within 90 days. However, the watchdog said, the FDA has known since 1979 that 'device manufacturers have refused to [submit PMAs] and the companies and psychiatrists from the American Psychiatric Association claim its 'too expensive' for the manufacturers to conduct clinical trials.' No oversight 'Additionally, the FDA states that it did not find sufficient evidence to show that even with 'special controls' implemented, the device would be safe and effective for these other disorders (but apparently it's OK to administer hundreds of volts of electricity if you are older than 18 with either or both of the specified disorders),' CCHRI said. In addition to the proposed rule change, Medicine.news reported in January that legislation has been introduced in Congress to relax medical device standards. That bill, the 21st Century Cures Act , introduced by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., would essentially allow medical devices to be used on patients without their prior consent. The measure completely 'relaxes scientific standards, virtually guaranteeing insufficiently tested drugs will hit the market only to be recalled after the damage is done,' says Lee Spiller, CCHRI's executive director.

0," Bees are important , not just for their ability to churn honey, but for our very livelihood. Without bees, we wouldn't be here. And yet, bees are in trouble . According to a recent study co-authored by a University of Guelph professor, even low levels of herbicides can affect the foraging abilities of bumblebees to extract nectar and pollen. Both wild and domestic honey bees account for approximately 80 percent of global pollination. Just one bee colony can pollinate 300 million flowers in a day. Greenpeace estimates that 70 of the top 100 human food crops are pollinated by bees, and these crops represent about 90 percent of the world's nutrition supply. Albert Einstein noted that if the bees were to vanish from the face of the Earth, mankind would face extinction. Unfortunately, Einstein's warning has not been taken seriously enough. The worldwide bee colony is collapsing, thanks to habitat loss and the use of herbicides. Bumble trouble In the resent study, published in the journal Functional Ecology , researchers sought to analyze the impact of low levels of herbicides on bee production. Bumblebees were exposed to common levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide known as thiamethoxam. The study was the first to investigate the impact pesticides have on bumblebees' ability to forage from common wild flowers with complex shapes. The researchers found that it took herbicide-exposed bees longer to collect pollen from a different flower than controlled bees. In addition, the pesticide-exposed bees decided to forage from a different flower than the controlled bees. 'Bees rely on learning to locate flowers, track their profitability and work out how best to efficiently extract nectar and pollen,' said environmental sciences professor and senior author of the paper, Nigel Raine. 'If exposure to low levels of pesticide affects their ability to learn, bees may struggle to collect food and impair the essential pollination services they provide to both crops and wild plants,' he added. Previous studies have verified that exposure to neonicotinoid herbicides can alter the chemistry of the brain, particularly in areas linked to memory and learning in honeybees. In the recent study, herbicide-exposed bumblebees collected more pollen than control bees, but the control bees were able to learn how to extract nectar from intricate flowers after a few visits. Lead author, Dara Stanley, of Royal Holloway University in London, told sources, 'Bumblebees exposed to pesticide initially foraged faster and collected more pollen. However unexposed bees may be investing more time and energy in learning. Our findings have important implications for society and the economy as pollinating insects are vital to support agriculture and wild plant biodiversity.' Adding to these remarks, Raine said that more realistic field research is needed into the relationship between herbicides , bumblebees and other wild pollinators. 'Our results suggest that current levels of pesticide exposure could be significantly affecting how bees are interacting with wild plants, and impairing the crucial pollination services they provide that support healthy ecosystem function,' he said. In other words, if herbicides hinder bumblebees' ability to learn and adapt, then wild bees could become increasingly sensitive to changes in the environment. According to a separate review, an estimated 57 different herbicides are poisoning European honey bees, which is contributing to the rapidly declining bee population worldwide. What can be done? In 2013, Europe enforced an unprecedented two year continent-wide ban on three neonicotinoid herbicides believed to harm bees. Unfortunately, the U.S. has failed to make similar strides in protecting the bee population. In 2014, President Obama signed the Monsanto Protection Act , which gave biotech companies immunity from the havoc their commercial compounds wreak on people and the environment in federal U.S. courts. Although the nature of the problem is complex, the solution is simple. The global bee population can be restored by banning dangerous herbicides, and preserving wild bee habitats. If such practices aren't put in place, bees won't be the only species to bear the sting of extinction .

0," The research is preliminary and the results inconclusive, but scientists believe several factors are related to repeated exposure to combat conditions could be causing premature aging among many of our nation's veterans, though some believe the cause could be much more sinister. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and battlefield concussion are common elements of these repeated deployments, say doctors and scientists who have discovered many physical characteristics of aging found in older adults but which are more frequently being discovered in veterans who are in their 20s and 30s. 'Scientists see early signs of heart disease and diabetes, slowed metabolisms and obesity - maladies more common to middle age or later,' said USA Today , in reporting the results. 'They should have been in the best shape of their lives,' William Milberg, a Harvard Medical School professor of psychology and co-director of the project tracking the veterans' physical changes, told the paper. 'The big worry, of course, is we're going to be taking care of them until they're in their 70s. What's going to happen to them in the long run?' Again, scientists admit the research is in its very earliest stages, but already researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs are rushing to figure it out. What they appear to be seeing are distinct signs of early aging, and if that's the case, they say the signs are occurring most commonly among veterans with both blast-related concussions and PTSD - about 30 percent of all veterans being studied in the long-term research project. Hundreds of thousands of potential sufferers Researchers say they are discovering signs of diminished gray matter in higher-functioning portions of the brain, changes that normally occur much later in life, if at all. The scientists say they are likely to need a few more years of study to prove their anti-aging theory, but add that it's not clear how their findings will impact future policies regarding the number and length of combat deployments. Many veterans have a combination of three, four and even five combat deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Even before reports about the potentially aging effects of repeated deployments were known, the Army seemed to be mindful of the strain of repeated tours of duty. About a year ago, the service branch began cutting deployments to just nine months from a year (initial deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan were 15 months for some Army troops), and have lengthened the time between deployments. Some regular Army and Marine Corps units were once being rotated into war zones every 12 months or so; National Guard troops were eligible to be deployed again after 24 months. Meanwhile, the numbers of troops suffering brain injury and PTSD continue to grow. The Department of Defense said that since 2000, 244,000 service members have suffered traumatic brain injuries which ranged from mild to severe, both in and out of combat. Since the 9/11 attacks, the VA says it has treated about the same number of war veterans for PTSD. 'We're looking at people who are going to be having cognitive problems much earlier than they should be having them,' said Regina McGlinchey, a neuropsychologist and project co-director. There is other anecdotal evidence that premature aging may be occurring among some veterans. A study released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that veterans aged 25 to 64 experienced more than twice the rate of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and cancer than non-veterans. Military vaccines suspected Milberg said people researchers are seeing in Boston 'really have a lot of things going on at the same time. It's hard to know where one problem ends and another starts.' He went onto say that other scientists say the early aging may stem from the nature of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; troops have served long and repeated deployments to both conflicts, and at an unprecedented rate. While there, they live under a high state of vigilance, manage a much higher-than-normal level of stress for many months or even more than a year - then have had to do it all over again perhaps only a year later. But some veterans believe there could be a much more sinister reason behind the physical disabilities. 'Take a deeper look down the 'rabbit hole'' said one Facebook poster to the original USA Today article. 'I am a disabled vet myself. All the stuff they shot into us, the chemicals. We're walking guinea pigs for every pharma/bioweapon coming down the pike. These 'wars' are unnecessary.'

0," For centuries, shiitake mushrooms ( Lentinula edodes ) have been utilized as a medicine in their native East Asia. Traditional Chinese medicine, for instance, would commonly prescribe shiitake for people suffering from upper respiratory disease, poor blood circulation and fatigue. In Japan, shiitake were beloved for their anti-aging properties. And Europeans, who have rigorously studied shiitake under the microscope since they first arrived on the continent, appreciate their impressive cholesterol lowering and weight loss properties. However, an American study published in the Cancer Prevention Research journal has also found that a compound present in shiitake mushrooms can suppress the rate of cervical cancer growth, making them a viable alternative for aggressive and unnatural allopathic cancer treatments. AHCC vs. HPV According to the study authors, shiitake mushrooms contain an alpha-glucan called active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), which is a mixture of amino acids, polysaccharides and minerals. This compound, which appears to be unique to shiitake, is well known for its anti-tumor benefits. With this information in mind, the researchers sought to determine whether AHCC could also eradicate human papillomavirus (HPV), an extremely common sexually-transmitted infection which, if left untreated, can cause women to develop cervical cancer. For the study, the researchers treated two cervical cancer cells (SiHa [HPV 16/18 positive] and C-33A [HPV negative]) in vitro with a 0.42 mg/mL dose of AHCC, then incubated them for 72 hours. Two additional trials followed: one in which the same AHCC dose was repeated once every 24 hours for one week, and another in which mice suffering from HPV were fed a 50 mg/kg dose of AHCC daily for the same period. The results showed that AHCC suppressed HPV in all three trials. In the first trial, the AHCC suppressed HPV expression during the first 24 hours, but the HPV came back with a vengeance during the next 24 hours. Fortunately, continuous in vitro exposure -- such as that experienced in the other two trials -- resulted in sustained HPV suppression. Specifically, sustained AHCC treatment resulted in an overall 15.9 percent decrease in HPV activity compared to the control groups. '[T]hese data suggest daily dosing of AHCC will eradicate HPV 16/18 infections and may have a role in the prevention of HPV-related cervical cancer ,' concluded Dr. Judith Smith, lead researcher and scientist at the University of Texas . 'Furthermore, there is a potential for the addition of AHCC to primary treatment regimens for cervical cancer , which may potentially improve response rates and prevent recurrence.' Dr. Smith's findings were presented at the Society of Gynecological Oncology's 45th Annual Meeting on Women's Cancer in Tampa, Florida in March 2014. "
0," The more the statists who run California try to create the ultimate utopian paradise, the further away from it they seem to get. Case in point: San Francisco's uber-liberal politicians have made it so politically incorrect to adequately deal with the city's rising homeless population that the number of homeless people continues to rise. The increasing number of homeless is creating a major public health problem in a state that just passed a mandatory vaccine law. As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle , the homeless openly defecate and urinate on city streets and sometimes do even worse things. As the holiday shopping season approaches and Super Bowl 50 comes right on its heels, officials are finding themselves in a quandary over a situation they created. As noted by The Bold Italic , 22 percent of the nation's homeless live in California; a great deal of them live in San Francisco. The publication also notes that in San Francisco alone, the city has enacted scores of ordinances that ostensibly criminalize the kinds of 'quality of life' violations mentioned above. Nevertheless, the homeless population has not dissipated. In fact, it has actually grown somewhat. San Francisco has yet to renew a ten-year plan that was enacted to deal with its homeless that just expired. As part of that plan, thousands of permanent residences were built to house the homeless, and thousands more are still needed. Off the street... but to where? The city's mayor, Ed Lee, has proclaimed that the homeless must be off the street before Super Bowl 50, the NFL's premier game watched by more than 100 million people. It will be played in the new Levi's Stadium, which opened in July 2014. 'We'll give you an alternative,' Lee said when he was asked whether the sidewalk sleepers will have to go before fans descend in the thousands ahead of the Super Bowl. 'We are always going to be supportive. But you are going to have to leave the street. Not just because it is illegal, but because it is dangerous.' The idea is to temporarily house the homeless in the new Navigation Center in the Mission District, where they can live while they are routed into more permanent housing, rehabilitation, jobs, and other services. Some of them could end up in an estimated 500 units of supportive housing the mayor wants to have refurbished and open by year's end. 'Some of them are mentally ill. Some of them have severe drug addiction,' Lee said of the homeless who sleep on the street. 'They get cleaned up for 24 hours, and then they are back on the environment that caused this in the first place.' One mayoral candidate, a comedian named Stuart Schuffman aka 'Broke A** Stuart,' has suggested providing tax breaks to businesses that let homeless people inside to 'pee for free.' Free housing that will be subsidized by San Francisco taxpayers and other incentives to stop the homeless from excreting urine and feces on city streets have not done much to stop the stench or the spread of disease, nor is it likely to work any time soon. Making a bad problem worse Some homeless advocates say there isn't much serious effort on the part of local politicians. 'Homeless people are used as scapegoats by politicians on a frequent basis,' Jennifer Friedenbach, head of the nonprofit Coalition on Homelessness, told the San Francisco Examiner last year. As The Bold Italic added, ordinances don't seem to be doing much good: Being a scapegoat also means getting ticketed for sitting or sleeping in public places, although it's unclear what reasonable alternative exists for most people on the street. [A recent] report finds that homeless people aren't likely to appear in court to resolve or protest fines, which could lead to a bench warrant or even arrest at the discretion of the officer. Even if officers spend only 10 minutes writing a citation, over the course of a year that adds up to potentially hundreds of hours diverted from more urgent issues on the street. In the meantime, without any real plan to reduce its mounting homeless population, the utopia of San Francisco is slowing deteriorating into just another liberal American city that is unable to cope with the reality of its own left-wing making.

0," The protests and demonstrations currently taking place on the campus of the formerly sedate University of Missouri are rife with hypocrisy and irony for any fair-minded person who wishes to take a serious look at what's actually going on. In the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans would have loved to have had fair-minded coverage of their struggle for civil rights during what became one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history since the end of the Civil War. Today, however, on the campus of MU, they are joining Left-wing radicals who are part of the university in chasing the media away, and resorting to force if necessary because suddenly, the media doesn't make them feel 'safe.' In recent days, a mob of protesters gathered on the university's main quad to cheer the resignation of Mizzou president Tim Wolfe after he announced that he was stepping down from his post (which he was essentially forced out of). Students complained about an alleged lack of action over hurt feelings in recent months, including allegations that racial slurs were used against students of color and the discovery of a swastika made of feces in a dorm bathroom. 'My motivation in making this decision comes from love,' Wolfe said to reporters and others following his announcement. 'I love MU, Columbia where I grew up, the state of Missouri.' Behaving as the intolerant mob they used to detest His resignation was followed by that of the school's chancellor, R. Bowen Loftin, who said he was going to transition into a research position. These were the major demands of students the resignation of Wolfe, especially but as it turns out, the intolerance of the mob has only grown and, some observers say, will spread to other institutions around the country. As reported by The Daily Beast , protesters many of them African American formed a human circle around the main protest site, public property which they claimed as their 'safe' zone, refusing to allow media personnel inside to interview participants and take photos. On several occasions, protesters got physical with reporters and cameramen, pushing them back and walling them off with a phalanx of bodies and shouting them down when the reporters claimed the right to occupy public space. 'We calling the police because you aren't respecting us,' shouted one protester at a member of the media, while ironically joining in to disrespect the reporters. 'This guy shouldn't be here,' said another protester, who was later identified on Twitter as Dr. Melissa A. Click , Assistant Professor of Mass Media in the university's Communications Department (talk about irony). She shuffled a member of the press outside the immense circle of linked arms shouting, 'And don't let him back in!' Today's 'civil rights movement' isn't about 'equality' Others then began a brief chant of 'No Comment,' while still another protested claimed, 'They'd just get the headline wrong anyway,' not realizing for a second that by helping others deny reporters' First Amendment rights, they were in the process of making headlines already. Even some members of the Mizzou football team, including both black and white players, joined in and said they would not play another snap unless changes were made and Wolfe resigned. Now that he has, the team members have rejoined the program though the act likely cost the team some alumni support and created future recruiting problems. One player, ESPN reported, even said that half the team members and coaches were not supportive of the walkout, that they were actually 'pissed' about it, and that it wouldn't have happened if the team's record this year was better. 'If we were 9-0, this wouldn't be happening,' the player, who is white but was not identified, told the sports network. Demands have also grown; here is a list of them . Included are 'demands' for Wolfe to 'acknowledge his white male privilege'; implement racial reforms dating back to 1969 and 'comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum' that is 'mandatory' for all 'students, faculty, staff, and administration' and administrated by 'a board comprised of students, staff, and faculty of color'; and implement 'a strategic 10 year plan by May 1, 2016 that will increase retention rates for marginalized students' (in other words, allow failing students to remain and actually graduate, even though they have not achieved passing academic standards). In the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans had legitimate cause to protest and seek additional civil rights guarantees, but those rights have long been established and numerous additional protections have been added since. Today, many still act as though the civil rights movement never took place, but they are no longer demanding 'equality,' either. They are demanding they be treated better than everyone else, and frankly, that's not 'equality' that's racism, precisely what they claim to be battling.

0," A new vaccine for influenza has hit the market, and it is the first ever to contain genetically-modified (GM) proteins derived from insect cells. According to reports, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the vaccine, known as Flublok, which contains recombinant DNA technology and an insect virus known as baculovirus that is purported to help facilitate the more rapid production of vaccines. According to Flublok's package insert, the vaccine is trivalent, which means it contains GM proteins from three different flu strains. The vaccine's manufacturer, Protein Sciences Corporation (PSC), explains that Flublok is produced by extracting cells from the fall armyworm, a type of caterpillar, and genetically altering them to produce large amounts of hemagglutinin, a flu virus protein that enables the flu virus itself to enter the body quickly. So rather than have to produce vaccines the 'traditional' way using egg cultures, vaccine manufacturers will now have the ability to rapidly produce large batches of flu virus protein using GMOs, which is sure to increase profits for the vaccine industry. But it is also sure to lead to all sorts of serious side effects, including the deadly nerve disease Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GSB), which is listed on the shot as a potential side effect. 'If Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) has occurred within six weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give Flublock should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks,' explains a section of the vaccine's literature entitled 'Warnings and Precautions.' Other potential side effects include allergic reactions, respiratory infections, headaches, fatigue, altered immunocompetence, rhinorrhea, and myalgia. According to clinical data provided by PSC in Flublok's package insert, two study participants actually died during trials of the vaccine . But the company still insists Flublok is safe and effective, and that it is about 45 percent effective against all strains of influenza in circulation, rather than just one or two strains. FDA also approves flu vaccine containing dog kidney cells Back in November, the FDA also approved a new flu vaccine known as Flucelvax that is actually made using dog kidney cells. A product of pharmaceutical giant Novartis, Flucelvax also does away with the egg cultures, and can similarly be produced much more rapidly than traditional flu vaccines, which means vaccine companies can have it ready and waiting should the federal government declare a pandemic. Like Flublok, Flucelvax was made possible because of a $1 billion, taxpayer-funded grant given by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the vaccine industry back in 2006 to develop new manufacturing methods for vaccines. The ultimate goal is to be able to quickly manufacture hundreds of millions of vaccines for rapid distribution. Meanwhile, there are reportedly two other GMO flu vaccines currently under development. One of them, which is being produced by Novavax, will utilize 'bits of genetic material grown in caterpillar cells called 'virus-like particles' that mimic a flu virus,' according to Reuters . "
0," It's been known since ancient times, especially in many Eastern medical and martial circles, that sexual energy is the most powerful energy in the body and can be used to achieve increased health, energy, strength, healing, longevity and enlightenment. The Chinese in particular have taken this knowledge to a very high level. The Taoists and Shaolin martial arts masters used this knowledge to greatly increase their martial power, strength, endurance and achieve longevity. Utilizing such disciplines and special herbal formulas, breathing and specific meditation techniques, they would lead the chi or life force, from the vessels in the legs where the main sexual energy is stored and guide it up the energy meridian in spine known as the thrusting vessel to the head to greatly increase the EMF or electro motive force in the brain. This significantly increased energy would also greatly stimulate the pineal and pituitary glands located deep within the center of the brain, increasing its functioning, strength and efficiency. The pineal gland The pineal gland contains three different kinds of crystals which are apatitie, calcite, and magnetite. Many believe that the pineal gland's abilities come from the natural production of DMT (Dimethyltryptamine, a psychedelic drug) when fully operational. This allows the individual to be in a constant visionary state the majority of the time. DMT is described as a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that is widespread throughout the plant kingdom. It occurs in trace amounts in humans, where it functions as an amine neurotransmitter. While the theory of energizing the brain is simple, the methods can take many years to master and are outside the scope of this article. However, by learning to use certain simple techniques such as semen retention during intercourse and regulated emissions of about once every two weeks, you can start storing more and more sexual energy which will benefit all of the organs and glands in the body. Dangers of excessive emissions It's important to understand that uncontrolled emission of seminal fluids via constant masturbation or excessive sex is one of the fastest ways for men to waste their yang energies. This not only exhausts your chi, but can cause adrenal fatigue which lowers immunity , making one more susceptible to colds, the flu, low energy, concentration problems and other health issues. For women, unregulated or unbalanced fluid loss during menstruation has a similar draining effect on the body. While this may not be especially deleterious when one is a teenager or in your early 20s, by the 30s and especially beyond, it becomes far more important to greatly limit or stop these uncontrolled emissions for pure pleasure. Learning to bring the woman to multiple orgasms while holding back seminal emissions will build up great amounts of sperm in the man, which also contains hormones, neurotransmitters, endorphins and immunosuppressants, enzymes, many nutrients and the all-important yang sexual energies. This alone should tell men just how important it is to stop abusing your sexual energies and fluids through excessive loss of these vital and critical life fluids. These techniques also benefit the woman by releasing her own yin sexual energies into the body, as well as exchanging yin and yang energies with her partner. While this can work with same sex partners, it is said to be much less effective - male/female is the most effective. Sexual energy is so important that Chinese martial artists are taught 'no sex for 100 days to build the foundation' when practicing special training exercises such as iron body, discipline techniques for great destructive power or advanced internal cultivation.

0," Pasteurized, homogenized, conventional milk is not getting any safer, thanks to a National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS) committee that last year voted against proposed new measures that would have reduced the maximum allowable pus cell count in conventional milk from 750,000 cells per millimeter (cells/mL) to 400,000 cells/mL. And some of those who voted against the proposal, which would have improved conventional milk quality and safety, are some of the same individuals that openly oppose raw milk sales because of supposed 'safety' concerns. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), a cooperative of American milk producers that represents dairy interests, reports that in a 26-25 decision, the voting delegates, a group composed of state regulators that oversee milk safety rules in their own states, voted to strike down the proposal. This decision, which obviously benefits filthy, large-scale milk production operations at the expense of public health, will result in the continued processing and sale of pus-filled milk, which is the tangible result of infections and diseases that commonly afflict conventional milking cows. 'Since it's been nearly 20 years since the current standard was established, we believed it was time to make changes that improve the nation's milk supply,' said Jamie Jonker, Vice President of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs at NMPF, which supported lowering the somatic cell count limit. 'It's regrettable that this approach isn't the one taken by NCIMS.' The NCIMS 'Council II' was reportedly responsible for voting on this issue. And as you will notice, this council is filled with representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), public health and safety officials from numerous states, and even representatives from large-scale dairy producers. Based on this list, it is no wonder that the majority voted against rules to improve the quality and safety of conventional milk, as such mandates would require cleaning up a toxic industry that basically thrives on existing poor safety standards. You can view a list of the Council II members here: http://www.ncims.org/Councils%20and%20Committees.htm Meanwhile, those who voted against conventional milk improvement requirements are some of the same folks that claim raw milk, regardless of how it is produced and no matter how much safety testing is involved, is inherently dangerous and unsafe for the public. The unscientific, double-standard very clearly illustrates everything that is wrong with the modern, toxic food system and the so-called public health agencies that allow it to thrive.

0," Just days after declaring a ban on two influenza vaccines manufactured by Swiss drug maker Novartis due to abnormal floating particles, the nations of Canada and Switzerland have officially lifted these bans at the request of the drug giant. According to Reuters , Novartis procured company-funded testing allegedly showing that the vaccines were still safe despite the abnormalities, which the two countries accepted as solid enough evidence to once again begin administering the questionable jabs. Several weeks ago, a handful of European Union nations and Canada noticed that some lots of Novartis' Agrippal and Fluad influenza vaccines contained unusually large white clumps floating in the injection solution, prompting health authorities to issue an immediate moratorium. Not only is vaccine solution in general supposed to be evenly disbursed without any clumps or particles, but it was also unclear precisely what the clumps actually were in the flu solutions. So to prevent a potential public health emergency, health officials decided to simply ban the vaccines altogether. Once Novartis got wind of this decision, though, the company scrambled to manufacture 'evidence' that the particles, which were later identified as atypically large proteins, were not a threat to human health. Even though these particles would presumably be injected into human muscle tissue along with the vaccine solution, Novartis declared the anomaly to not be a threat -- just go ahead and get your flu shot and do not worry about it, the company basically decreed. 'According to the scientific data presented to us, the safety of the vaccines is not compromised by the stray aggregates,' claimed the Swiss health agency Swissmedic in a recent announcement. The agency did not; however, provide any details as to the contents or conclusion of this supposed data. Italy, on the other hand, which went a step further by banning two other Novartis flu vaccines, Influpozzi and adjuvanted Influpozzi, is not so sure about Novartis' 'scientific data.' The country is reportedly in the process of reviewing the company's test results, while it remains 'cautiously positive' about potentially lifting its ban on the four vaccines. There is currently no word on how Germany, Spain, Austria, and France will respond to Novartis' claims that its flu vaccines are safe. Just a few days before Novartis' Chief Executive Officer Joseph Jimenez declared the company's flu vaccines to be safe, Novartis' third-quarter sales numbers were publicly released. According to Reuters , these numbers missed the forecast mark substantially, which presumably helped motivate Novartis to create the 'scientific data' it needed to declare its flu vaccines safe, and thus preserve their place in the market.

0," With all the emphasis on the importance of vitamins D and C, an important family of vitamins known as B-complex gets overlooked. The B vitamins are best known for their energizing abilities, their contributions to creating red blood cells, and their ability to boost nerve health and mental focus. They are mostly water based vitamins, which means they are not stored as well as fat based vitamins such as vitamin D3, so they need to be replaced more often. Some B power examples for boosting energy and reducing depression A nutritional psychology study, published in the June 2013 European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , surveyed 422 Tokyo municipal workers in a short cross sectional study, then performed a longitudinal study for three years on 210 subjects without depression symptoms and whose B6 pyridoxal serum levels were high. The researchers confirmed that high vitamin B6 serum levels have a strong association with reducing depression risks in adults. Another study, this one by Tufts University in Boston, determined that depression among Hispanics in the area was at least partly caused by chronic inflammation due to vitamin B6 deficiencies. This deficiency inhibits the cysteine needed to create the master antioxidant glutathiane ( http://www.selfnews.com ). A UK doctor had miraculous results using vitamin B12 injections on patients suffering from depression, chronic fatigue and various neurological ailments including neuropothy and insomnia. Because those patients already had what the medical establishment considered normal serum B12 levels, that doctor was investigated. The British medical authorities insisted he stop, despite hundreds of successes, until his therapy could be tested. So it goes with the medical mafia racket ( http://www.selfnews.com ). Benfotiamine is a lipid form of the normally water based thiamine (B1). Benfotiamine thiamine with added pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6) has been used successfully to nullify diabetes induced peripheral neuropathy ( http://www.selfnews.com ). The B vitamins, what they do, and how to make sure you have enough Elevated amounts of specific B vitamins are used to address specific conditions, such as niacin for mental disorders, folate for red blood cell production and pregnancy support, and those mentioned earlier in this article. But the rest of the B complex family should be involved at maintenance doses as a supportive foundation. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) Vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide) Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxine hydrochloride) Vitamin B7 (biotin) Vitamin B9 - (folate should be used instead of synthetic folic acid) Vitamin B12 - (methylcobalamin is the best) Cruciferous vegetables have high B complex contents. Other foods high in B vitamins include bee pollen, brewers yeast, bell peppers, mushrooms, summer squash, turnip greens, and other greens. Whole grain cereals, beans, and nuts are rich in thiamine and other B vitamins. Tuna, cod, chicken and turkey are considered good food sources for B vitamins as long as they are healthy or organic sources. Organic red meats from humanely treated, grass-fed cattle are excellent sources of vitamin B12. Many vegetarians are lacking sufficient B12 for brain and nervous system energy and red blood cell production. If you're not eating a good deal of red meat, you may need to supplement B12. But there's a problem with that. Oral B12 supplements have difficulty getting through the gastrointestinal tract intact, preventing it from getting into the bloodstream. That's why doctors give B12 injections or prescribe patients with the wherewithal to do it themselves. But most of us can rely on transdermal B12 patches, oral sprays or sublingual tablets that dissolve under the tongue and are absorbed directly into surface capillaries of the mouth. Just make sure methylcobalamin is the type of cobalamin B12 used. Others can be counterproductive or perhaps toxic. "
0," Weight Watchers, Fit Female Club, Jenny Craig...etc. whichever weight loss program you choose it seems they all add up to weight loss via their low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Recent research has determined that there is little difference among the weight loss programs used (which were unnamed in the study). The important thing was getting people to adhere to the diets and sticking with it; personalizing it to fit the dieter's needs. As is always the case with weight loss, the most important thing the study found was that the diet must be easy for the individuals to stick to and it must be sustainable for an extended period of time. The Study The research, which was published in JAMA, did a meta-analysis on over 50 long term trials (of at least 12 months) which encompassed over 7,300 people. The analysis found (of course) that dieters witnessed significantly more weight loss than non-dieters. After 6 months the low-carb dieters lost a median weight of 19.2 pounds, while the low-fat dieters lost 17.6 pounds, with both having similar results after 12 months (losing around 16 more pounds each). The great part about the study is that it depicts that one size doesn't fit everyone and that you should get on a plan that is tailored to fit your individual needs so you can more easily adhere to it. One member of the research team, Dr. Bradley C. Johnston of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute said, 'Our findings suggest that patients may choose, among those associated with the largest weight loss, the diet that gives them the least challenges with adherence.' Dieting Evolution This highlights that your diet doesn't have to be incredibly restrictive as this usually leads to dropout. In fact, severely restrictive dieting can have several adverse health effects like muscle loss, nutrition deficiency, episodes of over-eating and even weight gain. In order to teach yourself how to eat healthier it was recently determined that a good way to do this is to keep the things you love in your diet . You can do this by decreasing their portion size while increasing the portion size of healthy foods (vegetables, fruits, quality protein), enabling you to teach your brain (and you) how to eat healthier. It basically helps quench your urges/cravings for the things you love by still letting you have small portions. Wrap-Up It seems that as long as you eat a balanced diet, no matter if you choose a low carb or low fat diet, you can still achieve substantial results as long as you can adhere to it! As Dr. Linda Van Horn, R.D., at Northwestern University said, 'Choosing the best diet suited to an individual's food preferences may help foster adherence, but beyond weight loss, diet quality including micronutrient composition may further benefit longevity.' "
0," Magnesium is an essential micronutrient found in a wide variety of foods yet the US Department of Agriculture estimates that only about half of the population gets enough of it in their diets. How essential is it? Magnesium is found in every single cell in the body, with the highest concentrations in the bones and teeth, followed by the brain, heart and blood. It is involved in 300 separate metabolic functions. Because relatively little of the body's magnesium circulates in the blood, however, it can be hard to test magnesium levels directly. Instead, people and their doctors need to be on the alert for the early warning signs of deficiency. Symptoms to watch for What exactly does magnesium do in the body? In a nutshell: a little of everything. It is required for the production of energy by the body, along with DNA, RNA, protein and fat. It helps maintain blood vessels dilated at appropriate levels for heart health, and helps maintain oral and immune health. Magnesium also plays a key role in maintaining the electrolyte balance of cells, which means it critically affects nerve signals, muscle contractions and heartbeat. In its early phases, magnesium deficiency leads to digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. It also causes weakness and fatigue. Early magnesium deficiency has also been linked with sleep disturbances, including insomnia, and mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression. If the problem is not addressed in its early phases, deficiency will likely worsen. Ongoing, low-grade deficiency may lead to chronic health problems including osteoporosis, heart disease and diabetes. Low levels of magnesium in the brain have been linked to the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. More severe deficiency produces numbness and tingling, along with muscle dysfunction including twitches, cramps, seizures, abnormal heart rhythm and spasms, and even difficulty breathing. It can also produce personality changes. The groups at highest risk of magnesium deficiency are the elderly, diabetics, people who take diuretics and women who use hormonal birth control. Preventing or correcting deficiency How can you protect yourself from magnesium deficiency, or start correcting it if you worry your levels may be too low? If your deficiency is not severe, the best place to start is always by improving your diet. Magnesium is found in a wide variety of foods including beans, whole grains, leafy green vegetables, avocados, and seeds and nuts. Unfortunately, these foods are typically not consumed enough in the Western diet. Magnesium is also found in dark chocolate. For context, just 1 ounce of dry, roasted almonds or cashews or a half cup of spinach contains 20 percent of your daily magnesium requirement. You can get 15 percent of your daily magnesium from 1 cup of soy milk or a half cup of black beans. One cup of avocado, a 3.5 ounce baked potato (with skin), a half cup of brown rice, 1 cup of low-fat yogurt, and a single serving of fortified breakfast cereal all provide 10 percent of your daily magnesium needs. Magnesium is best absorbed by the body when it is consumed along with calcium and vitamin B6. You should aim to consume between 500 and 1,000 mg of magnesium daily. If you do choose to take a magnesium supplement, look for one that also includes these nutrients . You can also boost your body's effective use of magnesium by taking a supplement that also includes the magnesium co-factors glycinate, malate, orotate and taurinate. These increase your body's absorption of magnesium, while optimizing magnesium's effects on your heart, muscles, mood and general bodily systems. Magnesium glycinate is the form most effective at helping to correct long-term deficiency. "
0," Officials with Riverside County, Calif., removed a newborn baby from her mother without a valid reason or a court-ordered warrant, a practice that the county does very often, according to claims made by the mother in a federal class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff in the suit, known as 'A.A.,' which is the baby, filed suit against the county, Juvenile Dependency Investigator Karla Torres, Torres' supervisor Felicia M. Butler, and 'all similarly situated county social workers and investigators' Dec. 12, Courthouse News Service reported. The plaintiff's attorney, Shawn McMillan, told the news service that his firm, which focuses on civil rights cases against government child protective agencies, 'uncovered an alarming trend' about one year ago while undergoing discovery for other cases. 'County child welfare agencies regularly subvert the constitutional rights of parents and children by seizing children from their parents when there is no danger to the child, and in fact no need to seize the child at all,' McMillan told Courthouse News Service . 'The class action is designed to address a procedural problem. They [Riverside County social workers] as a matter of course don't get warrants before seizing kids,' he continued. 'Deficient policies, deficient training and deficient supervision all lead to civil rights violations on a regular basis. This lawsuit is designed to address the problem.' Child was healthy and in no danger The 27-page suit claims that A.A. is just one of thousands of children who were wrongfully taken away from their parents by the county's social workers. 'In February 2013, when she was three days old, plaintiff A.A. was snatched by an employee of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services literally from the breast of her mother as they lay in the hospital recuperating from a successful, safe delivery,' the complaint said. The child 'was healthy and in no danger whatever; her mother has no history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco use nor any history of psychiatric treatment,' the suit says. Further, the county 'had unlawfully seized (A.A.'s) four siblings months before and sent them into foster care,' the suit continues. It also claims that 'thousands of other children' have been taken by Riverside County's child agencies 'without any sort of warrant and without any risk of serious injury.' The suit notes that Tonita Rogers gave birth to A.A. via Caesarean section and then spent a few days recovering and bonding with her newborn. Rogers, in the suit, claims she was in good health and 'fully capable of taking care' of the child. In fact, three days later, Torres came to her hospital room and was able to see that she was recovering very well and that her newborn was healthy, the complaint states. 'Despite these facts, and solely because there had been an earlier dependency petition filed regarding plaintiffs' siblings, Torres seized the newborn baby plaintiff from her mother's care and custody,' says the complaint. They ought to know better Rogers says that Torres 'did not bother to seek a warrant,' which the complaint states would have likely taken about two hours. Torres also did not seek an ex parte petition for non-custodial removal before taking A.A., it says. McMillan told the news service that A.A. was returned to Rogers five to ten days later. He added that a number of seized children are taken out of their mothers' care for a year or more. He noted that half of his firm's cases involve African American children like A.A., and 'a large portion' are from poorer families. But he noted that white and upper-class parents were still not 'immune' from the problem, and that some of his firm's cases involved 'medical doctors and investment bankers.' Plaintiffs maintain that county social workers ought to know better than taking children without a warrant, as such behavior is illegal and in violation of basic civil rights protections. Further, the complaint says the county 'turned a blind eye' to what its social workers were doing.

0," A recent investigative report by NBC Dateline producer Andrea Canning has revealed some shocking new details about the pervasive nature of chemicals in both everyday consumer products and the general food supply. As relayed by ElephantJournal.com , using conventional cleaning and sanitary products and eating standard food items significantly increases levels of bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalates, and triclosan, not to mention hundreds or even thousands of other chemical additives, inside the body. As little as five years ago, most Americans were likely unaware of the existence of BPA, phthalates, or triclosan, let alone have any understanding of their pervasive use, even though these three chemicals are widely used in hand soaps, canned foods, cash register receipts, plastic containers, and many other products we are exposed to on a daily basis. But awareness is growing, especially as elevated levels of these 'deadly three' have been detected in at least 90 percent of the population. This fact came as a surprise to Canning, who decided to test her own urine, as well as the urine of her daughters, as part of a segment on chemical exposure and persistence. Canning began her investigation by taking baseline urine samples that reflected her everyday eating and living habits. She then cut out all the things that admittedly or may potentially contain the 'deadly three,' and took new samples. Following this, Canning went back to her original lifestyle and took another set of samples. Upon analysis, it was determined that, from the start, Canning and her family had high levels of BPA , phthalates, and triclosan in their bodies. According to ElephantJournal.com , Canning's six-month-old baby had levels of triclosan 10 times higher than the national average, while her toddler had triclosan levels 100 times higher. Canning also observed that when she went off the chemical-containing products, her levels of all three chemicals dropped dramatically, only to return to high levels once she began using her former chemical-containing products. 'We see where bisphenol over and over again in mouse and rats causes anxiety, and what I'm talking about are things like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder),' says Dr. Emilie Rissman, a widely-published professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia . Research conducted by Dr. Rissman and others has linked hormone disruptors like BPA to causing a range of health problems such as childhood obesity, autism, and infertility. 'I'm just reporting the data,' she adds. 'It's in peer-reviewed journals, I can replicate it, and those are the criteria for scientists.' Food cans, thermal receipts, antibacterial soaps among the worst chemical culprits When Canning stuck to a diet of microwaved, canned foods, diet sodas, and other processed, chemical-laden items, as well as continued to use her typical cosmetic and cleaning products, her chemical levels skyrocketed. But when she cut these products out and instead ate only fresh, organic foods, and avoided her normal makeup and cleansing products, Canning tested very low for chemicals , illustrating the importance of avoiding major sources of chemical exposure whenever possible. And just what are these major sources? Thermal receipt paper, canned food items, plastic containers and bags, and even paper money are among the most common sources of BPA, while phthalates can be found in plastic bags, cosmetics, lotions, and car interiors. Triclosan, which is still not properly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after more than 25 years, is commonly found in antibacterial soaps and cleaning products.

0," The fight is not over to get 'Frankenfood' labeled, as roughly 350,000 signatures have been successfully delivered to the Secretary of State's office in Washington state petitioning for a ballot measure that would require the labeling of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). According to The Spokesman-Review , the legislature in the Evergreen State will have the first pass at enacting the bill. And if the legislature rejects it, voters will then have the opportunity to pass the bill themselves with majority support, which would make Washington the first state in the union to recognize the divine right of human beings to know what is contained in the foods we eat. The bill is known as I-522, or 'The People's Right To Know Genetically Engineered Food Act,' and it very closely resembles Proposition 37 in California, which failed to pass with voter majority by a very slim margin. Like Prop. 37, I-522 is fairly simple and straightforward: if a food product contains ingredients that were derived using genetic modification, or if a food product itself was produced using genetic modification, then it must be clearly labeled at the retail level for the benefit of consumers. 'Beginning July 1, 2015, any food offered for retail sale in Washington is misbranded if it is, or may have been, entirely or partly produced with genetic engineering and that fact is not disclosed,' explains I-522. It goes on to explain which food products are included in this requirement -- raw agricultural commodities, processed foods, and seeds. You can read the complete text of I-522 for yourself here: http://www.labelitwa.org/read_i_522 Like in California with Prop. 37, the goal of I-522 in Washington is to increase transparency by requiring that food producers fully disclose the contents of their products to consumers. The bill does not make any declarations one way or the other about the safety of GMOs (though recent studies speak for themselves on this matter), but rather addresses the complete lack of honesty and full disclosure as it concerns hidden GMOs throughout the food supply. 'They're not being warned, they're being informed,' explained local resident Chris McManus to The Spokesman-Review about the bill's intent for consumers. 'A little bit more information never hurt anybody about the foods they eat.' This is the same sentiment shared by many Washingtonians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been more than eager to support efforts to get I-522 on the ballot in 2013. Though the I-522 campaign only needed 241,153 valid signatures by January 4, 2013, to have the bill considered for passage, the campaign was able to successfully gather more than 100,000 additional signatures beyond this requirement by the January 4 deadline. I-522 to protect Washington's agricultural economy, export market As can be expected, the misinformation brigade is already coming out in full force to fight against I-522, claiming many of the same lies responsible for deterring some California voters from supporting Prop. 37. But the I-522 campaign is already actively dispelling these myths, which include claims that GMO labeling will increase grocery costs and hurt the local economy. To the contrary, GMO labeling will help significantly boost Washington's agricultural economy, as well as preserve its valuable export market. 'Numerous foreign markets with restrictions against foods produced through genetic engineering have restricted imports of United States crops due to concerns about genetic engineering,' explains Section 1.8 of I-522. 'Mandatory identification of foods produced with genetic engineering can be a critical method for preserving the economic value of exports to markets with restrictions and prohibitions against genetic engineering.' This is a particularly important for Washington, as agriculture is its largest industry. Washington state is a huge exporter of wheat and many other agricultural commodities, which means GMO labeling would actually help farmers in the state by satisfying stricter export requirements mandated by countries like Japan, South Korea, China, and most European Union states, all of which currently require some form of GMO labeling. And contrary to false claims made in California that GMO labeling would 'hurt farmers,' strong support from farming communities throughout Washington state for I-522's passage show that GMO labeling will actually benefit farmers, otherwise they would not be in support of the bill. Many of these farmers are already wary about losing their export markets due to GMO contamination of their crops, which is why there is strong momentum in many agricultural regions of the state to pass I-522 and make a clear distinction between GMO and non-GMO crops. 'Preserving the identity, quality, and reliability of Washington's agricultural products is of prime importance to our state's fiscal health,' adds Section 1.12 of I-522. Be sure to read the full text of I-522, and encourage your friends and family in Washington state to call their representatives and urge support for truth in food labeling. "

0," Acupuncture outperformed both placebo and conventional pain therapies - including pharmaceutical drugs - in a new study conducted by researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York from numerous universities in Germany and England. The study was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine . The findings 'provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,' the authors wrote. Acupuncture is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine, a holistic healthcare system that focuses on both preventive and curative care. In traditional acupuncture, long, thin needles are inserted into specific bodily locations, known as meridians, in patterns indicated by the patient's specific symptoms and needs. Traditionally, acupuncture is combined with other therapies such as dietary changes, medicinal herbs and energetics practices such as Quigong. The use of acupuncture has become more popular in the West as scientific studies have continued to affirm its helpfulness, particularly for the relief of pain. It has been used as a treatment by the U.S. military and is even covered by some private insurance plans, although not by Medicare. The California Legislature recently recommended acupuncture as one of the therapies to be covered by all health insurance plans in the state, beginning in 2014. Studies have also shown acupuncture to be helpful in treating conditions other than pain, such as easing addiction-related cravings and even causing improvement in patients suffering from psychological or mood disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. But scientists remain divided over whether acupuncture provides any more benefit than a placebo, which was one of the questions the current study was designed to examine. Better than drugs, and safer The researchers conducted a meta-analysis on data from 29 prior studies involving nearly 18,000 adults. The research was funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , a federal institution, as well as the nonprofit Samueli Institute , which supports research into alternative medicine. The original studies had examined patients with chronic pain from a variety of causes, including neck, shoulder and back pain , arthritis, and recurring headaches. Participants in every study had been randomly assigned to treatment either from acupuncture, standard treatments such as drugs and physical therapy, or fake acupuncture that inserted needles at points other than the traditional meridians. In the meta-analysis, participants' pain was described using a scale from zero to 100. Prior to any intervention, the average participant's pain measured 60. The average pain after conventional Western treatment was 43, compared with 35 among patients who received fake acupuncture and 30 among those who received real acupuncture. The researchers noted that the difference between acupuncture and conventional treatments was strong and significant, while the difference between real and fake acupuncture was strong enough to be suggestive, but not conclusive. In a commentary published in the same issue of the journal, researcher and physician Andrew Avins of the University of California-San Francisco noted that the study was stronger than previous meta-analyses, because the authors examined the original data from the pooled studies and not just their conclusions. Avins was not involved in the study. Avins noted that the question of whether acupuncture works via placebo or via some other, unknown mechanism may be missing the point. Because acupuncture is an effective, low-risk therapy, the best course may be to offer it to patients now and worry about why it works later. 'Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,' he wrote. A typical acupuncture session costs between $60 and $100. "
0," A group of scientists working in the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health division has revolted against the corrupt managers of its own department, accusing them of committing crimes by claiming, 'There is extensive documentary evidence that managers at CDRH have corrupted and interfered with the scientific review of medical devices.' Read the letter yourself here (PDF): http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/11... The letter from the FDA's own scientists goes on to say, 'It is evident that managers at CDRH have deviated from FDA's mission to identify and address underlying problems with medical devices before they cause irreparable harm, and this deviation has placed the American people at risk.' Congressman John, Dingell, chair of the committee which received the letter, went on to charge that these FDA bureaucrats 'approved or cleared medical device applications in gross violation of laws and regulations...' ( http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/11... ) None of this, of course, surprises readers of selfnews. Note, too, that the mainstream media has virtually ignored this story? You might think that a revolt of FDA scientists against their criminal bosses would be a huge story worthy of front-page treatment at USA Today or the Washington Post, right? Only the NY Times bothered to report this story, as far as I can tell. ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/health/pol... ) The FDA: A gang of unindicted criminals The FDA, you see, is a criminal organization engaged in tactics of intimidation, censorship and oppression that can only be properly called 'terrorism.' Don't take my word for it, though: The FDA's own top scientists are now on the record saying much the same thing! Their complaint to Congress alleges top FDA managers 'ordered, intimidated and coerced FDA experts to modify their scientific reviews, conclusions and recommendations in violation of the law. Keep in mind this is from the FDA's own scientists! This isn't some outsider (like me) ranting about the FDA being a criminal organization; these are the words of the very people who work there! Even the FDA director is like an evil character out of a Marvel comic. His name is actually Dr. von Doom... er, I mean Dr. von Eschenbach, and he has routinely ignored the multiple letters sent to him by these scientists complaining of the same criminal behavior taking place at the agency. The FDA, of course, believes it is above the law and subject to no rules whatsoever. It is a political organization, and a criminal one at that. It will likely threaten these scientists just as it once threatened Dr. David Graham, and it will use every intimidation tactic at its disposal to discredit any employee who dares challenge the power and authority of the FDA. I wouldn't be surprised one day to find one of these intimidated scientists showing up at work and going Columbine on a few of the top FDA officials who are the masterminds behind these crimes against humanity. If that happens, perhaps the saying, 'Going Postal' will be updated as, 'Going FDA.' Because if there's anyone with a justified reason to be violently angry at their bosses, it's gotta be this group of intimidated scientists who are trying to save people's lives by making FDA approvals based on solid science. Instead, they're being routinely overruled by politics and Big Pharma deception, which they know will result in the loss of human life as consumers are harmed or killed by dangerous medical devices and pharmaceuticals. How would you like to work at a company with a crime boss, knowing your boss is a white-collar criminal whose decisions are going to get people killed? That's the reality these FDA scientists live with every day! And they're tired of it. They're beginning to revolt... Violence will not solve this problem Here's a question to you: When the FDA collapses, should the top managers be tried for their crimes, or simply hanged by their necks in the streets? Since I believe in non-violent solutions to such problems, I believe we should actually grant them all amnesty in exchange for their candid testimony before Congress, where they spill their guts about all the criminal acts they've engaged in over the years. Their testimony will be a lot more valuable to society than a bunch of bodies swinging from the rafters. What we need here, folks, is to learn the lessons from this rogue agency, not to take revenge on its people. Not everybody agrees with me on this. But I repeat to everyone listening: Do NOT engage in violent acts against the FDA, even if there is some social breakdown in the future that might give you such an opportunity. More than 90% of the people who work there are honest, hardworking individuals who are trying to fight the FDA's crimes from the inside. We need to let law and order sort out the criminals from the good guys, and then we'll work together to demand criminal sentencing for them, which I think should include ex-FDA bureaucrats going door to door selling Girl Scout Cookies to raise money to pay back the families of all the people killed by FDA-approved drugs. Remember: The medical violence that the FDA now directs towards the public should NOT be met with vengeful violence on the part of activists. It should be met with justice and wisdom for future generations. A little compassion can help us move past this dark era of FDA dominance and into a new golden age of true healing. But we cannot get to an era of healing if our own actions are motivated by violent acts. Violence is the tool of the weak. That's why the FDA uses the threat of violence to raid vitamin companies. Healing is the tool of the strong. If we hope to move beyond the treacherous philosophies the FDA is demonstrating today, we must transcend violence and rely on healing (at many levels) to move us past this dark era. The big question right now, of course, is: When will the FDA arrests begin? January 21st might be a good day to get that started...

(Full copy included below) Pharmalot article, the original source for this story: http://www.pharmalot.com/2008/11/congress-pr... Congressman John Dingell's statement: Dingell, Stupak to Investigate FDAs Medical Device Approval Process Lawmakers Question Whether FDA Knowingly Allowed Unsafe & Ineffective Medical Devices into U.S. Market Washington, D.C. - Reps. John D. Dingell (D-MI), Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Bart Stupak (D-MI), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, today launched an investigation into whether managers within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) knowingly corrupted the scientific review process and approved or cleared medical device applications in gross violation of laws and regulations designed to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Such activity could allow potentially unsafe and ineffective medical devices into the U.S. market. The investigation was prompted by receipt of an October 14, 2008, letter written on behalf of a large group of CDRH scientists and physicians who state that CDRH managers have corrupted and interfered with the scientific review of medical devices. These allegations are deeply concerning, and we intend to uncover whether any FDA activity has compromised the health and safety of America consumers, said Dingell. I commend the FDA scientists for courageously sounding the alarm on what appears to be a serious problem. I look forward to pursuing the steps necessary to ensure that the medical devices Americans depend on are safe and effective. Our investigations have found that the FDA has allowed contaminated food and unsafe drugs to enter the market, and now serious allegations have been raised about the scientific integrity of the FDA medical device approval process, Stupak said. Although the FDA has launched its own investigation into this matter, no corrective action has been taken. The committee intends to learn what action the FDA plans to take to ensure the integrity of the medical device approval process and prevent retaliation against the scientists who blew the whistle on these activities. This Committee has been provided with compelling evidence to support the charges that senior managers within CDRH ordered, intimidated and coerced FDA experts to modify their scientific reviews, conclusions and recommendations in violation of the law. The CDRH scientists also claim that CDRH managers ordered them to make safety and effectiveness determinations that are not in accordance with scientific regulatory requirements, to use unsound evaluation methods, and accept clinical and technical data that is not scientifically valid or obtained in accordance with legal requirements, such as obtaining proper informed consent from human subjects. Additionally, documentary evidence reviewed by this Committee indicates that CDRH scientists who raised concerns up their chain of command have experienced reprisals for their insistence on adherence to a scientific and regulatory basis for medical device review. To protect these CDRH scientists who have risked their careers to bring their concerns to the attention of this Committee, we will not disclose their identities at this time. Since January 2007, the Committee on Energy and Commerce and its Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations have been investigating the ability and commitment of the Food and Drug Administration to protect Americans from unsafe food, drugs, and medical devices. For more information about the Committees ongoing drug safety investigation visit: http://energycommerce.house.gov/Investigatio... During this Congressional session, Committee leaders released draft legislation aimed at improving the safety of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Work in this draft bill, the Food and Drug Administration Globalization Act,' continues. Committee leaders plan to introduce comprehensive legislation early next session. For more information visit: http://energycommerce.house.gov/FDAGlobalAct... In a letter sent today to FDA Commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach, Dingell and Stupak requested a briefing on what actions the Commissioner has taken to date and how the Commissioner intends to resolve all issues raised by the CDRH scientists and physicians.

0," The federal agencies regulating nuclear power are scrambling to find a solution to a potentially devastating threat: meltdown of nuclear reactors at such plants stemming from an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the U.S. power grid. As reported by the Washington Examiner there is good news and bad news surrounding the issue: The good news is that the issue and proposed fix are easy. The bad news is that there is growing concern that an EMP attack, either from a North Korean nuclear bomb or a solar storm, will occur first. In particular, federal nuclear regulatory officials are focusing on the cooling pools used to store spent fuel rods that are still very radioactive and could catch fire and explode, spewing radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and across North America. Federal agencies have said that an EMP attack could disable the nation's power grid for months. Most plants use diesel-powered generators for backup power to the water pumps in the cooling pools, and there is only about 17 days' worth of fuel stored at each site. Some members of former President Ronald Reagan's 'Star Wars' team who are now with the Foundation for Resilient Societies, a non-profit group examining the issue, saw the problem clearly following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Afterward, the group suggested switching from diesel generators to long-lasting solar power. 'Dangerous course ' 'That's when the alarm bells went off,' Thomas S. Popik, president of Resilient Societies said in an interview with the Washington Examiner . There were similar concerns raised after New England's Pilgrim nuclear facility was forced to shut down during a blizzard. In response, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is currently considering the group's proposed fix, which is rare considering that the agency does not often entertain outside proposals. 'It's a national issue,' said Brian Sullivan, a proponent of the fix and a retired Federal Aviation Administration investigator. 'The NRC needs to change its dangerous course.' According to its website, the Foundation for Resilient Societies 'is dedicated to cost-effective protection of technologically-advanced societies from infrequently occurring natural and man-made disasters. Our primary mission is scientific research and education.' 'Our current area of emphasis is protection of the U.S. electric grid through the federal rulemaking process at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and its designated standard-setting organization, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation,' the site continues. 'We also have a pending Petition for Rulemaking at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for protection of nuclear power plants during long-term loss of offsite commercial grid power.' As for the concerns surrounding a man-made or natural EMP burst, they are very real. In April 2014, we reported that several experts around the world say civilians are not ready for widespread, prolonged blackouts that such events would cause. Widespread devastation In May, we reported that an EMP event that knocked out the U.S. power grid could kill up to 90 percent of the population, according to experts who testified on Capitol Hill. 'It strikes at my very core when I think of the men, women, and children in cities and rural towns across America with a possibility of no access to food, water, or transportation,' Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., told The Washington Free Beacon . 'In a matter of weeks or months at most, a worst-case scenario could bring devastation beyond imagination. 'The civilian grid, in my judgment, is very vulnerable,' he continued. 'Some of the largest transformers, the very largest ones, have an inherent resistance to all but the more intense electromagnetic pulses. But the fact is, we have enough of those mid-range transformers where a major event would be catastrophic.' In October, we reported that the billionaire CEO and founder of Elliott Management hedge fund, Paul Singer , issued a warning to subscribers of his financial newsletter that an EMP event would spell disaster.

0," McDonald's, the largest fast food chain in the world, is creating a benevolent image and deflecting criticism of their toxic junk food and low wages by associating its mascot, Ronald McDonald, with Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC), an international housing charity. RMHC offers a network of temporary lodging for parents of hospitalized children who live far enough away from the hospitals that they need help staying near their children while hospitalized. The recommended contribution for staying is usually $15 a day, but if that can't be afforded, parents are still allowed to stay. It must be said cynically, that this is all mostly a distraction from real health all the way around. Children are being given toxic treatments for cancer and fed GMO and processed hospital foods while their parents are given low cost or free lodging to hang around and comfort them, all under the rubric of Ronald McDonald, junk food McDonald's visible mascot and symbol. Of course, if a child is hospitalized necessarily for serious injury trauma, such a charity is helpful. There aren't many natural solutions for broken or burnt body parts. But the hypocrisy goes deeper with the association of RMHC and McDonald's fast food restaurants. McDonald's contributions range from miniscule to none McDonald's gets a lot of free brand name promotion out of this. Appearances from Ronald McDonald clowns on local TV stations promoting RMHC adds to the free promotion. And while covering its negative contribution of unhealthy food and diverting attention from its poorly paid, overworked staffs, they're softening parents and luring kids. After all, who would argue with a benevolent charity ? 'Clowning Around With Charity,' a detailed report by Michele Simon, with cooperation from various NGO corporate monitoring groups, clearly shows that what McDonald's 'gives back' is a tiny fraction of their revenue, and much of it comes from restaurant customer contribution boxes. But McDonald's acts like it's all from them. Image is everything! Even in New Mexico, my home state, the RMHC FAQ webpage mentions that no more than 10 percent of their total operating funds come from McDonald's stores. A lot of that is from customer donations. Other houses in Dallas and Los Angeles report even lower percentages from McDonald's. McDonald's does offer a small portion of its vast multi-billion dollar revenue philanthropically. Check out these comparisons from the aforementioned report's graphics: Folks whose earnings exceed $50K annually donate an average of 4.7% of their discretionary income to charities; leading corporations donate 1.01% of their pre-tax profits; McDonald's pre-tax profit shares to charity comes in at 0.32%. All the while, McDonald's revels in the spotlight as the most magnanimous corporation of them all, especially with the RMHC group stationing its millions of lodging beds throughout the world. Ronald McDonald's name and image are attached to some other charitable functions as well. RMHC also offers mobile care centers, vehicles fitted with expensive medical equipment, which are externally adorned with large images of McDonald's cheerful clown . RMHC also offers grants and college scholarships. Again, it looks like its all coming from McDonald's. But each page promoting those services has its own large donate button on it. Then there are those 'McTeacher's Nights' that add funds to local schools. School teachers volunteer their services for a night to replace the store's underpaid staffers. This encourages parents to come in with their kids and chow down. The normal take for these nights amounts to around a dollar per student. McDonald's makes it out with more kids as future customers and a rosier image. Compared to what McDonald's pays for advertising and lobbying to oppose legislative restrictions on advertising junk food to children, they're getting a free promotional ride through 'charitable' activities.

0," Vitamin D is best known for its anti-cancer effects, but suddenly, following a flurry of recent research, it's becoming increasingly recognized for its ability to prevent diseases like diabetes and depression. Now heart disease is also emerging as a chronic health condition that vitamin D can help prevent. Here, we've assembled a collection of relevant research quotations on vitamin D and heart disease from authors like Phyllis Balch, Dr. James Dowd, Dr. Joel Fuhrman and many more. Enjoy this unique collection! Vitamin D in the prevention of heart disease Diabetes, both type-1 and type-2, are profoundly linked to low vitamin D levels. Obesity, heart disease, hypertension and stroke are inversely related to sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels. Psoriasis, eczema, and periodontal disease are lessened by sunlight exposure and high serum vitamin D. Fertility is positively influenced by sunlight exposure and high vitamin D levels. Sunlight enhances immune system function by producing vitamin D. Dozens of disorders other than those mentioned in this summary are related to vitamin D deficiency. - Solar Power For Optimal Health by Marc Sorenson Vitamin D supplements are likely to be useful in preventing diabetes in areas where vitamin D deficiency is common. In a 1997 study looking at the links between environmental factors and Type II diabetes, vitamin D levels were assessed in 142 Dutch men aged from 70 to 88 years of age. Thirty-nine per cent were found to have low vitamin D levels and tests showed that low vitamin D levels increased the risk of glucose intolerance. Heart disease: Low vitamin D levels may also increase the risk of atherosclerosis. - The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements and Herbs by Nicola Reavley Osteoporosis is closely correlated to heart disease. Vitamin D deficiency could certainly be a factor in both, because there is a strong inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and artery calcification; the more D in the blood, the less the calcification. Artery cells have vitamin D receptors (VDR), which when stimulated by vitamin D, inhibit the incursion of calcium. - Solar Power For Optimal Health by Marc Sorenson 'I think vitamin D is an important ingredient in the longevity recipe,' he said enthusiastically, as if just struck by an epiphany. 'Your skin manufactures vitamin D when it comes into contact with the sun. Without that vitamin D, we increase our risk for nearly all age-related diseases including many types of cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and even autoimmune diseases like MS (multiple sclerosis).' Insufficient vitamin D markedly accelerates heart disease in kidney patients. - The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest by Dan Buettner Based on the evidence from these studies, there is no reason to take vitamin D or calcium, ever. You can get all the vitamin D you need by taking a walk in the sunshine, especially in winter, since sunlight stimulates natural formation of vitamin D. However, if you want to take vitamin D there is no risk. - Before You Take that Pill: Why the Drug Industry May Be Bad for Your Health by J. Douglas Bremner To ensure adequate supplies of vitamin D, get at least twenty minutes of sun exposure on the face and hands each day. If that is not possible, take 400 to at most 1,000 milligrams of vitamin D supplements daily. Do not take more than 1,000 milligrams of vitamin D daily or take the supplement for more than six months; excessive use of vitamin D is associated with atherosclerosis and heart disease. Vitamin D is needed for calcium to enter bones, and a deficiency of this vitamin is a major risk factor for both osteoporosis and bone fracture. - Prescription for Herbal Healing: An Easy-to-Use A-Z Reference to Hundreds of Common Disorders and Their Herbal Remedies by Phyllis A. Balch, CNC In addition, people who receive adequate sunlight exposure do not need as much vitamin D in their diet as do people who receive minimal sunlight exposure. Vitamin D increases both calcium and phosphorus absorption. Vitamin D has also been reported to increase absorption of aluminum. Increased blood levels of calcium (which can be a marker for vitamin D status) have been linked to heart disease. Some, but not all research suggests that vitamin D may slightly raise blood levels of cholesterol in humans. - The Natural Pharmacy: Complete Home Reference to Natural Medicine by Schuyler W. Lininger, Jr. DC Low vitamin D levels may also increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Research suggests that a low level of vitamin D increases the risk of calcium build-up in atherosclerotic plaques, and that higher levels reduce the risk of build-up. Researchers at UCLA School of Medicine measured the vitamin D levels in the blood of 173 men and women at risk of heart disease and also measured the build-up of calcium in coronary arteries (a common finding in coronary artery disease). The results suggest that calcium may regulate calcium deposition in the arteries as well as in the bone. - The New Encyclopedia of Vitamins, Minerals, Supplements and Herbs by Nicola Reavley UVB light is available in Florida essentially year round for the production of vitamin D. This is significant today - even more than historically - because vitamin D and a healthy diet represent a real Fountain of Youth. The most prevalent health problems of old age are arthritis, osteoporosis, heart disease , cancer, and dementia, and all of these respond favorably to normalization of vitamin D levels and diet. The Vitamin D Cure goes beyond the mythical Fountain of Youth for seniors because it's a Fountain for Youth, too. - The Vitamin D Cure by James Dowd and Diane Stafford Vitamin D - reduces heart disease risk in women. It was reported at the 42nd annual conference on Cardiovascular Disease and Epidemiology Prevention that women who take vitamin D supplements lowered their risk of death from heart disease by one-third. The finding was an unexpected dividend extracted from an osteoporosis trial to determine the incidence of bone fracture in nearly 10,000 older women. From the trial participants, 4200 women reported taking vitamin D supplements at the onset of the study; another 733 reported a prior history of supplementation. - Disease Prevention and Treatment by The Life Extension Editorial Staff Without enough vitamin D, adults are prone to osteoporosis and children are prone to a disease called rickets that results in improper bone growth and deformity. Vitamin D deficiencies have also been shown to play a role in the development of dozens of diseases - everything from many different cancers to diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, psoriasis, and mental illness. Once the link between vitamin D and rickets was established early in the twentieth century, American milk was fortified with vitamin D, all but eliminating the disease in America. - Survival of the Sickest: A Medical Maverick Discovers Why We Need Disease by Dr. Sharon Moalem Another study assessed vitamin D levels in colorectal cancer patients and compared them to the risk of patient death over eleven years. Those with the highest levels of vitamin D had a 48% reduced risk of dying compared to those with the lowest levels. A similar scientific investigation showed that among those with heart disease, death from any cause over seven years was doubled among those whose vitamin D levels were lowest compared to those whose levels were highest. Another investigation showed that vitamin D reduces a major predictor of aging. - Solar Power For Optimal Health by Marc Sorenson Low calcium and vitamin D intake has been linked to stroke. Researchers compared the diets of thirty-five women who have had strokes accompanied by no history of high blood pressure or heart disease, with the diets of women who have never had strokes. Results indicate that the healthy women's diets contained 38 percent more vitamin D and 17 percent more calcium than those of the stroke victims. - Earl Mindell's Secret Remedies by Earl Mindell, R.Ph., Ph.D. It also is important to make sure vitamin D intake is adequate. Those not getting sufficient sunshine to meet their vitamin D needs should take a supplement. Vitamin D deficiency is epidemic in America, and it contributes not only to the development of osteoporosis but to increased cancer and heart disease as well. The diet and supplementation plan recommended in this book is designed to assure nutritional completeness and to help you achieve your maximal health potential. It is rich in calcium and iron from green vegetables, contains adequate protein, and is extremely nutrient dense. - Cholesterol Protection for Life, New Expanded Edition by Dr. Joel Fuhrman If you are over 50 years of age, a 400 IU of vitamin D is recommended daily, especially if it is not included in your daily supplement and you do not spend much time outdoors. If you are over 60 years of age, make sure your supplement contains 25 mcg of vitamin B12 - if not, consider taking a supplement. If you are 70 years of age or older, take 600 IU of vitamin D daily. CAUTION: If you currently have or are at risk for heart disease, or if you are a male, make sure that your multivitamin does not contain iron. - Active Wellness - A Personalized 10 Step Program for a Healthy Body, Mind & Spirit by Gayle Reichler, M.S., R.D., C.D.N. Because of the lack of sunlight, you don't have enough active vitamin D, so your body pumps up your cholesterol in the hope of converting as much as possible to active vitamin D. This serves as another example of an evolutionary trade-off between procreation and longevity. To protect us from deficiencies of vitamin D, we've evolved to have higher levels of cholesterol. So now we survive to mate and to be able to stand up strong and look good, only to be felled by high LDL cholesterol and consequent heart disease and stroke. - You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty by Mehmet C. Oz., M.D. and Michael F. Roizen, M.D. Poor vitamin D status has been linked to increased risk of breast, prostate and colon cancers, osteoporosis and other bone disorders, Type 1 diabetes, arthritis, infertility, PMS, chronic fatigue and depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, multiple sclerosis, musculoskeletal pain, and heart disease. Ironically, the few foods that contain vitamin D are mostly items that have fallen out of favor thanks to orthodoxy's fanatical anti-fat and cholesterol campaign, such as cod liver oil, butter, whole milk, liver and egg yolks. - The Great Cholesterol Con: Why Everything You've been Told About Cholesterol, Diet and Heart Disease is Wrong by Anthony Colpo In laboratory experiments the biologically active form of vitamin D has been shown to inhibit the growth of malignant melanoma and other cancer cells. Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in a number of cancers and other major diseases. The action of sunlight on the skin is the natural way of producing vitamin D. So it is entirely plausible that the number of people who die each year of cancer of the breast, colon and prostate together with those who die from coronary heart disease, stroke and broken hips could be reduced by the adoption of regular, moderate sunbathing. - The Healing Sun: Sunlight and Health in the 21st Century by Richard Hobday PhD Men who are deficient in vitamin D were found to have more than double the normal risk of suffering a heart attack or dying even after all other possible risk factors such as hypertension, obesity and high levels of blood fat were excluded. Populations in northern countries (with less intense sunlight and lower levels of vitamin D) have higher numbers of heart disease than sun-filled southern countries. In additon, more heart attacks occur in the winter months, when sunlight is scarce. - Cancer Is Not A Disease - It's A Survival Mechanism by Andreas Moritz "
0," Women who would like to significantly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer now have a natural and simple way to do so. Researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have conducted studies indicating that daily consumption of tea and citrus fruits can lower the risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer by nearly a third. The UK's Express reports on the findings: The research team studied the dietary habits of 171,940 women aged between 25 and 55 for more than three decades. The team found that those who consumed food and drinks high in flavonols - which are found in tea, red wine, apples and grapes - and flavanones - which are found in citrus fruit and juices - were less likely to develop the disease. [1] This is particularly good news, considering that ovarian cancer is the fifth biggest cancer threat to women -- at least in Britain -- and is sometimes referred to as the 'silent killer,' because its symptoms aren't noticeable until the disease has progressed significantly. More than half of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer die within five years. Flavones and flavonols are subclasses of dietary flavonoids, and since they are found so readily in any supermarket, they represent an inexpensive and easy way for women to protect themselves from this deadly form of cancer. Professor Aedin Cassidy, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: The main sources of these compounds include tea and citrus fruits and juices, which are readily incorporated into the diet, suggesting that simple changes in food intake could have an impact on reducing ovarian cancer risk. In particular, just a couple of cups of black tea every day was associated with a 31 per cent reduction in risk. Medical News Today also reported on the results of the new research: Results show that participants who had the highest intakes of flavonol and flavanone had a lower risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer than those who had the lowest intakes. [2] The results are not entirely conclusive, but the large sample size (171,940 women) and the long-term follow-up of the study make the findings very encouraging. Limitations of the study's findings include the fact that: ...the mean cumulative dietary flavonoid intakes were calculated from recent US Department of Agriculture (USDA) databases with input from other sources, but flavonoid contents can vary in foods, depending on growth and processing conditions. Additionally, while the team adjusted for possible confounders linked with ovarian cancer risk, they say there was still the possibility of 'residual confounding from unmeasured factors. ' However, after careful adjustment for these potential confounders, it is unlikely that they could have accounted for the results that the researchers observed. More conclusive studies need to be performed, but in the meanwhile women can begin to adjust their dietary routines to include daily consumption of the foods which contain these compounds. It certainly makes sense to do so, especially in light of the fact that most of these foods are already part of a healthy and nutritious diet. So, ladies, the next time you enjoy a nice cup of black tea or a glass of citrus juice, you can also feel good about the fact that you are very likely -- and significantly -- helping your body reduce the risk of developing one of the most dreaded forms of cancer.

0," A depressed immune system lowers the body's ability to fight off all sorts of diseases, from the simple common cold to cancer. A body with a weak immune system is more susceptible to infections and diseases; infections and diseases then cause further damage to the body and its immune system; this results in a vicious cycle which can cause a persons' health to degenerate. Here are some important dietary and lifestyle tips to help boost one's immunity and break out of this downward spiral. 1. Exercise Exercise benefits the mind and body in many ways and has been shown in many studies to lower one's risk of numerous diseases. Some research, for example, found that people who engaged in regular physical activity were less likely to get cancer than those who did not. Recommendations differ; Michael Murray, ND, recommends at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and 5-10 minutes of stretching every day. It is important to listen to one's body and practice common sense -- overexertion too quickly can cause more harm than good. Intense workouts also have the effect of short-term immune suppression. 2. Sleep Sufficient and good-quality rest has a tremendous impact on immunity. Some experts and research suggest at least 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep per day, with a person being in bed by 10pm or 11pm. 3. Sunlight Moderate, common-sense exposure to daily sunshine helps the body produce adequate levels of vitamin D, and this hormone plays a critical role in many aspects of human health, including immune function. 4. Water Consumption of an adequate amount of water -- preferably filtered and fluoride free -- every day is necessary for tip-top immune function. A common recommendation is at least eight glasses each day. 5. Manage stress Stress, both mental and emotional, damages the immune system and needs to be properly managed. Daily deep breathing and relaxation exercises help mitigate stress, as do nature walks and meditation. Some people engage in yoga to help deal with stress. Help should be sought if emotional issues cannot be resolved on one's own. 6. Healthy weight Obesity has been implicated as a factor which impairs the immune function. With obesity levels on the rise, this would thus be an increasingly significant contributor to weakened immunity. 7. Avoid refined sugars When it comes to what to avoid to protect one's immune system, refined sugar is among those at the top of the list. Research has suggested that it could impair immunity to quite a significant degree, reducing the function of white blood cells possibly by 50% over a period of up to five hours after ingestion. ( http://www.selfnews.com ) 8. Probiotics Consume yogurt or other foods which contain good bacteria, such as sauerkraut and kimchi, or take a probiotic supplement. A significant portion of immune function actually resides in the gut. Good bacteria also keep the growth of harmful and immunity-damaging microorganisms in check. 9. Avoid immune-damaging elements These include cigarettes, excessive alcohol, MSG, artificial food additives and preservatives, heavy metals, harmful chemicals in household and personal cleaning products, etc. These are known to harm health. Go for natural products as often as possible. 10. Good nutrition Consume plenty of natural whole foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, legumes, seeds and nuts. The body needs a well balanced dietary intake sufficiently stocked with essential nutrients. According to Dr. Murray, 'nutrient deficiency is the most frequent cause of a depressed immune system.' Many clinical and experimental studies suggest that deficiency in just one single nutrient can greatly impair immune-system function. Taking a broad-spectrum multi-supplement or green drinks and supplements such as chlorella, spirulina , barley grass, etc. would be useful in providing the various essential nutrients the body needs.

0," Something has been killing off prairie dogs living in and around Doney Park in Flagstaff, Arizona, and health officials have now confirmed it to be the plague. According to reports, fleas collected from burrows around Doney are testing positive for the disease, which ravaged Europe for some 150 years during the 14th century, earning the name 'the Black Death,' before eventually fizzling out. ABC 15 News in Phoenix reports that residents throughout the area have already been notified by the Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD), which conducted the testing, that the plague is present. Monitoring will continue, the district says, and the situation will be continually assessed to determine whether or not further action is needed to contain the disease. Authorities say this is the first time plague that activity has been reported in the area this year, and that the disease is known to be endemic to the area. Just how widespread it actually is, however, is largely unknown and may be vastly underestimated, revealed CCPHSD in a recent press release. Black Death wiped out 60 percent of Europe's population Any mention of the word plague is likely to drum up thoughts of mass death -- after all, some 60 percent of the population of Europe at the time was wiped out when the Black Death ran its course. Known officially as Yersinia pestis , the bacterium is known to have caused three major outbreaks: the Justinian Plague, the Great Plague and the Modern Plague, the latter of which, the most recent, spread throughout China, and partially into the U.S., during the 1860s. As harrowing as these events were, experts say the public shouldn't worry about fleas carrying the plague in Arizona. With the advent of modern antibiotics and improved hygiene, says Dave Wagner, associate director of the Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics at Northern Arizona University (NAU), modern society need not worry. 'People should be more concerned with putting on their seat belts and driving safely than acquiring a plague infection,' he told The Arizona Republic . Plague seems to emerge mostly in 'Four Corners' region of American west Wagner and his colleague Dr. Paul Keim have been studying the evolution of infectious diseases like the plague for years, trying to better understand how they spread, where they spread and why. The duo has determined that the plague particularly fancies the Western U.S. and seems to emerge in the 'Four Corners' area where Arizona , New Mexico, Utah and Colorado all meet. 'It's not very well understood,' added Wagner to the Republic . 'We think it has something to do with climate and the rodent community.' Humans have a very low risk of contracting the plague from these creatures, he says, and thus shouldn't worry too much. Sanitation has improved dramatically since the Middle Ages when the plague was a real threat, and humans today rarely come into direct contact with rats and other common carriers of the disease. Fleas can bite humans, though, and they especially like household pets like cats and dogs. For this reason, it is wise to be cautious when visiting areas like Doney Park, especially if you have animals with you. Officials are warning people not to camp in the area of Doney Park until further notice. 'The incubation period from the time the flea bites you to symptoms would be one to seven days,' stated Marlene Gaither from CCPHSD to FOX 10 News . 'The symptoms are sudden fever, like 104 or higher, body aches... really bad chills and so you would want to get to a doctor.'

0," Choosing better foods to eat is only half the battle when you're goal is to improve your overall wellness. The road to a better diet is also paved with better preparation methods, not just better foods. 'While most people know to ditch the fryer when cooking up healthy meals many don't think about how their cooking method affects the nutritional make-up of their entree,' write Lindsay Joe and Elizabeth Jarrard of Greatist.com , a fast-growing fitness, health and happiness start-up. For instance, they note, vegetables can lose up to 15-20 percent of some essential vitamins because of heat, including vitamin C, folate, and potassium. They add that some cooking methods are worse than others, which 'is why raw foodists cut out cooking altogether, claiming that uncooked food maintains all of its nutritional value and supports optimal health.' That said, some recent studies have noted that certain foods can benefit from cooking. Heat can help release antioxidants from tomatoes, spinach and carrots, just to name a few, by breaking down cell walls and providing easier passage of healthy components into the body. Let's examine a few of the healthiest cooking methods and what effectively makes them better choices: Editor's note: For a better explanation of why microwave ovens destroy your food, read this more recent article by Mike Adams, the editor of this site: http://www.selfnews.com/039404_microwave_... Steaming your fish and veggies is safe, healthy and efficient. The experts note that steaming food is an excellent way to prepare it while locking in freshness, nutrients and vitamins. 'Cooking anything from fresh veggies to fish fillets this way allows them to stew in their own juices and retain all their natural goodness,' Joe and Jarrard write. 'And no need for fat-laden additions to up the moisture.' They recommend adding a bit of seasoning first, such as a sprinkle of salt or even a squeeze (or cap-full) of lemon juice. 'To steam on top of the stove, simply bring water to a boil in your selected stove-top steamer, reduce heat so that a strong simmer sends steam escaping, add food to the steaming compartment, cover with a lid, and begin timing,' says Shape magazine. Poaching is another steaming technique you can use. Some experts think poaching decreases nutrient retention because it generally takes a bit longer, but it is an effective way to prepare delicate foods like eggs, fish or even some fruits. Broiling and grilling your way to goodness. Anytime you don't have to toss your food into boiling grease in order to prepare it, you are light years ahead of the game in terms of preparing healthy meals. Broiling involves cooking food under direct heat at high temperatures for a short period of time. Broiling is a really good way to prepare tender cuts of meat (though you should remember to trim excess fat before doing so). Broiling is not the best way to cook vegetables; however, because it can dry them out easily. Grilling is another way to retain maximum nutritional value in your foods without giving up flavor. 'It requires minimal added fats and imparts a smoky flavor while keeping meats and veggies juicy and tender,' say Joe and Jarrard. 'Grilling adds calorie-free smoky flavor to meats, vegetables and even fruits, and the high heat produces an unmatched crisp crust,' says FoodNetwork.com . Editor's note: Grilling is terrible for your health if it burns the food. Burned foods contain cancer-causing chemicals created during the burning process. Whip up some stir-fry. This cooking method does require use of a small amount of oil in the pan, what is required is very minimal; you should only need just enough to get a nice sear on your meat and veggies. Stir-fry techniques are best for bite-sized pieces of meat, some grains like quinoa and rice, and thin-sliced veggies such as julienned carrots, bell peppers and snow peas. 'Stir-frying is an incredibly versatile cooking method for any healthy eater because it works well with meats, tofu, and vegetables; it's fast, which means you can put together a dinner quickly; ' and 'it helps you add more healthful veggies to your meals,' says the healthy eating website SparkPeople.com .

0," The battle continues to rage between the individual states and the federal government over the legalized cultivation and use of medical marijuana. Americans for Safe Access (ASA), the nation's largest medical marijuana advocacy organization, has now filed a lawsuit against the Obama Administration's Justice Department for aggressively trying to subvert state and local laws by shutting down legal medical marijuana dispensaries. California, Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, and a handful of other US states all have laws on the books that permit the growth, possession, and use of medical marijuana in some way, shape, or form. But the federal government still ignorantly classifies the natural plant as a Schedule I narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, a tenet of the 'War on Drugs' that has been a source of much conflict over the past several years. This ongoing clash between state and federal law has led to numerous federal raids of medical marijuana growers and distributors, particularly in the State of California where medical marijuana laws are among the most lenient, and where the plant is most utilized. The federal government also routinely intimidates local officials to try to get them to ban medical marijuana dispensaries. In a most recent raid, for instance, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) stormed Northstone Organics, a fully-licensed marijuana cultivation collective in Mendocino County, Cal. Agents reportedly cut down all 99 of the group's marijuana plants, and handcuffed the owner and his wife with zip-ties. With a lawsuit, ASA hopes to finally put an end to this type of federal government oppression of medical marijuana both in California, and in the other states that have legalized the plant. 'Although the Obama Administration is entitled to enforce federal marijuana laws, the Tenth Amendment forbids it from using coercive tactics to commandeer the law-making functions of the State,' said ASA Chief Counsel Joe Elford, who filed the lawsuit in San Francisco's Federal District Court. 'This case is aimed at restoring California's sovereign and constitutional right to establish its own public health laws based on this country's federalist principles.' For the first time ever, a recent Gallup poll shows that most Americans now support legalizing marijuana. Fifty percent say that general marijuana use should be legalized, while only 46 percent say it should remain illegal ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/Record-Hig... ). "
0," The vitamin D3 secret for preventing cancer is seeping into the mainstream media (MSM). But it's still a long way from getting the publicity that Koman for the Cure and their ilk promote as revenue producing, worthless cancer prevention measures. You won't hear or read too many cancer clinics and family doctors advising people on maintaining a high D3 blood level to protect against cancer either. The official RDA (recommended daily allowance) for vitamin D3 is way too low to maintain the D3 blood level of 40 to 60 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter). ( http://www.selfnews.com/031688_vitamin_D_chronic_disease.html ) That's the vitamin D3 blood level promoted by vitamin D3 experts, several holistic doctors, and naturopaths for protecting against cancer. Most doctors still consider 20 ng/ml normal. But PubMed asserts 40 to 74 ng/ml as normal. The possible toxic range is beyond 100 ng/ml, according to the Vitamin D Council Vitamin D3 cancer prevention coverage going mainstream, bit by bit The LA Times science section covered a recent study done in Spain by the Spanish Cancer Research Center , and published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Positive studies on the merits of vitamin D3 for preventing breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer had already been performed and published. So Dr. Nuria Malets and her team decided to focus on bladder cancer instead. Bladder cancer is an epidemic in Spain. They divided slightly over 2,000 test subjects in half. One half hospitalized with bladder cancer and the other half without bladder cancer. Then they used the standard serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 25(OH)D test, which measures the active form of vitamin D3 produced in the kidneys. The Spanish research team recorded that the 1,000 bladder cancer patients had less serum D3 levels than the 1,000 without bladder cancer. They determined that a low vitamin D3 level doubles the chance of bladder cancer. Separating patients with more aggressive bladder cancers revealed that risks are six times higher with low D3 blood levels . One aspect of vitamin D3's ability to prevent cancer is a protein that D3 provides to curb cancer. Vitamin D3 is more of a hormone than a vitamin, and it has regulatory adaptogenic properties. It boosts what's needed and lessens what's overabundant. The LA Times article did not reveal the actual numeric 25(OH)D readings from the Spanish research team to indicate what they considered low. What this means for you Increasing bare skin exposure to direct sunlight is the optimum vitamin D3 booster. Tanning beds that use UVB (ultra-violet B) rays work also. UVB rays are what helps your skin's fat cells start the vitamin D3 process. Vitamin D3 (not D2) supplements from natural sources are also beneficial. Ignore the official RDA minimum requirement. Many safely and effectively supplement 5,000 to 10,000 iu (international units) daily of natural vitamin D3. A California study determined that up to 40,000 IU supplemented daily for a short term was not toxic. Your body automatically stops D3 production when sunshine or other UVB rays have your D3 level maxed out. Instead of relying on frequent mammograms or prostate checks that have proven to give false reads and actually increase cancer risks, boost your vitamin D3 intake with more sunlight exposure to bare skin and/or supplements. You may wish to check with 25(OH)D testing and decide your dosage from there, or trust your intuition. Try to get the 25(OH)D test from a holistic doctor who understands vitamin D3's implications. So the vitamin D3 protection plan works for serious diseases as well as maintaining your immunity to help prevent colds and flues. Sunshine is free and vitamin D3 supplements are inexpensive. This is a very cost effective cancer protection plan. "
0," Tweet In an ongoing effort to scientifically validate the age-old belief that mind-body interventions have a beneficial impact on the health of cancer patients, researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have shown that breast cancer patients who participate in a yoga program during treatment have improved quality of life, compared to patients who do not. The study, presented today at the 42nd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology by Lorenzo Cohen, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Integrative Medicine Program at M. D. Anderson, is one of the first to incorporate yoga as part of a treatment plan for cancer patients. It's also the first collaborative research effort representing the partnership between M. D. Anderson and India's largest yoga research institution, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (research foundation) in Bangalore, India. 'Cancer and its treatments are associated with considerable distress, impaired quality of life and reduced physical function. This is particularly true for women with breast cancer who receive multi-modality treatment over an extended period of time,' Cohen says. 'With our studies, we think that we could help ameliorate the treatment-related side effects that accumulate in cancer patients over time. 'The main objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating a daily yoga program into the treatment care plan for women with breast cancer undergoing radiation treatment, and determine if this is something the patients found useful and enjoyable, as well as assessing aspects of their quality of life,' he continued. Sixty-one women with breast cancer undergoing radiation were randomized to participate in the yoga classes twice weekly at, or around, the time of their radiation appointments, or, as the control group, to be offered yoga post-treatment. The patients ranged from Stage 0 to Stage 3 disease; 48 percent had undergone breast-conserving surgery, and 75 percent had received chemotherapy prior to radiation treatment. The yoga program was designed specifically for this patient population - emphasizing breathing and relaxation, and excluding some positions, for example, that would be difficult, given the patients' possible weakened range of motion. After just one week of yoga and radiation, the patients reported significantly increased physical function, as well as general health, compared to the control group. The study participants also reported marginally better social functioning, significantly lower levels of sleep-related daytime dysfunction, as well as marginally lower levels of fatigue overall. However, no differences in the level of depression or anxiety were found between the two groups. 'It was gratifying to see that we could make a clinically significant difference in these quality of life of these women in such a brief program,' says Kavita Chandwani, M.D., yoga instructor and co-investigator responsible for overseeing the trial. 'Whether it's yoga or some other type of mind-body program, we believe this study shows how beneficial it is to participate throughout treatment to help with quality of life-based issues.' As a result of these positive findings, a follow-up study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, in breast cancer patients receiving radiation comparing yoga to stretching exercises and standard care is ongoing at M. D. Anderson. Also, from the ASCO highlighted study, Cohen and his team plan to analyze the cortisol levels, a stress hormone collected from saliva samples, and immune function measured from blood samples that were both collected as part of the study. M. D. Anderson recognizes the growing body of research indicating that relaxation-based interventions can contribute to the well-being of people with cancer. Through the Integrative Medicine Program, complementary therapies are offered through M. D. Anderson's freestanding facility, Place ... of Wellness, and are used in concert with mainstream care to manage symptoms, relieve stress, and enhance quality of life for patients and their caregivers. M. D. Anderson's Integrative Medicine faculty also conduct research in the biological and behavioral effects of mind/body based interventions; the anti-cancer potential of natural compounds; and acupuncture to treat common cancer treatment-related side effects. Recently, Cohen and his team received a $2.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effects of Tibetan yoga in women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy; the grant is the largest ever to study Tibetan yoga in cancer patients.

0," Climate change, a phrase that typically instills fear in society, is being eyed by Arizona State University as something that could be beneficial. Contrary to those who view climate change as only having catastrophic consequences, experts from the university suggest that it is responsible for re-greening parts of the world and changing lives for the better. Experts from the university engaged in a study that ultimately showed that the West African Sahel, the strip south of the Sahara desert, has been 'regreening' ever since droughts in the 1970s and 80s killed more than 100,000 people. They maintain that increased rainfall caused by climate change has led to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which has spurred more plant growth and community-led farming efforts. The region is turning around and experiencing a vast change from the drought and deaths that once plagued it. The area is greening, plants are growing, and people are coming together. These changes bring improvements in the physical and emotional well-being of the region's inhabitants, which can ultimately bolster relationships and reverse poverty levels. Despite positive outcomes from climate change, fears persist The journal that published this information, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ( PNAS ), states that '...long-term satellite-derived greenness sensitivity to rainfall' was analyzed to better understand '...changing vegetation structure in different regions of the Sahel.' According to the paper, 'Our results show that remotely sensed vegetation greenness...has increased across the Sahel since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, consistent with increasing rainfall and earlier analyses.' The report was titled, 'On regreening and degradation in Sahelian watersheds.' Unfortunately, there are some people cling tightly to negative views about change of any kind, and climate change is no different. The alarmist web site DeSmog is one such outlet, and it is said to have jumped on Arizona State University's Sahel findings. They vehemently stated that, 'The greening is unreliable. It is thus hardly an encouraging example of a 'positive impact' from global warming.' Perhaps in anticipation of naysayer attitudes like that of DeSmog, the PNAS paper states: Meanwhile, in the popular press and often in the environmental and development literature, the reports of recovery are sometimes forgotten to the extent that popular opinion in the West - and indeed very often in Africa - holds fast to pessimistic images of overgrazing, degradation, sand storms, and sand-dunes 'marching' south from the Sahara towards the sea. The differences in perception of recent changes highlight the need to quantify the extent of recovery (or otherwise) in Sahelian systems since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s and the extent to which vegetation changes in the Sahel respond proportionally to climate variations. Embrace change rather than resist it Without a doubt, climate change is occurring. In fact, at a 2014 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) conference attended by about 1,000 climate experts in Canada, there was much talk of significant climate changes that could be experienced by 2050. Gigantic waves, increased in-flight air turbulence, flash flooding, dramatic temperature surges, and superstorms are expected to become more commonplace. We've seen it already; areas that haven't seen snow in many years - if ever - have suddenly been blanketed by it. Other regions are dealing with extreme cold or heat. The changes continue, and we must learn to change along with them. Rather than adopting a fearful attitude, it might be best for society to focus on moving forward. Perhaps making an effort to work smarter and in tandem with climate changes instead of resisting them would improve life on the planet. "
0," Healthy shoppers in Northern California are getting the first taste of certified biotech-free meat and egg products at the grocery store, thanks to the valiant efforts of the Non-GMO Project in successfully convincing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to allow certified non-GMO labels to be placed on foods within its regulatory jurisdiction. According to a recent press release issued by the Non-GMO Project , the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) has finally agreed to allow third-party certifying organizations like the Non-GMO Project to certify meat and egg products that meet its strict integrity standards, as long as the claims made are truthful, accurate and not misleading. Most of the food on the market today is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which does not require this type of pre-approval of third-party labels. The USDA, on the other hand, which regulates meat and liquid egg products, has not traditionally held any third-party labeling standards, and had previously denied requests made by meat companies like Mary's Chicken to allow non-GMO labels because of this. With the help of the Non-GMO Project , however, Mary's Chicken and others in the industry have been able to work with regulators to carefully develop non-GMO labeling standards that are honest, accurate and transparent, three things health-conscious individuals are looking for these days. And with their goal finally achieved, consumers will now be able to identify the highest quality meat and egg products while shopping. 'It was a thoughtful process, that's most certainly the case,' says Claire Herminjard, head of pastured beef company Mindful Meats, about working with the USDA on non-GMO labeling standards, as quoted by TakePart.com . 'They took their time to do their due diligence to understand how the Non-GMO Project verifies products - what their standards are, how they control that and how they audit it.' Rigorous testing methods ensure Non-GMO Project verified meat, eggs free of transgenic contaminants However, meat and eggs cannot simply be tested on their own for GMO content because the animals that produced them may or may not have been fed GM soy, corn, and other types of transgenic feed. The process is much more complicated, in other words, and in order to properly certify such products , the Non-GMO Project had to establish a more thorough assessment and evaluation process. 'Meat and eggs cannot be tested themselves for GMOs,' says Megan Westgate, Executive Director of the Non-GMO Project in a recent statement posted at the organization's website. 'That's why we test the animal feed. The supplemental language will help clarify that.' Now that the details of the new regulatory process have been fully fleshed out, meat companies like Mindful Meats and Mary's Chicken, egg company Hidden Villa Ranch and others are beginning to sell certified non-GMO products on the consumer market. And there are sure to be many other companies with similar philosophies that will join their ranks in the coming months. 'It means everything to have this label and we're very thankful that FSIS worked with us to get this approved,' says David Pittman from Mary's Chicken, which currently has 17 Non-GMO Project verified products on the market and many more in the process of being verified.

0," For years experts have been warning that the U.S. electrical infrastructure is vulnerable to both manmade and natural threats. Either from an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon fired at the U.S. by an enemy, or from a solar flare caused by major sunspot activity, all the technology that supports our advanced society - from our electrical, banking, water and communications systems, among others - are currently at risk of being totally, and irreparably, destroyed. Finally, a group of GOP lawmakers are taking the threat seriously and have proposed a plan intended to protect the nation's power grid from such threats. Per the Washington Examiner : Dubbed the Secure High-voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage Act , the legislation would push the federal government to install grid-saving devices such as surge protectors to protect against an attack. Increased solar flare activity will continue 'It is critical that we protect our major transformers from cascading destruction. The Shield Act encourages industry to develop standards necessary to protect our electric infrastructure against both natural and man-made EMP events,' said Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who is offering up the bipartisan bill, according to the website. The threat to the nation's electric infrastructure posed by EMP has increased as solar activity has increased in recent years, culminating in the form of solar flares, which are essentially powerful bursts of radiation, according to NASA, which monitors solar activity along with NOAA - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . 'Increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, since the sun's normal 11-year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in late 2013. Humans have tracked this solar cycle continuously since it was discovered in 1843, and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun's peak activity,' NASA said in a press release in May. According to the space agency, several 'mid-level' flares have been seen in recent years. In 2010 NBC News reported that solar activity was on the rise and, more importantly, how that activity could affect technology on earth: Streams of charged particles that fly off the sun can interfere with electronics on Earth and satellites orbiting our planet. For example, during a particularly intense solar storm in 1989, power to an entire Canadian province was knocked out. Since then, other storms have knocked a handful of satellites out of service. 'The problem is solar storms [and] figuring out how to predict them and stay safe from their effect,' Lika Guhathakurta, chairperson for the organization International Living with a Star, during a July 2010 meeting in Bremen, Germany. 'We need to make progress on this before the next solar maximum arrives around 2013.' Ninety-three million miles separate the earth and sun, but that distance is not as great as it seems, in space terms. 'Spacecraft and ground-based observations have determined that Earth is actually located within the sun's outer atmosphere, where it is constantly being battered by solar winds and hail storms of energetic particles,' NBC News reported. EMP attack would destroy our way of life Defense Department officials, lawmakers and experts are also concerned about EMP damage from a nuclear weapon. They have said a relatively small nuclear device detonated above the U.S. could devastate our electrical infrastructure . 'This could be the kind of catastrophe that ends civilization - and that's not an exaggeration,' former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said during a meeting of the House Electromagnetic Pulse Caucus, which was hosted by Franks. He added that he did not think Americans were taking the threat very seriously. 'The reason I began focusing on this a decade ago is there are very few events you can't recover from. You can recover from 9/11, you can recover from Pearl Harbor. This is really different,' he said, according to Politico . 'This creates such a collapse of our fundamental productive capacity that you could literally see a civilization crash and tear itself apart fighting ... internally.' The loss of our power grid would throw civilization back to the Middle Ages, Gingrich has said. The former House Republican leader says were that to happen, 'millions would die' in the first week. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) James Turner, chairman of Citizens for Health , an international non-profit consumer health education group, declares in a press release that he is shocked and outraged after reading a report of the findings of a Duke University study that link the use of the artificial sweetener known as Splenda to weight gain and other health problems. 'The report makes it clear that the artificial sweetener Splenda and its key component sucralose pose a threat to the people who consume the product. Hundreds of consumers have complained to us about side effects from using Splenda and this study confirms that the chemicals in the little yellow package should carry a big red warning label,' Turner warns. Could Using Splenda Make You Fat? The study, which was published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part A , provides 'evidence that, in the animals studied, Splenda reduces the amount of good bacteria in the intestines by 50%, increases the pH level in the intestines, contributes to increases in body weight and affects the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the body in such a way that crucial health-related drugs could be rejected,' according to the press release. Instead of being absorbed as intended, Turner notes that medicines such as those used for chemotherapy, AIDs treatment or heart conditions could go right to the intestines instead. While the study was conducted using male rats, researchers were able to evaluate the results to determine possible side effects in humans. Turner notes that a rat study was also used by the manufacturers of Splenda to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to market the product to humans. Use Over Time Could Cause Side Effects 'A person eating two slices of cake and drinking two cups of coffee containing Splenda would ingest enough sucralose to affect the P-glycoprotein, while consuming just seven little Splenda packages reduces good bacteria,' Turner explains. While there is no cause for concern for one-time use, Citizens for Health reports that side effects can occur after use over a period of time. Turner also mentions that Johnson & Johnson reports that Splenda is not absorbed by fat and that there is now 'unmistakable evidence' to the contrary. Consumer Group Wants Warning Label on Splenda The California Assembly Committee on Health will hear testimony from Citizens for Health on October 3, 2008. The committee is looking into the use of deceptive advertising in order to encourage the sale of unhealthy food products (like artificial sweeteners), according the press release. 'We are calling today on the FDA to immediately accept our petition filed over a year ago and initiate a review of its approval of sucralose and to require a warning label on Splenda packaging cautioning that people who take medications and/or have gastrointestinal problems avoid using Splenda. The FDA should not continue to turn a blind eye to this health threat,' said Turner.

0," U.S. biotechnology company AquaBounty has been ordered to pay nearly the maximum possible fine for multiple violations of environmental law in its experimental genetically modified (GM) salmon-growing operation in Panama. In response, the advocacy organizations Food & Water Europe, Food & Water Watch, the Center for Food Safety and Friends of the Earth U.S. called on the FDA to reject AquaBounty's pending application for the commercialization of GM salmon in the United States. 'The FDA has always assured the public that it is checking, monitoring and regulating AquaBounty's production platform to ensure that the company can mitigate the well-documented environmental impacts of escaped GM salmon,' said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Europe. 'We now know that AquaBounty is unwilling or unable to follow basic rules and regulations, and that the FDA is unable or unwilling to enforce them. It's time to put an end to this dangerous experiment.' Latest in string of mishaps The AquaBounty salmon are Atlantic salmon -- the species of salmon that are farmed and are thus most commonly found in stores and restaurants -- that have had genes from eelpout and Pacific Chinook salmon inserted into their DNA. The company claims that these changes cause the fish to produce abnormally high levels of growth hormone and therefore grow as much as six times faster than usual. At the end of October, the Panamanian National Environmental Authority ruled that AquaBounty had violated a wide range of environmental safety rules, including failure to secure the proper water use and discharge permits. The violations were brought to the government's attention by national environmental group Centro de Incidencia Ambiental (Environmental Advocacy Center). 'We are of the opinion that it [AquaBounty] has repeatedly violated the aforementioned environmental regulations,' Panama's National Environmental Authority said, leveling a fine of US$9,500. This is just shy of the maximum US$10,000 fine permitted by Panamanian law. The regulatory slapdown is only the latest problem to plague AquaBounty's Panamanian operations, including the disappearance (and likely escape) of salmon during a storm, and a visiting journalist describing the facility as a 'run-down shed.' Raises greater safety questions The latest news lends credence to long-standing accusations that AquaBounty selected a remote location for its facility as a way to avoid serious scrutiny. It also supports arguments that the FDA's regulatory approval process for the GM salmon is flawed. Under the current process, the FDA is considering only a single production scenario, as promised by AquaBounty: The company raises the salmon at a Panamanian facility, then sends fillets back to the U.S. This would be the first GM animal approved for human consumption anywhere in the world. 'One of the big reasons we are fighting the U.S. approval of GM salmon for food is the grave doubts surrounding the ability of either AquaBounty or the U.S. food system to keep these GM fish out of exports headed our way,' said Eve Mitchell, EU food policy advisor for Food & Water Europe. She noted that, in contrast to European practice, GM foods are not even labeled in the United States. AquaBounty's failure to follow Panamanian law undermines the credibility of its promises to the FDA, critics said. 'If AquaBounty doesn't even have legal permission to do what it is doing, it only adds to worries that the entire regulatory process is too full of holes to be trusted, especially on something as important as a safety assessment,' Mitchell said. 'We do not want GM salmon in the EU, and we don't think anyone else does either, so it's time for the FDA to reject the application and put this thing behind us.' "

'Fresh fruits and vegetables may be more expensive, but I believe that the risk is too high not to spend the extra,' said BPA researcher and obstetrician Hugh Taylor of Yale University, who advises pregnant women to avoid canned food. 'The entire life of that individual may be altered by a few months of BPA exposure in pregnancy. This is where the greatest risk lies.' BPA is an industrial chemical used to make plastic hard, as in water and infant bottles, and also to make liners for food and beverage cans. It has been strongly established as an estrogen mimic that disrupts the endocrine (hormonal) system, with potentially serious effects on development, the reproductive system and the brain. The U.S. National Toxicology Program recently ruled prenatal and childhood exposure to the chemical a cause for concern, prompting the FDA to revisit its decades-long stance that BPA is safe. The EPA has also declared it a chemical of concern. In the new study, conducted by a coalition of 19 environmental groups known as the National Workgroup for Safe Markets, researchers found drastically different BPA levels even between different cans of the same product. For example, levels of BPA in cans of Del Monte French Style Green Beans varied from 36 to 138 micrograms per serving. The higher concentrations detected have been linked with changes to the prostate gland and increased aggression in animal studies. The workgroup has issued a report calling on Congress to ban all use of BPA in food and beverage containers. Already, five states, the city of Chicago and three New York counties have banned its use in some children's products. 'We are programming the hormonal response of the next generation,' Taylor said. 'The worst effects may not become apparent for years.' Sources for this story include: http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-05-... . "
0," The FBI and, indeed, the whole of the U.S. intelligence community, is under fire once more for fabricating 'terrorist' attacks and then 'thwarting' them before they take place, as a means of further empowering the surveillance state and power of the federal government. According to NBC News , FBI agents have arrested an Ohio man who allegedly was attempting to set up an ISIS cell in the United States and planning an attack against the U.S. Capitol Building. However, U.S. officials also told NBC News that there was never any danger because the government set up the whole thing. NBC News provided additional details: Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, of Green Township, near Cincinnati, was arrested after he bought two M-15 semi-automatic rifles and about 600 rounds of ammunition as the undercover operative watched, according to an FBI affidavit. Government officials said Cornell never purchased any pipe bomb components. 'There was never a danger to the public,' one official said. Cornell faces a preliminary court hearing Jan. 22 in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. He will face charges of attempting to kill a U.S. government officer and possession of a firearm in furtherance of an attempted crime of violence. FBI officials say they got on to Cornell after being tipped by an informant in August that he was posting comments under the alias 'Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah' on Twitter in support of ISIS. Shortly thereafter, the FBI sent an operative undercover to meet with him. Set up by the FBI - never would have happened, otherwise Court documents say that, during a meeting with the FBI's operative, Cornell said he wished 'to go forward with violent jihad' and that was something encouraged by Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. born Muslic cleric who was killed by an American drone strike in September 2011 , becoming the first U.S. citizen known publicly to have been added to the U.S. kill-or-capture list of terrorist suspects. The FBI alleges that Cornell made it perfectly clear that he wanted to create an ISIS cell in the United States. The agency says Cornell told the undercover agent in a text message: 'I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves.' NBC News further noted: Later, in a meeting in November, the FBI said, Cornell said he wanted to 'build, plant, and detonate pipe bombs at and near the U.S. Capitol,' then 'shoot and kill employees and officials.' Critics say that the FBI is intentionally ginning up terrorist threats so that the agency, along with the intel community at large, as well as friendly lawmakers, can justify higher intelligence budgets and more draconian surveillance and arrest measures. As noted on Activist Post : The FBI is at it again. Creating fake terror plots to justify their existence. And this plot hits on all the themes one would expect from a good fake terror plot. The FBI initially found a patsy by trolling Twitter for support of ISIS. That's exciting because finding someone retarded enough to admit support for them is really difficult. Then they sent an in-house jihadist to team up with the patsy to plan a grand terror attack on the nation's Capitol. Heroically, the moment the 20-year-old patsy said he would 'go forward with violent jihad' the FBI steps in and declares a victory in the war on terror. History of 'abuse ' under ' guise of counterterrorism ' The FBI has been 'staging' false terror attacks for some time: -- In September 2011, Britain's The Guardian newspaper reported on 'fake terror plots' and 'paid informants' to 'entrap' 'terrorist' suspects. That story is here . -- Activist Post reported on a phony FBI 'terror plot' in October 2012; that post is here . -- In November 2011, Reuters reported on another lone wolf patsy here . -- The ACLU has been following the FBI's 'record of extraordinary abuse... under the guise of counterterrorism after 9/11.' That report is here . Sources: http://www.nbcnews.com http://www.activistpost.com http://www.theguardian.com http://www.activistpost.com http://www.reuters.com "
0," The Batman-murder psy-op is expanding. It aims to blow up one horrible crime into a vicious general lie. Now we're told that a U of Colorado 'threat assessment team' was aware of 'problems with James Holmes' in June, a month before he committed murder and mayhem in the Aurora theater. http://www.ydr.com/nation-world/ci_21213539/?source=hot_topics The covert op is unfolding. 'Threat assessment team' is a way of claiming that problems Holmes was having are not unique to him; in fact, this is a society-wide problem. Otherwise, why would a threat assessment team exist in the first place? And what is the supposed problem? Mental illness. It's a chronic epidemic. The subliminal psyop asserts that derangement is in the nature of the human condition; more specifically, it's in the nature of the brain. 'Threat assessment team' becomes a symbol that lets the public know the Batman murders are a symptom of a wider situation. According to the promoted story line, we the people need threat assessment teams, and not just at the U of Colorado. The op called the Aurora massacre isn't just about taking people's guns away. It's about inventing a pressing need for controlling mental illness before it manifests as violence. And once that fallacious concept is planted, the psyop pros can not only suggest we have to snitch on 'suspicious behavior,' they can demand the government expand threat assessment throughout society in order to make predictions and grab people and 'treat' them before they spin out of control and do something horrible. Who assesses and predicts threat? Who develops algorithms that can identify potential murderers among us? Psychiatrists. In 1988, in my book, AIDS INC., I warned that fascism would stand the best chance of spreading across the world through medical operations, because 'medical science' flies no partisan political banners, seems to take no side, appears to be all about objective research and healing. So YOU are reinvented as a potential Batman murderer. You could go off. You could snap. You could fall victim to a brain malfunction. You could give way to your darker impulses. No one is immune. Therefore, I have to be protected from you, and you have to be protected from me. That's the lie and that's the op. What is the op hiding? The fact that the psychiatric drugs cause violence. It's not mental illness. It's the drugs used to treat invented and concocted and fabricated 'mental disorders.' http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/SMI_AASR.shtml http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro99/web1/Murphy.html http://www.breggin.com In other words, we're looking at a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the widest terms, the op involves randomly seeding society with the violence-causing psychiatric drugs, and then, when inexplicable murders and suicides occur, step in behind that and call it 'mental illness' and implement far-reaching threat-assessment strategies to put the whole society in a straitjacket. When I say 'concoct and invent mental illnesses,' I mean that literally. http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/the-liars-liar/ These so-called disorders are put in place by committees of psychiatrists, who slice and dice and chop human suffering, pain, and confusion into fancy categories, for which there are no diagnostic tests. So it may look like Dr. Lynne Fenton, James Holmes' psychiatrist, and her threat assessment team missed the boat on Holmes and should come in for heavy criticism, but the truth is: the Aurora massacre will only serve to strengthen psychiatry's position as the preeminent authority on violence prevention. Here are two examples of how this bogus 'prevention' will be achieved. Soon, we will see drugs planted with tiny transmitters that remotely let 'health providers' know whether people are complying with their prescribed medication schedules. http://blogs.nature.com What better way to pretend that patients with mental disorders are being kept in line, before they can commit egregious crimes? The other example is far-reaching to the extreme. It is Obamacare itself. Under the new law, the US Dept. of Health and Human Services is tasked with compiling, yes, a comprehensive list of all diseases and disorders. Step two is listing the approved treatments for these conditions. At some point, we will see both the diagnoses and the drugs for: prevention of those (fictional) mental disorders that 'could lead to violence.' The assumption that you or I or anyone could be the next Batman killer will be built into the system. So will the drug 'cure.' On that day, the Brave New World will reveal more of its ugly countenance. The basic and strongest argument against what is coming is the freedom to choose or refuse medication. Universally, people still recognize this principle. They understand it. They support it, intellectually and viscerally. This is a freedom anyone can grasp. It must be pursued without compromise. Otherwise, it could be you who are said to be potentially dangerous. It could be you who are sedated into being harmless and therefore a Safe Citizen. They might even give you an ID package which designates your preferred status. And in your addled condition, you might wear the ID as a badge of honor. What we are witnessing here is Clockwork Orange reconfigured. The jumping off point is James Holmes. But unlike the key figure in Stanley Kubrick's film, Holmes doesn't have to be the actual killer. He could merely be a designated patsy left holding the bag. He is, either way, the occasion for implementing medical strategies to condition people into androidal 'inner peace.' Which means passivity, and the acceptance of the Psychiatric Society.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Renegade Water Secrets, which can be found at ( http://www.renegadewatersecrets.com ) . In this excerpt, Iain Trousdell talks about embracing a water philosophy. Renegade Water Secrets with Iain Trousdell, founder of New Zealand's Living Water Institute. Kevin: Someone who's hearing this call, they have an interest in water and the different aspects of water, what it can do, how does someone embrace this kind of philosophy and use it for... there's a higher consciousness, I guess. Iain: Well, I think the world definitely needs a higher consciousness. That's self evident. So how we find that is a marvelous dynamic drama and it's very important, central. But we've worked our group in our very simple companies and their research institutes have worked mostly privately and we got to a point and then our government did help us occasionally, private corporations would help us if there was someone in there who understood what we were talking about and appreciated what we were doing. So turning around in the last five or six years, Kevin, maybe a bit more, that suddenly thinking in the West is changing so rapidly in a positive manner, thank goodness, and folks are not just giving us sick grins when we start talking about what we're doing. Kevin: Right. Iain: That's how it used to be. 'Oh, go hug a tree.' You know, you're just talking about fairies but now they're going 'Oh, wow, really?' and 'Tell me more,' or 'how can I find out more?' So we're in the process of setting up internet websites and ways of becoming part of databases and being on the map soon. Kevin: Right. Iain: So one way that folks could associate themselves with us is to go to ( www.healingwaterinstitute.net ) and just a bit down the left, there's a sign up form there and you get free autoresponder emails on the creative secrets of water I send to you over a 10-12 week period, just explaining more on the sort of things that you and I have been discussing today. I've also recently bought waterfriends.net, which no one had. Kevin: Okay. Iain: So we were planning to develop that as a group of people who can find ways of helping around the world in different ways. Kevin: Now, what is your own practice with water? Are you experimenting with the Flow Forms for your own drinking consumption? Iain: Oh, yes, I do. I also use them for my garden and for treatment of catalytic materials to empower the garden. Kevin: Let's talk about that a little bit. Iain: Sorry, what's that? Kevin: Talk about that a little bit. Iain: That's the bionamics agriculture. Kevin: Okay. Iain: And Rudolf Steiner gave a number of very interesting recipes for developing extra life supporting capacity in the soil and one of them, in particular, is cow manure which gets placed into a cow horn which has a spiral and you leave it in the ground over winter and in the spring, it has a remarkable quality where if you mix it rhythmically with water and spray that water out over your property, the living organisms in the soil respond in a truly remarkable way which is now being scientifically proven and annotated over an 80-year period. For instance, in India, it was the scientists at the agricultural colleges who first got most excited about bionamics when it was introduced to them by Peter Proctor in New Zealand and who's now in his 80's. And it spread from their scientific research into the villages and cooperatives. So we use Flow Forms as part of that because of the increasing capacity to support life. Kevin: You use Flow Forms to mix? Iain: To stir the cow manure. We do drink... we run our tap water through Flow Forms to drink at home, but primarily what's happened to me is, I've been a teacher over many years, but at the same time did Flow Forms. I've worked with Flow Forms; I've been personally involved in 400-450 projects around the Pacific. I've lived in New Zealand most of that time. Major projects are city centers, kindergartens, hospitals, therapeuticoms, many home gardens, ponds -- it's remarkable what they do for a pond because many people dig ponds and of course in nature, a pond, unless it's a monsoon or been captured by flash flooding, has a stream. Kevin: Right. Iain: And the stream keeps the pond alive. The pond can't move properly or have moving water coming through it. Of course, it becomes stagnant and all sorts of creatures like mosquitoes and malaria and what have you, so also algae. So we've got remarkable stories of introducing Flow Form-treated water to ponds. Kevin: And how does that happen? Iain: Even with ponds that have had running water going into them, we just put a Flow Form into the running water and even then there's a remarkable change. Kevin: And how does... Iain: There's been scientific research from Holland, Sweden and many other places. Kevin: You put it into the water source? How does that happen? Iain: The Flow Form? Kevin: Yeah. Iain: For instance, take swimming pools. We've got five or six swimming pools in New Zealand which have no chlorine use at all. Basically, your swimming pool is a captured body of water that gets taken out through a filter and sort of pumped and whacked back into the pools. So it's not really helping the water a lot except chemically cleaning it and then, because of the pathogens that can develop in this water that doesn't support life, we throw in a ton of chlorine which kills off stuff and that also impacts the water quality. So the water's basically an unhappy chappy in there. So I've never had anyone, if I say to them, 'Would you like water to go through a mountain stream.' And everyone goes 'Well, yeah, of course, that would be great.' Okay, would you like the mountain stream to be artistic, sound beautiful, relaxing and, hey we'll throw a heart pulse in as well just as added measure. So people have these. They get five, seven Flow Forms set up by their swimming pool and suddenly the water's soft and silky and sparkly and feels fresh and there's just the need to put the same amount of chlorine in it. Of course, we tell people to test it and do everything and watch their health and all the legal issues. Kevin: Sure. Iain: Some folk have natural swimming pools so it looks like a mountain pond. They've got trees in it and filtration and it gets run through a biological filter, reeds and rushes and Flow Forms... So that's fun. We can do that. It's another one of our 40 niche markets. And so we're setting up also our business Nature Intelligence International. My company, Design for Life, with my teams in New Zealand, we're joining forces commercially with John Wilkes and his company in England created a company called Nature Intelligence and we're just starting that company now in America and have interest from 7 or 8 different countries to start business there and there have been inquiries from 53 countries now for Flow Forms over the last 30 years. Two and a half thousand, two thousand four hundred or so projects have been completed in that time. Kevin: Wow. Iain: We are ready now with means of mass production which we've developed ceramics in Vietnam with wonderful colleagues there and also a method of rotational composite stone crafting, so we're ready to mass produce and we just got ourselves to this point with regard to the business and also our Healing Water Institutes in New Zealand and Britain and we're setting one up in America. Kevin: Okay and where do you see this in the future, say 10, 15, 20 years. Iain: Well, I think we have a realistic approach. We estimate that... we are planning to sell hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Flow Forms in the next 15-20 years and we've got a number of folks, some of them high-level international water consultants, coming to us saying 'You're going to need hundreds of millions of dollars to gear up with the world need for Flow Forms once people realize what you're doing' and so we're happy with a few million to get that up and going. But that was his point. He's saying 'How about eco-villages?' You've got thirty thousand houses... They're being built all over the place now. When I'm going around, for instance, to places like this or spas or hotel chains, I've had someone else tell me about eco-villages, an engineer who's working in London. So say there's a town of thirty thousand houses all being built, everything's perfect, top level sustainability, and they go, 'Well, of course, we've got to have Flow Forms in there to enliven the water.' Kevin: Right, like if it's captured rain water? Iain: Captured rain water, tap water, once the science gets a bit clearer, we're just collaborating with a couple of our top Ph.D. guys who are working with us collecting more scientific research and more modern theoretical basis for the way we work. We're up to 80 pages. It's going to turn into 100 and we'll publish that. And this is scientific work that Ph.D. guys from top level universities are prepared to put their name on. Kevin: Right. Iain: So when these sort of things are published, we bring all the marketing and the knowledge and the propensity to produce, all of that together. So our hope is it's conceivable we get an engineering building group who says 'Okay, we need three Flow Forms for each of the thirty thousand houses, when can you deliver?' Kevin: Right. Iain: So we get an order for ninety thousand Flow Forms and I think that's only a year or two away. Kevin: That's great, that's great. Iain: We've been preparing for this for seven years now, Kevin. Our group down in New Zealand and John's excited about us and it's an exciting entrepreneurial venture combined with our research and design. Kevin: And how do you see it changing the people who are living in those environments? Iain: Sorry, I'm missing that. Kevin: How do you see it changing or affecting the people who are living in those environments? Iain: Well, it's very interesting. Again, this is anecdotal, but we get people telling us 'Hey, we can sleep better. We're not just so stressed. We're just relaxing...' We have already set them up in kindergartens, for instance, and the kids just love them. Because you're feeling life is in your rhythmic system, in your heart and in your chest, when we live in such an arrhythmic out of touch world, often, don't we, in cities and when people consciously or unconsciously are in an environment which has a rhythmic sound, soft and relaxing sort of environment, the air changes, the earth. Something pretty fundamental changes in them. I've had some extraordinary statements from folks and kindergartens -- we get children who are a bit overactive, they tend to calm down and focus on what's happening in their marvelous little stream. And the kids who are a bit shy, come along and start to talk and people cooperate. It's remarkable. It's just simply remarkable. Kevin: Well, I think that's probably a great way to end this interview here. Iain: Well, indeed, it's a huge topic and it's a very exciting one. Water is the big issue, as you know, with regards to your project putting all these things together. There are two billion people at the moment who have daily problems getting fresh water for drinking, washing and cooking.

0," Army Veteran Donald Siefkin wasn't asking for much when he called the emergency room at the Seattle VA Hospital on February 27. The 64-year-old was parked just a few feet from the ER entrance and was in severe pain from a broken foot he had suffered earlier that day. The pain was getting worse, and his foot swelled to the 'size of a football' on a 3.5-hour drive to the Seattle-Tacoma airport from his home in Kennewick, Washington. While preparing to take his wife to the airport to catch a red-eye flight, Siefkin had 'stepped down funny and heard a snap.' During the drive, the swelling and pain increased so he decided to head straight for the Seattle VA hospital to seek medical care before attempting to drive back home. By the time Siefkin reached the hospital parking lot at around 3:30 am, the pain had become excruciating, so he called the emergency room front desk to request assistance getting inside. He could no longer walk because of the swelling and the pain, and he needed someone to bring a wheelchair and push him inside the building. This sounds like a manageable request, right? The hospital employee who answered the phone refused Siefkin's request. After a brief argument, the employee told him, 'No, we're not going to come get you. You're going to have to call 911 and you'll have to pay for that.' The employee then hung up on him. A Seattle Times article about the incident says: By 3:47 a.m., a Seattle fire captain and three firefighters manning Engine Company 30 arrived to wheel Siefken into the ER. Staff members examined him, took X-rays, put a boot on his foot and prescribed Hydrocodone for his pain. Siefken, who declined to take the medication for fear he'd be unsafe to drive, drove back home to Kennewick after the hospital wouldn't put him up for the night. He arrived four hours later, took a painkiller and crawled into bed. When initial inquiries were made about the case, Chad Hutson, spokesman for the Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, said: 'I know it sounds counterintuitive because someone is just 10 feet away, but it is our policy to do that.' Later, however, the VA contradicted that statement and issued a written apology, which stated in part: When the Veteran told our emergency room staff that he did not have an urgent or emergent medical issue, our staff should have considered the request for help as a patient assistance issue. The emergency room personnel should have called the appropriate staff to come and assist the patient, ensuring he made it into the emergency room safely. Siefkin was satisfied with the apology, saying: They said they're sorry and they're going to change things so this doesn't happen again. That's all I really wanted.' Siefkin's experience was far from the worst that the men and women who served our country have endured in recent years. Thousands of complaints have been filed against the VA, and in many cases, veterans have died while waiting to receive treatment or have been killed due to malpractice on the part of VA doctors and staff. This case is just a clear illustration of how absurd and wrong-headed VA policies and practices can be. This incident begs the question: how can President Obama justify busing illegal aliens thousands of miles to drop them off in U.S. cities, when a VA hospital can't even wheel an injured vet 10 feet to receive medical care? After all, both are the responsibility of the Executive Branch. Sources: http://www.seattletimes.com "
0," The human body is under oxidative stress from a variety of sources at all times. To combat this stress and damage the body utilizes anti-oxidants of all different varieties. Glutathione (GSH) is a very special peptide molecule that provides the greatest anti-oxidant protection and recharges other anti-oxidants within the body. Every cell in the body produces glutathione. Many longevity scientists believe that the level of glutathione in our cells is predicative of how long we will live. This is logical considering the wealth of essential bodily processes that glutathione plays a critical role in. Glutathione has been coined with the term 'master anti-oxidant' due to its essential role in maintaining exogenous anti-oxidants such as vitamin C & E in their active form. Glutathione is like the cell's security guard protecting the genetic equipment from outside attack. It is estimated that each cell in the body withstands 10,000 hits by free radicals each day. Glutathione disarms these free radicals before they wreak havoc and cleans up the oxidative stress related damage that has occurred. Glutathione plays a significant role in immune function. Studies have shown that glutathione strengthens T cells, which are critical for modulating the immune system appropriately. These are the cells that coordinate the attack against pathogenic bacteria, viruses, etc. while keeping tissue damage and auto-immune responses in check. An overactive immune system can trigger allergies and auto-immune disease processes. Glutathione fights against cellular toxins and works to eliminate carcinogens from the intracellular environment while healing damaged cells. Glutathione is constantly in action protecting the body against disease, toxins, viruses, pollutants, radiation, drugs and oxidative stress. When damage does occur, it immediately goes to work repairing the free radical damage. If sufficient glutathione is not available, the toxins will overload the liver and lead to fat soluble toxins being stored in fatty tissues. The central nervous system, breasts, & prostate are the most susceptible areas. Many researchers credit the increase in neurological disease and cancer to depleted cellular glutathione. The brain produces more free radicals than any other tissue and is therefore in need of more glutathione than any other region. Levels of glutathione begin to decline with aging as the majority of individuals in our society become more toxic and deficient. Additionally, our society has more environmental toxicity than ever before, so there is a significant need for more glutathione production. Unfortunately, our modern world diets are void of the necessary precursors for this critical agent. Scientists estimate that the average person by age 20 loses glutathione at 8-12% per decade. Increased health challenges from infection, poor diet, increased toxic load, medication usage, etc. can deplete these stores at a much faster rate. Scientists estimate that a 30% reduction of glutathione is enough for cellular dysfunction to occur. Studies have shown that adequate vitamin D is necessary for optimal glutathione production. The vast majority of our society is extremely deficient in vitamin D. Optimal vitamin D levels should be between 60-100 ng/ml. Glutathione precursors such as glycine, glutamic acid and cysteine should naturally be consumed through our diet. The best vegetable sources include avocados, onions, garlic, turmeric , spinach and cruciferous veggies. Unfortunately, vegetable sources are still very low in these critical amino acids. Good food sources are through high quality, non-denatured animal products. These include bioactive non-denatured grass-fed whey protein, cultured, raw grass-fed dairy products and raw, organic eggs. These cultured, raw grass-fed dairy products are an incredibly good source of highly bioavailable amino acids and offer more cysteine than any other food source. http://www.optimumimmunehealth.com/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione http://www.pointofreturn.com/glutathione.htm...

0," If you currently suffer from persistent food allergies, this common inflammatory intolerance does not necessarily have to be a permanent scourge on your everyday health. New research published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research confirms that food allergies can actually be ameliorated entirely with the right nutritional protocol, mainly a dietary regimen that involves supplementing with high doses of beneficial, probiotic bacteria. Researchers from the Istituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome, Italy, found this out after testing the effects of the VSL#3 brand of probiotics on mice with induced peanut allergies. When given high doses of VSL#3, which contains eight different strains of live and synergistic lactic acid bacteria, the peanut-sensitized mice no longer suffered anaphylaxis or Th2-mediated inflammation when exposed to peanut products. Additionally, the probiotic blend was observed to help improve regulation of the mice's intestinal villi, which absorb nutrients, as well as their mesenteric lymph nodes, which aid the body in fighting off illness. Mesenteric lymph nodes, it turns out, can become inflamed when exposed to allergenic substances, resulting in a condition known as mesenteric lymphadenitis. But probiotics appear to help quell this inflammation. 'TGF-beta, induced in the gut by VSL#3 supplementation, is capable of reducing the Th2 inflammation associated with food anaphylaxis in a mouse model of peanut sensitization,' wrote the authors in their conclusion. 'Probiotics supplementation may represent an effective and safe strategy for treating food allergies in adult population.' Previous research found that probiotics can help cure a host of allergy-related inflammatory bowel diseases Researchers from the Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona in Spain called for more of this kind of research back in 2009 when they published a study in the Swiss journal Digestive Diseases that discussed how probiotics might help alleviate the symptoms of, and perhaps even cure, inflammatory bowel disease in human patients. Not to be confused with irritable bowel syndrome, which is often referred to by the acronym 'IBS,' inflammatory bowel disease, which categorically includes conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is often the direct consequence of repeated exposure to allergenic substances. And the most commonly recommended treatments include taking pharmaceutical drugs and avoiding offending foods and other substances. But researchers who are more privy to the bacterial physiology behind inflammatory bowel disease and the food allergies that often trigger it have long been curious as to how probiotics might help address the underlying cause and potentially even cure it. And the researchers involved in the Spanish study are no exception, having pointed out at the time that a growing body of research supports the notion that underlying bacterial imbalances are the true cause of inflammatory bowel disease. According to this particular study, abnormalities in the way the innate immune system recognizes and responds to certain bacterial and microbiotic antigens is often directly responsible for causing the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. But adjusting the composition of intestinal microbiota with high-dose probiotics has the potential to help correct this serious category of disease by effectively healing the gut. 'Numerous micro-organisms have been evaluated to induce or maintain remission, or both, in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and Pouchitis,' wrote the authors. 'Overall, probiotics have successfully demonstrated some efficacy in some inflammatory bowel disease scenarios.' More recently, a study out of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh found that babies whose mothers supplemented with probiotics during pregnancy have a far lower risk than other babies of ever developing food allergies in the first place. This study, like the others, serves as yet more evidence that healthy gut microbiota are crucial in both preventing and mitigating food allergies and inflammatory bowel diseases. "
0," The news is out: Vitamin D is better than the swine flu vaccine at halting H1N1 infections. In fact, without vitamin D, chances are that a vaccine won't generate much of an immune response in the first place. That's because vitamin D is essential for healthy, active immune function. That's just one of the reasons smart people are choosing vitamin D instead of the swine flu vaccine. Here are nineteen more reasons: #1 Vitamin D activates your immune system to respond to any viral exposure (not just one virus). #2 Vitamin D naturally belongs in your body. #3 Vitamin D has been functioning as medicine in the human body since the beginning of the human species. #4 Vitamin D is available right now and there's no shortage of it. #5 Vitamin D won't cause your brain to swell and put you into a coma. #6 Vitamin D doesn't require an injection with a scary needle. #7 Vitamin D is found naturally in many foods such as sardines or salmon. #8 Vitamin D has a perfect safety record. No one ever died from consuming it. #9 Vitamin D is affordable. You can even get it for free (from sunlight). #10 Vitamin D doesn't contain viral fragments from diseased animals (like vaccines often do). #11 Vitamin D doesn't contain thimerosal or other chemical preservatives. #12 Vitamin D doesn't need a warning sheet describing possible side effects. #13 Vitamin D doesn't hurt your arm when you take it. #14 Vitamin D also improves sugar metabolism, bone density and healthy moods. #15 Vitamin D is safe for the environment. #16 Vitamin D doesn't contain squalene or other inflammatory adjuvant chemicals. #17 Vitamin D works on everyone and is safe for everyone, including infants and children. #18 Vitamin D is made in nature, not a laboratory. #19 Vitamin D is found naturally in breast milk. #20 You can walk, and chew gum, and generate vitamin D from sunshine all at the same time! Skip the vaccine. Get more Vitamin D! And here's a little limerick I wrote about the swine flu vaccine that you might enjoy: The swine flu vaccine was a hoax All the 'science' turned out to be jokes One quick vaccination Caused genetic mutation Turning friendly young girls into blokes "
0," Here's a Merry Christmas to all the selfnews readers from the Health Ranger. And yes, I do specifically mean Merry Christmas. I don't mean just 'Happy Holidays' or 'happy winter break' or even 'happy end-of-year time off.' What I mean is Merry Christmas. That's the holiday name I grew up with and I'm sticking to it. :-) On this merry Christmas, I feel compelled to comment about the ongoing effort to sterilize the English language by removing any words that might dare to impart meaning. I've read reports that certain people feel 'offended' by the term Christmas, and I've watched as public schools have morphed their own descriptions of the Christmas break, removing the word 'Christmas' and replacing it with 'Holiday' as in 'Holiday break' or 'winter break.' The politically-correct language police have, once again, gone too far. This effort to sterilize the language of Christmas only serves to dumb down the children and remove any real meaning from words so that nobody might choose to feel offended by them. Words that say nothing, it seems, are more acceptable in our modern world where political correctness trumps authentic communication. The problem with this approach is that when you sterilize the language, you also remove most of the meaning from the words, leaving an empty shell of strung-together syllables that are designed to say absolutely nothing. Imagine the boss uttering the following at the office Christmas party: 'We are calling this meeting to ascertain the various aspects of this particular time of the year which has been noted by some as deriving itself from an embracing of a period of non-work during which some small gifts may be voluntarily exchanged among persons who optionally feel they wish to do so, but no such gift may exceed a value of twenty dollars, and no gifts may be exchanged that have any particular connotation or personal intent.' This is the sterile, idiotic language environment in which much of America is now suffocating. Use words to communicate, not to placate When it comes to words, you really have two choices: Choice #1) Say nothing . Bite your tongue, sterilize your words, surrender to political correctness and live your life as an entirely ineffectual and spineless word weasel (you can also run for Congress if you're any good at this...) Choice #2) Say what you mean . Use words with purpose while running the risk that somebody somewhere will have an issue with your words, but so what? If people decide to feel offended from your uttering of a holiday name, that's their choice -- NOT your responsibility. This is more of a Jesse Ventura approach. I obviously selected choice #2 many years ago, which is why today I'm saying Merry Christmas . And for those who don't observe the Christmas holiday, Happy Holidays to you! Give yourself the gift of good health One of the best gifts you can give yourself this Christmas, by the way, is the gift of good health. And here at selfnews, we're here to help you accomplish that: In a few days, I'm going to be publishing a list of 50 ways to improve your health in 2010. But if you're a regular reader of selfnews, you probably already know most of what's going to be on that list, so I encourage you to find a balance this year between having a fun celebration and keeping your diet as healthy as possible at the same time. And I'll let you in on a little secret: For a very special occasion like Christmas , I'll even eat some homemade sweets if they're offered to me by family or friends. If you follow a super healthy diet most of the year, there's no harm in relaxing a bit and enjoying some of the more celebratory foods during the holiday season / Christmas season. You don't have to eat just salads and superfoods every single day of the year, you know! But if you do eat some of the more sugared-up, processed foods that you know aren't good for you, use the same defense I do: Chow down some chlorella, spirulina or blue-green algae before you eat the more junky stuff, and you'll go a long way towards protecting yourself from the worst effects of not-so-healthy food. There's a lot of stuff I wouldn't dare touch during a Christmas dinner -- the Christmas ham, for example. Not for me, no thanks! But for the stuff I will eat, like homemade Christmas cookies, they're always accompanied by superfoods, including astaxanthin , resveratrol, oregano oil, berry tinctures or medicinal herbs. So enjoy your Christmas! (Or your holiday, if you don't celebrate Christmas.) Kick back, relax a little, and protect your health with superfoods! Then get ready to rock 'n roll with a new healthy YOU in 2010! We'll be bringing you lots of amazing news and strategies for making 2010 the healthiest year of your life. "

And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!' - Mario Savio, December 2, 1964 Although Mario Savio's speech was about political activism and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Savio ), it could have very well been about Senate Bill 510, the so-called Food Safety Modernization Act . This bill, which is now coming to a vote the evening of Monday, November 29, 2010, is the most 'odious' food tyranny bill to have ever been crafted in the history of our nation. S 510 is to food freedom what the Patriot Act is to the Bill of Rights. If passed, it will criminalize entire ranks of organic gardeners and small farmers while giving rise to a new wave of tyrants -- the food safety Gestapo who will rule over the production of food and the saving of seeds in the same way the TSA now rules over your security at the airport. Watch my 5 minute video on this important topic right now at http://selfnews.tv/v.asp?v=4DE6C8796B5102... The intentions behind S 510 are well-meaning, of course: Lawmakers want to do something about e.coli and salmonella contamination of fresh produce. No US Senator wants to face their constituents without being able to claim they 'voted for safer food .' They all have good intentions. But of course that's exactly what the road to hell is paved with. The Patriot Act was passed with good intentions, too, in a desperate hour when fearful Americans were grasping at solutions -- anything that could calm their fears even if it meant giving up their freedoms in the process. And now we are paying the price for that: Obscene TSA pat-downs at the airport, naked body scanners taking photos of your children's bodies, anti-terrorism laws being used to prosecute animal rights activists, and other such transgressions that were unimaginable in 2001 when it was first passed. What will the next decade bring us if S.510 becomes law? If passed into law, S.510 will become the Patriot Act of the food industry, turning raw milk producers into felons and small organic farmers into 'seed smugglers.' It will all but ensure the demise of small, local farmers and thereby hand a government-protected monopoly to the large industrial farmers who use GMOs, chemical pesticides and cruel, inhumane practices throughout their factory animal farms. It will destroy small dairy farmers and devastate family food producers. And while it's doing all this, it will also give the FDA -- the most dangerous federal agency in the history of our nation -- the power to regulate what you grow, what you harvest, what seeds you save and what paperwork you must file in order to comply with Big Brother's food schemes. It will give the FDA the right to conduct surprise inspections of your greenhouse, to seize your plants and to arrest you as a common criminal merely for milking a cow and offering that fresh milk for sale to a neighbor. This is food tyranny, and this is what we must stop. S. 510 is the machine upon which we must now throw ourselves -- upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and we've got to make it stop. You can help. Here's how: Join our barrage of phone calls to your U.S. Senator's office As soon as you read this, if it's before 5pm Monday, I urge you to pick up the phone and CALL your U.S. Senator's offices and voice your opposition to Senate Bill 510 .

0," The effects of the Western World's less-than-ideal way of farming, coupled with its need for greed, are being felt in countries across the globe and that's definitely not a good thing. In particular, cacao farmers are left scratching their heads, frantically searching for a way to meet a surge in chocolate demand, all the while lacking the resources to make it possible. Yaa Amekudzi, who runs Mondelez's cocoa sustainability operations in Ghana, says that, 'They need to change the way they farm.' If Mondelez isn't familiar to you, perhaps Oreo cookies and Cadbury Dairy Milk bars are; Mondelez is the maker of those popular food items. Amekudzi is concerned, saying that, 'We don't have the forest cover we had, we don't have the rain our grandfathers had, and the soil isn't as fertile.' She explains that young people don't have it in them to carry on the traditions of other generations, often leaving '... to seek a better life in the city.' (1) So becomes the story of what happens when Western values seep into other cultures and environments: Those areas start to experience many of the same issues that are unfolding in the U.S. In other words, destructive habits and a collective disregard for preserving the natural goodness of the earth ensues. Welcome to the Dust Bowl mentality ... Is a Dust Bowl much like the Great Depression when the lands of the Great Plains fell victim to man's make-room-for-me-and-my-greedy-needs attitude spreading globally? Of course it is. It's been happening, and it continues to happen at breakneck speeds. Just as environmental problems happened as a result of the Dust Bowl, when millions of acres of land were destroyed in the name of over-plowing, over-planting and over-grazing ultimately leading to massive dust swirls that drifted over the barren lands similar problems appear to be looming in other parts of the world. After all, the changes that Amekudzi speaks of have Dust Bowl-esque issues written all over them: the depletion of lands, bad soil, diminished crop production and people fleeing in hopes of a better life elsewhere. An 'economic dead end' for farmers, thanks to chemicals, bad farming practices Another case in point: It's explained that Ghana's cacao farming practices leave much to be desired. According to the Ghana Permaculture Institute, cacao is a tremendous industry. However, along with a big industry comes big ideas, many of which are destructive. The site outlines this situation as follows: The problem is, like many big agricultural industries, the cocoa is increasingly being grown in monoculture plantations using new hybrid 'high yielding' varieties. To achieve these high yields you need to use chemical fertilisers. The inevitable problems of pests, diseases and loss of soil fertility monoculture causes are being dealt with by the use of lots of chemical herbicides, pesticides and fungicides all very bad for the health of the land, water and local people, and also an economic dead end for the farmers ... (2) The problem then spirals out of control: along with all the chemicals and fungicides, soil becomes depleted of nutrients; its fertility is compromised; and the entire system in which root systems and fungal networks should harmonize is instead disrupted all from harmful methods to keep big production, and big money, flowing in. But the thing is, it eventually catches up with you, as farmers are beginning to realize, as they stare at dying crops and dwindling financials. (2) Attempts to fix the problem exist, but will people listen? To address the struggles with cacao production in Ghana, Amekudzi says she tries to provide farmers with more effective farming solutions. She often gives advice about how to use fertilizer, prune trees and space seedlings better. (1) As for the Ghana Permaculture Institute, they too suggest a better way of doing things. They advise permaculture , not the ineffective monoculture that currently exists. To this end, this means avoiding chemicals and fixing broken farming practices, which in turn leads to better care of trees, plants and soil and hopefully, improved cacao crop yields. (2) But will Amekudzi's advice and the suggestions for permaculture be enough to bring about the changes that are so desperately needed in the area? One can only hope, because a new way of doing things must be put in place. The Western corporation mentality on many levels, not just cocoa farming must change, for the health of the planet and its inhabitants. "

0," A new study found that residents in large cities who live farther from grocery stores than fast-food restaurants are more likely to die prematurely of diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Researchers conducting the study for LaSalle Bank examined Chicago's south and west sides, where 'food deserts' contain few grocery stores but abound in fast-food restaurants, and where the majority of residents are African-American. The study measured block-by-block distance to the nearest grocery store versus the nearest fast food restaurant, and found that an average African-American block is located twice as far from a grocery store than a fast-food restaurant. Consequently, people in such areas are more likely to die early from heart disease, obesity, cancer and diabetes. More than a half million Chicago residents live in food deserts, with 400,000 more living in areas that have imbalanced food choices, where it's easier to gain access to junk food than healthy food. Lead researcher Mari Gallagher says the study provides a 'statistically significant' link between food choices and health conditions in such food deserts, and that such areas can 'pose serious health and wellness challenges to the residents who live within them and the city as a whole.' The study found that in general, obesity increases as access to a grocery store decreases -- regardless of income levels. ### "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has given care giant Kaiser Permanente over $300,000 to test and interview 150 to 500 patients suffering from Morgellons Disease. The study will be done in northern California where many Morgellons patients live. Prior to this news, people had written off the disease as a hoax or the result of hypochondria. But recent evidence suggests that the disease is indeed real, and may be related to genetically modified (GM) food. What is Morgellons Disease? On August 1, 2007, the CDC issued the following statement regarding Morgellons Disease: 'Morgellons is an unexplained and debilitating condition that has emerged as a public health concern. Recently, the CDC has received an increased number of inquiries from the public, health care providers, public health officials, Congress, and the media regarding this condition. Persons who suffer from this condition report a range of coetaneous symptoms including crawling, biting and stinging sensations; granules, threads or black speck-like materials on or beneath the skin; and/or lesions (e.g., rashes or sores) and some sufferers also report systemic manifestations such as fatigue, mental confusion, short term memory loss, joint pain, and changes in vision. Moreover, some who suffer from this condition appear to have substantial morbidity and social dysfunction, which can include decreased work productivity or job loss, total disability, familial estrangement, divorce, loss of child custody, home abandonment, and suicidal ideation.' As of February, 2007, approximately 10,000 families had registered with the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) and felt they or a member of their family met criteria for Morgellons as defined by the MRF. Of the U.S. families in the MRF registry, 24% reside in California with geographic clustering in the San Francisco metropolitan areas. In New Science magazine, Sept. 15-21 edition, Daniel Elkan describes a patient who for years has been 'finding tiny blue, red and black fibers growing from intensely itchy lesions on his skin.' These fibers appear like pliable plastic and can be several millimeters long. Some appear in a zig-zag pattern. These fibers can be as fine as spider silk, yet they are strong enough to distend the skin when pulled. A May 18, 2006 story carried by KGW, a local news channel in Oregon, recounts the story of a family practice doctor experiencing the disease . She reported feeling like bugs were crawling under her skin. 'If I fully tell people what has gone on with me medically, they think they're in the twilight zone,' said Dr. Drottar who woke up with the feeling that fluid was flowing just below her skin. When black or blue hair-like fibers protruded from her skin, she reported thinking she had been exposed to asbestos. 'I thought I was having asbestos fibers come out of my skin. I was pulling long, thin, small hair-like fibers that were extremely sharp that could literally pierce through my finger nail.' According to Dr. Drottar, these symptoms were accompanied by severe depression, chronic fatigue and a weakened immune system. This debilitating condition forced her to give up her medical practice. Effective treatment for Morgellons suffers has been elusive. Doctors have claimed that this type of disease must be caused by a parasite, but even the strongest anti-parasitic medications have not helped. In the past, psychologists have insisted that this was a new version of delusional parasitosis, a form of psychosis in which suffers hold a delusional belief that they are infected by parasites. The Morgellons, GM Link According to the CDC statement, the etiology of Morgellons is unknown, and the medical community has insufficient information to determine whether persons who identify themselves as having the disease have a common cause for their symptoms. In April, 2006, the CDC recommended an epidemiologic investigation. It was not until January 16, 2008 that the care grant to Kaiser Permanente was announced. In the meantime, a research team from Oklahoma State University lead by Dr. Randy Wymore, studied some of the fibers sent to them by Morgellons patients. They discovered that fibers from different people looked remarkably similar to each other and yet seemed to match no common environmental fibers. Ahmed Kilani, a specialist in infectious disease detection, claimed to have broken down two fiber samples and extracted their DNA. He found that they belonged to a fungus. In an even more provocative finding, Vitaly Citovsky, Professor of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at Stony Brook University in New York, discovered that the fibers contained the substance Agrobacterium, a genus of gram-negative bacteria capable of genetically transforming not only plants, but also other eukaryotic species, including human cells. Anonymous samples were provided to Professor Citovsky by the Morgellons Research Foundation to use in investigating the potential presence of Agrobacterium in biopsies from Morgellons patients. Control reactions included samples provided by healthy donors. Only Morgellons, not healthy subjects, tested positive in these studies. According to a statement issued by Professor Citovsky, this observation does not imply that Agrobacterium causes Morgellons or that Morgellons is indeed an infectious disease. However, it does encourage future studies to determine (1) statistical significance of data, (2) whether Agrobacterium is not only present extracellularly, but also causes genetic transformation of the infected tissues, and (3) whether infection of laboratory animals with Agrobacterium can recreate symptoms of Morgellons.

0," Toxic flame retardant chemicals were found in 100 percent of preschools and day cares tested in a recent study conducted by researchers from the University of California-Berkeley and published in the journal Chemosphere on May 15. 'These findings underscore how widespread these materials are in indoor environments,' researcher Asa Bradman said. 'A growing body of research has found links between flame retardants and a range of human health effects, including neurodevelopmental delays in children. Children are more vulnerable to the health effects of environmental contaminants, so we should be particularly careful to reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals.' Dangerous hormone disruptors After California passed a law in the 1970s requiring a wide array of products to meet incredibly strict anti-flammability standards, manufacturers nationwide began putting flame retardant chemicals in nearly every consumer product, from furniture to electronics. In particular, a class of chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) became ubiquitous in the foam of upholstered furniture. California eventually banned PBDEs in 2006, after evidence emerged linking them to hormone disruption and neurodevelopmental toxicity. The chemicals are still used in many other states, though they have been banned in the European Union. Because of California's strict standards, PBDEs were widely replaced with another class of chemicals called chlorinated tris phosphates, even though these were banned from children's pajamas back in 1977 due to findings that they caused DNA mutations. The state of California now classifies chlorinated tris as a carcinogen. Numerous studies have found flame retardants in the dust of nearly every household tested, and in the bodies of nearly every person. In the new study, researchers took dust samples from the air and floors of 40 child care centers in Alameda and Monterey Counties in California, and tested them for PBDEs and tris phosphates. They found both chemicals in every single sample (100 percent). Those particular counties were selected because they offered a mix of preschools and day care centers in urban, rural and agricultural areas. The levels of PBDEs found in the child care centers were slightly lower than those previously found inside residences, but the levels of chlorinated tris were equivalent to or higher than residential levels. According to Bradman, tris levels were probably higher because the chemicals are used in the foam mats that children nap on. Seventeen of the 40 centers tested had foam napping equipment, and 29 had upholstered furniture. Reduce your exposure The study provides yet more evidence that flame retardants 'are everywhere,' Bradman said. 'Child care environments are not unlike homes and other places where kids spend time, but there has been very little research done on these environments,' he said. But there is good news: At the beginning of 2014, California implemented new flammability standards that only require upholstered furniture fabric to resist smoldering (such as from a dropped cigarette), rather than withstand an open flame. This is considered a more realistic fire-prevention measure that allows the use of flame-resistant materials without the use of retardant chemicals. The new rules are expected to make non-toxic alternatives more widely available. 'The new standard is not a ban on flame retardants, but manufacturers can meet it without using chemicals,' said Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute. 'Most upholstered fabrics, such as leather, are already smolder-proof. Consumers should verify that the furniture they are buying is free of flame retardants, especially when children will be exposed.' Some child care centers already use alternative products, and more are expected to adopt them as they become less expensive. 'Child care professionals are really idealistic and would do anything for the children they're taking care of,' said Ellen Dektar, senior management analyst with Alameda County's Early Care and Education Planning Council.

0," New Zealand-based research organization AgResearch has abandoned its 13-year animal cloning research program after it proved to be an abysmal failure. A company report states that 'only 10 percent of the cloned animals survived through the research trials,' and it also admits that the animals underwent 'unnecessary suffering' in the process. For years, AgResearch has unsuccessfully tried to modify animals to create more milk, grow faster, resist disease, and even unnaturally grow special proteins from genetically-modified animal embryos for use in human drugs. But reports indicate that most of the animals used in its trials experienced severe pain and suffering as a result, while the vast majority of them ended up dying from either spontaneous abortions or hydrops, a condition where a cow's uterus fills with water and results in the mother having to be euthanized. 'The decision was made, enough is enough,' said Jimmy Suttie, General Manager of AgResearch Applied Biotechnologies, concerning the scrapping of the program. Though the statement infers an end to cloning research at AgResearch, the company has other cloning plans in the works. Reports indicate that the company plans to now move forward with another cloning project that involves transgenic technology. And the new research may result in the same or worse results because it uses embryonic stem cells to clone animals -- and virtually all research involving embryonic stem cells, both in humans and animals, has been a complete failure. Like the genetic engineering of plants, animal cloning is chock full of unknowns. Besides the fact that cloning is largely unsuccessful in the first place, consumption of cloned animal products by humans has never been proven to be safe. Nevertheless, regulatory bodies both in the US and abroad have carelessly allowed cloned foods to slip into the food supply, endangering the health of untold numbers of people ( http://www.selfnews.com/029411_cloned_bee... ).

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) These days, most food products that are specifically marketed to children contain tartrazine. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop here. Tartrazine is also found in many medications, cosmetics and personal care products. It is in fact derived from coal tar. Some may not be familiar with what coal tar actually is or where it originates from. The online dictionary at www.dictionary.reference.com refers to coal tar as `a thick, black, viscid liquid formed during the distillation of coal, that upon further distillation yields compounds, as benzene, anthracene, and phenol, from which are derived a large number of dyes, drugs and other synthetic compounds, and that yields a final residuum (coal-tar pitch), which is used chiefly in making pavements.` Tartrazine can also be seen on ingredient labels as FD&C; yellow 5, E102 or C.I. 19140. It is one of a group of dyes known as azo dyes. It is in fact an artificial colouring that is used to make foods and other products more visually appealing or appetizing. It is also used in the printing, textile and paper-manufacturing industries as pH indicators or biological stains. Side-Effects of Tartrazine Time and time again, tartrazine has been proven to cause many different side-effects and allergic reactions in people. These can include: anxiety, migraines, asthma attacks, blurred vision, eczema, other skin rashes, thyroid cancer, Eosinophilia (increase in specific forms of white blood cells), clinical depression, ADHD or hyperactivity, hives, permanent DNA damage, heart palpitations, rhinitis, sleep disturbances/insomnia, general all-over weakness, hot flushes and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). In severe cases, anaphylactic-like reactions to tartrazine have also been reported. It is sometimes even fed to chickens to make their egg yolks more yellow and visually appealing! Studies have also revealed that consuming tartrazine also aggravates and increases the symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (a painful wrist condition which is caused by the compression of the median nerve, which passes between the ligaments and bones in the wrist). The reason for this aggravation is because tartrazine interferes with the metabolism of Vitamin B6 in the body. By eliminating tartrazine from the diet, it is possible to reduce and even prevent the occurrence of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The main reason that tartrazine is used is because of the fact that it is a cheap alternative to beta-carotene, which is 100% natural and beneficial to our health . Turmeric can also be used as an alternative colourant in savoury dishes. Malt and Annatto can also replace this extremely unhealthy additive.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) It's one of the most dreaded problems associated with growing older - memory problems. But dementia and even plain old 'senior moments' don't have to be inevitable with age. Research is mounting that do-it-yourself strategies like continuing to challenge your brain by learning new things and exercise can help preserve your cognition as you age. Now scientists have found that a delicious natural drink can actually improve memory in older adults who have already experienced early memory decline. The brain power booster isn't anything exotic or rare, either - it is Concord grape juice. A ground-breaking pilot study, led by Robert Krikorian, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, was recently presented at the 38th annual scientific meeting of the American Aging Society in Boulder, Colorado. Dr. Krikorian and his research team gave 12 adults with early memory decline a total of 15 to 21 ounces of Concord grape juice or placebo daily (the amount varied depending on body weight) for 12 weeks. This was the first placebo-controlled human study to investigate whether regular consumption of a polyphenol-rich food or beverage such as grape juice could positively impact age-related cognitive decline. Polyphenols are found in a wide variety of phytonutrient-containing food, including grapes, and are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous research has linked them to combating oxidative stress and suggested they could hold the key to preventing cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The study participants who drank the Concord grape juice were found to have significant improvements when given learning tests. The researchers concluded this suggests a measurable improvement in short-term memory retention - so adding Concord grape juice in the diet may provide benefit for older adults with early memory decline. The evidence that a diet including phytonutrient-rich fruits, vegetables and juices may help slow and possibly even reverse age-related mental declines is especially good news for America's aging Baby Boomer population. The number of people 65 years of age and older will double to 70 million by 2030 and cases of age-related cognitive decline as well as dementia from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes are expected to soar. In fact, a Duke University study published early this year in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that 22 percent over age 70 have mild cognitive problems and the National Institutes of Health estimates up to 4.5 million Americans have AD. 'A simple, easy-to-incorporate dietary intervention that could improve or protect memory function, such as drinking Concord grape juice daily, may be beneficial for the aging population. These results with Concord grape juice are very encouraging and certainly warrant additional study,' Dr. Krikorian stated in a prepared statement for the media.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The bird flu has struck South Korea after three years of little to no activity. The H5N1 virus is a highly virulent strain that could potentially spread to and kill humans. South Korea's Agriculture Ministry said earlier this week it suspected bird flu had killed 6,000 chickens at a farm in the southwest of the country that lies on a path for migratory birds. A Ministry official said 'It is the H5N1 strain' after seeing test results from the suspected case. After the results were reported, the Agriculture Ministry ordered the culling of 236,000 poultry within a 1,640-foot radius of the farm in South Korea's North Cholla province, which is located about 100 miles from Seoul. In addition, quarantine authorities also banned the shipment of more than 5 million poultry from 221 farms within a 6.2-mile radius of the farm. No signs of human infection had been spotted or reported among local residents or quarantine officials, according to another Agriculture Ministry official. Between December 2003 and March 2004 -- about 400,000 poultry at South Korean farms were infected by bird flu. That recent history has caused concern on this latest case, because during the outbreak from 2003, South Korea culled 5.3 million birds -- and spent about $1.6 billion on preventing the disease from spreading. After the 2003 South Korean outbreak, tests in the U.S. indicated that at least nine South Korean workers involved in the cull had been infected with the H5N1 virus. However, none of the infected workers developed major illnesses. Since 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in around 50 countries and territories around the globe. The World Health Organization said that by Nov. 13 of this year, there had been 258 cases of human infection of the H5N1 strain since 2003, resulting in 153 deaths. Many of the H5N1 victims were in Asia, with 98 deaths in Vietnam and Indonesia. ### "
0," Tweet There is a long history of discovering relationships between nutritional deficiencies and chronic disease. One of the most well known is probably scurvy -- a disease where your bones lose their rigidity due to a deficiency of vitamin C. The historical accounts of this mostly involve sailors who, on long sailing voyages, were overcome by this nutritional disease. And it actually took hundreds of years before the right scientist came along and discovered that this was caused by a simple nutritional deficiency that could be cured by eating fruits high in vitamin C such as limes. Hence the name 'limeys' for sailors. That's just one example of a disease caused by nutritional deficiencies. There are many other diseases such as rickets and beriberi caused by nutritional deficiencies. Asian people who historically ate polished, processed rice (white rice) frequently got beriberi, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamin). Until the nutritional causes of beriberi were established, however, physicians of ancient Asia thought the disease was some sort of plague. In America, the term 'redneck' actually comes from a vitamin B deficiency that caused heightened susceptibility to sunburns. Interestingly, most Americans are, today, deficient in B vitamins as well, making them technically rednecks. It also explains why many people are so easily sunburned. As explained in Staying Healthy With Nutrition by Dr. Elson Haas, M.D.: For a long period of history, the niacin deficiency disease, pellagra, was a very serious and fatal problem. Characterized as the disease of the 'three Ds,' pellagra causes its victims to experience dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The fourth D was death. As described previously, the classic B3 deficiency occurs mainly in cultures whose diets rely heavily on corn and where the corn is not prepared in a way that releases its niacin. One of the first signs of pellagra, or niacin deficiency, is the skin's sensitivity to light, and the skin becomes rough, thick, and dry (pellagra means 'skin that is rough' in Italian). The skin then becomes darkly pigmented, especially in areas of the body prone to be hot and sweaty or those exposed to sun. The first stage of this condition is extreme redness and sensitivity of those exposed areas, and it was from this symptom that the term 'redneck,' describing the bright red necks of eighteenth-and nineteenth-century niacin-deficient fieldworkers, came into being. The early colonial settlers in America, by the way, didnt know how to properly process corn as the American Indians did. The American Indians processed corn using potash (which is highly alkaline) that makes the B vitamins in corn available for assimilation during digestion. But the American settlers, not understanding how to prepare corn, would simply grind up their corn and consume it as corn flour (corn meal). By the way, that's how most people eat corn today: as ground up cornmeal ingredients in chips and foods. In more modern times, we know very well about what happens when you're deficient in folic acid and you are a pregnant woman: your baby may be born with serious spinal cord defects or even be stillborn. In fact, birth defects are almost always explained by nutritional deficiencies or the consumption of foods and beverages by the mother that interfere with good nutrition. We also know that iodine is absolutely essential for human health, which is why salt is enriched with iodine. That's in an effort to prevent goiter, a disease that was quite common in the United States until iodine was finally mandated as a salt supplement (enrichment) by the FDA. As a nation we have managed to force a handful of minerals and vitamins into the food supply that prevent only the most grotesque and physically obvious disorders and diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies. And by the way, those are the only ones that really get addressed through the food supply. If there is an obvious and immediate link between nutrition and a particular disease such as birth defects caused by a lack of folic acid, then of course this gets recognized and addressed very quickly. But other metabolic disorders such as cancer and diabetes are more complex and so the cause/effect relationship is not so easy to see from the point of view of scientists, the FDA, and even the public. So these don't get addressed. And that, frankly, is why the public is still not being taught the correlation between nutrition and chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis and even mental disorders like clinical depression. This article is an excerpt from the book, The 7 Laws of Nutrition by Mike Adams. "
0," A recent survey of hospitals found that infections, surgical errors and other medical harm contribute to the deaths of about 180,000 patients a year. The projections by Consumer Reports magazine were based on a 2010 report by the Department of Health and Human Resources. In addition to the deaths, the government report found that another 1.4 million patients are seriously hurt by their hospital care. What is most interesting about these results is that they cover just a small sample; the figures pertain only to Medicare patients. What happens to other patients is less clear, the magazine said, because most hospital errors don't get reported and hospitals only report a small fraction of what can go wrong. 'There is an epidemic of health-care harm,' Rosemary Gibson, a patient-safety advocate and author, said. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves' She adds that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.25 million Americans will probably die from medical harm this decade. 'That's like wiping out the entire populations of North Dakota, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's a man-made disaster,' she said. Some hospitals are responding to this crisis by implementing new safety measures such as electronically prescribing medications to help prevent drug errors and checklists to prevent infections - with some success. Since 2008, rates of central-line bloodstream infections, for instance, have fallen off by 32 percent, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That's a start, but much more needs to be done, industry experts say. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves,' notes Peter Pronovost, M.D., senior VP for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. The government hasn't made it a priority either, he added. 'Medical harm is probably one of the three leading causes of death in the U.S., but the government doesn't adequately track it as it does deaths from automobiles, plane crashes, and cancer. It's appalling,' he told the magazine. The dearth of information, he says, not only makes it harder to identify and define the extent of the problem but also creates challenges for patients who are trying to learn more about the safety of hospitals in their communities. That's where Consumer Reports stepped up. For the first time, in August 2012, the magazine rated hospitals for safety, utilizing the most current data available. The analysis includes data from both government and independent sources on 1,159 hospitals in 44 states. For their report, the magazine said it 'also interviewed patients, physicians, hospital administrators, and safety experts; reviewed medical literature; and looked at hospital inspections and investigations.' That said, the ratings still only include 18 percent of U.S. hospitals because data on patient harm is still not fully reported or available consistently nationwide. 'Hospitals that volunteer safety information, regardless of their score, deserve credit, since the first step in safety is accountability,' John Santa, M.D., director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center , said. 'But the fact that consumers can't get a full picture of most hospitals in the U.S. underscores the need for more public reporting.' All hospitals have something bad about them To make its determinations, the magazine focused on six things: infections, readmissions, communication, CT scanning, complications, and mortality. Not all health professionals agreed with the ratings scheme. Readmission rates, for instance, could be higher among hospitals care for patients who then have little home or community support after being discharged. Some of the most important findings include: -- There are bad things that happen in all hospitals. But the difference is, in terms of ratings, bad things happen in some hospitals more often than others. Consumer Reports said: 'The lowest--scoring hospital, Sacred Heart Hospital in Chicago, earned just a 16 on our 100-point safety scale and reported a rate of bloodstream -infections that was more than twice the national benchmark. The hospital declined to comment.' -- Even hospitals with high ratings/scores can do better. The Billings Clinic in Montana was at the top of the magazine's safety ratings list, but it only got a 72 (out of a possible 100). -- Some well-known hospitals have less-than-stellar safety scores (including Massachusetts General in Boston and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles). The American Association of Justice - formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America - says preventable medical errors are the sixth-biggest killer in the country.

0," Cancer. Heart disease. High blood pressure. Obesity. Diabetes. Premature aging. What we take for granted as hallmarks of life in the most affluent country on Earth have been popularly linked to everything from genetics to fast food. What if the real answer is so straightforward it's as near at hand as the closest bottle of Coke? Mounting research pinpoints both cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as definitive agents in all of the 'epidemics' this generation has become painfully familiar with. Insulin resistance, heart disease and diabetes The link between sugar consumption and diabetes is common knowledge: the pancreas secretes insulin to lower blood sugar after eating, and simple sugars like cane sugar and HFCS cause blood sugar to skyrocket, requiring the pancreas to pump out more insulin. If the pancreas becomes exhausted from dealing with chronically high sugar consumption, blood sugar can spiral to dangerous levels - this is diabetes. Less familiar is the condition of insulin resistance, where cells become less responsive to the action of insulin, requiring the pancreas to continually amp up the amount of insulin it produces. This may or may not trigger diabetes, but regardless, the end result is the liver's conversion of these sugars into a saturated fatty acid known as palmitate. Palmitate raises LDL cholesterol (the bad kind), leading to heart disease. Experts say that metabolic syndrome is now the most prominent factor in heart attacks. Insulin resistance, also known as metabolic syndrome, is thought to be present in 75 million Americans, and is usually connected to the accumulation of fat around the gut. Amazingly, insulin resistance can be induced in test animals in as little a week if they're given diets with 60 or 70 percent of calories from sugar. Fortunately, when their diets were de-sweetened, the insulin resistance likewise disappeared. Sugar's role in feeding cancer As the World Health Organization concluded in 2004, people who are obese, diabetic or have metabolic syndrome are all at a higher risk of developing cancer than those who aren't. The problem is metabolic syndrome itself; researchers believe a large percentage of cancers - up to 80 - are fueled by the effect of insulin on the cancer cells, and the chronically high insulin levels of those with metabolic syndrome means more fuel for the fire. In fact, tumors usually develop mutations to more effectively use insulin for growth. This is especially true for breast and colon cancer. Sugar and premature aging Finally, one of sugar's least well-known crimes is its central role in skin aging. In short, if a person consumes excess sugar, those sugars will attach to proteins in the blood stream, creating what are known as advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. AGEs damage adjacent proteins, and collagen happens to be the most available protein in the body. Effected collagen becomes dry and brittle rather than supple and springy, and wrinkled, sagging skin is the result. The more sugar consumed, the faster skin aging occurs. The Verdict With such a daunting rap sheet, it's no wonder that some researchers studying the effects of cane sugar and HFCS are spooked off these substances altogether. The question is no longer how much sucrose or fructose in the diet is healthy, but whether added sugar should be consumed at all. Robert Lustig, an expert in childhood obesity, doesn't hesitate to label sugar as 'toxic' and 'evil.' Rather than having sugar evoke fond memories of lemonade and apple pie, we would all be better off to do the same. "
0," President Obama's second term thus far has been consumed in scandal, including new revelations that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has, for years, targeted key conservative constituencies including Tea Party-related organizations for political considerations. But in addition to conservative and Constitution-centric organizations, IRS officials have also targeted key Jewish groups, also for the same reason, National Review magazine and other media outlets have reported. On Friday, May 10, Lois Lerner, the IRS official in charge of the division that handles non-profit groups, admitted that her agency was indeed targeting conservative groups and apologized. 'That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review,' she said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association. 'The IRS would like to apologize for that.' Apparently, according to reports, IRS officials within the non-profit division were singling out entities that used the terms 'tea party' or 'patriot' within their organizational name on their tax-exempt forms. Jewish groups also being targeted? U.S. lawmakers - especially Republicans - are furious at the IRS for targeting such organizations, but what about those affiliated with the Jewish faith? That's a question lawmakers ought to ask the agency as well, according to the Jewish Press : While they are at it, the committee might want to ask the IRS whether their list of targets extended beyond political party discrimination. There is evidence the IRS also targeted pro-Israel groups whose positions were potentially inconsistent with the administration's. For example, in 2010, the passionately pro-Israel organization Z STREET filed a lawsuit against the IRS, claiming it had been told by an IRS agent that because the organization was 'connected to Israel,' its application for tax-exempt status would receive additional scrutiny. This admission was made in response to a query about the lengthy review of Z STREET's tax exempt status application. In addition, the IRS agent told a Z STREET representative that the applications of some of those Israel-related organizations have been assigned to 'a special unit in the D.C. office to determine whether the organization's activities contradict the Administration's public policies.' And at least one purely religious Jewish organization, one not focused on Israel, was the recipient of bizarre and highly inappropriate questions about Israel. Those questions also came from the same non-profit division of the IRS at issue for inappropriately targeting politically conservative groups. The IRS required that Jewish organization to state 'whether [it] supports the existence of the land of Israel,' and also demanded the organization '[d]escribe [its] religious belief system toward the land of Israel.' The pro-Israel lobbying organization, in its suit, claimed the IRS activity amounts to viewpoint discrimination - a constitutional violation of free speech provisions contained within the First Amendment. Among other things, Z STREET is seeking complete public disclosure of the origin, development, approval, substance and application of the IRS policy stating pro-Israel organizations must be treated differently than other groups. More to the story For years the nation's tax agency has not only denied it targeted Z STREET for inappropriate scrutiny but has also prevented the lobbying group from pursuing claims of discrimination, Jewish Press reported. Z STREET additionally claims that the IRS took the actions it did because Israel is a country 'where terrorism happens,' and because of that the agency was justified in taking more time to see if the organization was ever involved with terrorist funding. 'Z STREET is a purely educational organization and has never funded anything, either in Israel or anywhere else,' the Jewish Press said. Regarding the 'snafu' with conservative groups, Lerner said the issue originated from an IRS office in Cincinnati, though she would not say which one. But there is more to that story, per National Review : The same branch of the IRS, dealing with such applications, also came under criticism last year when confidential tax documents filed by American Crossroads , the nonprofit organization associated with Karl Rove, were illegally leaked to the media and published by ProPublica , the nonprofit project funded in part by George Soros's Open Society Foundations . No one has been charged in that crime. Sounds like President Obama's IRS doesn't much care for his political opponents. "
0," In a naked attempt to shred the Constitution's privacy and due process provisions, drug warriors are pursuing a new avenue of prosecution: Testing your sewage waste to see if you've been naughty or nice when it comes to using a drug Uncle Sam has deemed illegal. What's worse, there are actually some who are serving as cheerleaders for all of this. According to a news release from the American Chemical Society : 'The war on drugs could get a boost with a new method that analyzes sewage to track levels of illicit drug use in local communities in real time. The new study, a first-of-its-kind in the U.S., was published in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology and could help law enforcement identify new drug hot spots and monitor whether anti-drug measures are working .' [emphasis added] Study authors Kurunthachalam Kannan and Bikram Subedi said that, today, most techniques used to estimate drug use in the country are based on surveys, criminal statistics and drug seizures by law enforcement agencies. However, they say that a lot of illicit drug use is occurring that otherwise is not being measured. So, to compensate for that dearth of statistical evidence, the study authors advocate testing wastewater -- sewage -- for evidence of drug use in certain population areas. Can police simply test your waste without a warrant? 'Like a lot of other compounds from pharmaceuticals and personal care products to pesticides, illegal drugs and their metabolic byproducts also persist in sewage,' the ACS news release said. 'In Europe, a number of studies have been done to see how well wastewater treatment plants are removing illicit drugs from sludge before treated water is released into the environment. But until now, no study in the U.S. had looked at this, likely leading to underestimates of abuse.' To gather data for their study -- which was funded in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- Kannan and Subedi examined illegal drug levels at two wastewater treatment plants in Albany, New York. The scientists reported finding cocaine in 93 percent of all untreated samples. In addition, they reported finding levels of byproducts from opioids and hallucinogenic drugs as well, concluding that wastewater treatment facilities were not removing all illicit drugs before releasing the water back into the environment, which would then eventually wind up in some drinking water. 'But, the researchers suggest, tracking drugs in wastewater could help policymakers and law enforcement understand patterns of abuse and better fight it,' said the ACS press release. Justin Gardner of The Free Thought Project says such law enforcement monitoring is inherently unjust. Do you have a right to biological privacy? 'The thought of authorities slogging through the sludge may be comical, but it represents another example of big brother using our money to monitor our behavior,' he wrote at TheFreeThoughtProject.com . 'Drug consumption is a non-violent act upon oneself. The drug trade is made violent in a black market under government prohibition.' Many libertarians feel the same; they believe that drug enforcement and prohibition merely enables government to exert power and influence in a realm of human activity that does not inherently affect other human beings -- only those engaging in the activity. That may be true to an extent, but there are larger issues here as well -- constitutional issues. Will police or federal agencies be required to obtain a search warrant before testing sewage? Or will this monitoring be permitted in the name of public safety ? Does a person have a right to biological privacy , and if so, does that right to biological privacy exist only in the moments before you flush your toilet? How about if you go to the bathroom outside? All good questions, to which there are -- so far -- no answers. Sources: http://thefreethoughtproject.com http://pubs.acs.org http://www.acs.org "
0," Individual liberty is being burned at the stake, as governments set fire to people natural rights. This time it has everything to do with homeschooling. It all started in Germany. Uwe and Hannelore Romeike were raising their five children in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, when they decided to remove their children from the public education system. In 2006, the Romeike's illegally withdrew their children from the German public schools system and began homeschooling. Believing that the public education system was undermining their Christian faith, the Romeike's began breaking the law and teaching their kids at home. By exercising their natural rights, the Romeikes were fined over $10,000 by the German government and at one point their children were forcefully removed from their home. In 2010, after getting their children back, they chose to flee Germany and move to the United States. Finding freedom in the US, only to be challenged again, this time by the US Upon arrival in Tennessee, the Romeikes were granted asylum. A federal judge rebuked the German policy and ruled that the Romeike's had a reasonable fear of persecution for their personal beliefs if they returned to Germany. Nothing much was said about the issue until the Obama's Administration's Department of Justice got involved. Attorney General, Eric Holder came out and opposed the federal court ruling, siding with the German government. He pleaded that the Romeike's be denied their asylum. Holder believes that governments may legitimately use force and authority to make parents comply with government-sanctioned schools. With statements like these, the United States, once a beacon for liberty, is now endorsing force and mandates in regard to education. The right to homeschool and teach one's own children is a fundamental human right is now at stake. It doesn't matter what beliefs each family has. It's liberty that matters. According to Holder, that liberty should be supervised by the federal government. Government supervised education The German policy that's currently in place says that the upbringing of a child is a parent's natural right but the government's duty is to watch over them in the performance of this duty. The law also states that: 'The entire school system shall be under the supervision of the state.' The policy in the United States is currently one of freedom. The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution secures homeschooling as a fundamental liberty. The Constitution enables each individual state to regulate homeschooling in its own way. Is this idea under attack? Very much so. The Attorney General currently seeks to deport the Romeike's. Their right to home school their children their own way doesn't matter to the Department of Justice. The government is more concerned with compliance: Everyone giving away their liberty and free will, and absorbing the education laid out by federal law. From the failed No Child Left Behind Act to the new federally implemented Common Core program, the government is socializing the public school system. The new Common Core program is based on a one-size-fits-all approach that school Board President Michael Faccinetto condemns, saying: 'All we care about are these high-stakes tests and numbers and data instead of the kids.' Faccinetto continues, 'Standardized tests don't define the success of a child.' Homeschooling typically allows for a broader, more creative, and more self-disciplined approach to learning Will federal compliance be the way forward for education in the United States, or are people catching on and learning that the freedom of homeschooling allows for the exploration of alternative ideas, engaging children more effectively with their society and themselves? Indeed, homeschooling in the US is on the rise. Since 1999, the number of homeschooled children has increased by 75 percent. Typically, a parent-involved education lays the groundwork for a set of core values that helps children become more productive and principled later in life. More times than not, homeschooling is not a close-minded, antisocial way of educating. It's actually a more integrative, creative approach, with opportunities outside the classroom. Homeschooling isn't anything to be ashamed of, and there should be nothing criminal about it. It is a parent's natural right to teach their children what they want as long as they are not harming another. A family that flees a county's educational control to find liberty in the United States is a testimony of freedom and the Attorney General should be ashamed for wanting to strip the family of asylum and deport them back into the hands of the controlling German government.

0," As many areas of the country perspire their way through record-breaking summer heat, staying hydrated is of the essence, as is keeping your body nourished with life-giving, health-promoting superfoods. And since warm and hot foods are not always desirable during this time of year, here are a few 'cool' superfood ideas to help you beat the heat and nurture your palate. Cucumbers - Fibrous and mostly composed of water, the cucumber is one of the most effective 'cooling' foods as its juice helps to lower body temperature. Cucumber seeds also contain cucurbitin, an amino acid, linoleic acid, and various other fatty acids that soothe the body both internally and externally. Try slicing some cucumbers for breakfast, or making a cucumber sandwich for lunch -- you might be surprised at how healthy you feel. Melons - Gently sweet and refreshingly succulent, watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe are among the most popular summertime melons. Each one is composed of roughly 95 percent water, and about five percent natural fruit sugar. Melons are also rich in varying levels of vital enzymes, vitamins and minerals, and electrolytes, which make them an ideal food for replenishing the water and nutrients lost while sweating on those hot summer days. Strawberries - An iconic summertime treat, the strawberry is refreshing, nutritious, and delicious. The fruit, which is a member of the rose family, is high in vitamin C, the trace mineral manganese, antioxidants, and various other nutrients and enzymes that promote good health . Just be sure to buy pesticide-free or organic strawberries rather than conventional, as the latter tend to be among the most toxic when it comes to chemical contamination. Radishes - You may not necessarily think of them as an ideal summertime treat, but radishes are actually an excellent addition to your healthy, summertime diet. A powerful cleansing vegetable, the radish is both pungent and sweet, depending on the variety, and can be eaten raw, or added to salads or gazpachos. You can also throw some radishes into a pilaf or cucumber salad for a tasty, filling snack that will help stimulate healthy digestion and promote healthy liver and gallbladder function. Mint - There are so many unique ways to use mint, particularly when it comes to summertime beverages and light fare, that a quick snippet on this healing herb hardly does it justice. But it is worth mentioning, as mint can be added to tea, lemonade, vegetables salads, marinades, smoothies, sorbets, and cocktails. Rich in fiber, iron, copper, calcium, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acid concentrates, mint not only livens up food and beverages, but it also calms intestinal inflammation and fights harmful bacteria. Chia seeds - Popularized by the well-known television infomercial for the pet by the same name, chia is a hydrating, rejuvenating, and lubricating superfood seed that provides lasting energy and sustained vigor, even during the heat of the day. Try adding soaked or gelled chia seeds to things like smoothies, juices, breakfast cereals, and salads to up your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, and ease inflammation throughout your body. "
0," Quietly, but steadily, there is a major military build-up occurring in police departments all over the country, and as the nation winds down its wars overseas, chances are good that even more military gear will find its way into local precincts. selfnews has reported on this worrisome phenomenon in the past; some organizations, like the ACLU, have also been monitoring this military build-up. But as the transfers of military gear to local departments continues, coverage into the issue has been expanding. As reported recently by NewsChannel 5 in Nashville, what is taking place with one local Tennessee department is emblematic of what is occurring all over the country. Besides departments taking possession of massive armored vehicles once used to patrol the streets and routes in Afghanistan and Iraq, they are also being provided weapons like assault rifles and even grenade launchers, all of which have been deemed to be surplus by the Pentagon. More like small armies The equipment is plentiful and as such is cheap for local law enforcement agencies to purchase. Some of it is even provided free of charge. The program has increasingly caused a stir and debate about the continued militarization of the nation's police departments. In McMinn County, Tennessee, located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, there is beautiful scenery and a peaceful, serene countryside. But its sheriff's department is getting armed to the teeth. This year, the department has received more military surplus firearms than any other local department in the state. 'We actually reconfigured the whole armory to accommodate all of this,' said Sheriff Joe Guy. The sheriff oversees 31 officers and investigators, but his department nevertheless has received 161 army rifles and pistols, including 41 M-16s and 71 .45 caliber handguns. When asked by NewsChannel 5 why the department needed so many weapons, Guy answered: 'Well, we don't need this many. There was a little error in the order.' Guy said the U.S. Army's surplus program doubled his initial order, but nevertheless he has not yet sent the weapons back. 'They're here as our department grows,' he said. 'We'll have additional firearms for future officers.' McMinn County is not alone. An investigation by the local TV news station found that thousands of pieces of military equipment are going to state law enforcement agencies, much of it equipment used in fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'The way this stuff is being distributed, it's kind of reckless,' said author Radley Balko. Balko is the author of Rise of the Warrior Cop , a book that raises concerns about the militarization of American police departments. 'What we've seen is just a massive transfer of gear, guns, vehicles and other weaponry,' Balko told NewsCenter 5 . The process is nearly automatic. Law enforcement agencies can visit a website that is administered by the Department of Defense and shop around for used equipment. As noted by the local news station: On the day we went to McMinn County, the department was looking for Humvees. Sheriff Guy reviewed what was available. 'It looks good,' Sheriff Guy said to an employee who was looking up a vehicle on-line. The employee responded, 'It's got 14-hundred miles on it.' 'How many of those did you put in for?' Sheriff Guy asked. 'Three,' his employee answered. Sheriff Guy responded, 'Three of those and one truck.' 'We've encouraged police to become more like the military' Police departments are required to pay a registration fee, and then most of the equipment is free, with departments paying for transportation and all maintenance. 'The disbursement across the country is so uneven and random and sort of based on who is good at manipulating the system,' Balko said. The local news station said that 30 Tennessee departments have recently received MRAPs -- mine-resistant, ambush protected -- vehicles which were designed to protect American forces from roadside bombs. 'This is our newest armored protective vehicle,' said Mike Justice with Lebanon Public Safety, adding that he hoped Lebanon police officers never use it. 'The situations we would use this vehicle in is hostage negotiations, putting this vehicle between the bad guy and the good guys.' Balko is concerned. 'What we've done is encourage the police to become more like the military,' Balko said. 'When you surround yourself with the weapons of war, with the language of war, you're going to be much less likely to look for ways of resolving disputes using the least amount of force possible.'

0," Historically, the local county sheriff has been considered to be the highest authority in the land, wielding more power than city, state and even federal authorities. In Delaware; however, that power is under attack, according to one of the state's three county authorities. Sheriff Jeffrey Christopher says when he was elected to office in 2010, he believed he was supposed to represent his constituents as the highest-ranking law enforcement authority in the county. Instead, he has landed smack dab in the middle of a battle for the future of an American law enforcement precedent dating back to the founding of the nation, the American Free Press reported. 'It is one more example of federal and state governments ignoring the will of the people as well state laws. In the case of Delaware, the state's own constitution stipulates that the office of the sheriff is a constitutionally created position just like the secretary of state and the attorney general,' the web publication reported. 'Delaware's Constitution states: 'The sheriffs shall be conservators of the peace within the counties . . . in which they reside.'' 'The others won't stand up with me' The Delaware initiative is being headed by state Attorney General Beau Biden, who is, perhaps not so ironically, the son of Vice President Joe Biden. The report said Biden's office has sent out mandates to county commissioners informing them their sheriffs no longer have powers of arrest. Moreover, AFP said, the position of Biden's office has been seconded by State Solicitor L.W. Lewis, who said in an opinion released a year ago that neither state nor common law grants arrest powers to local county sheriffs . In reality; however, the office of the sheriff was created in the American colonies well before the nation's official founding. In fact, AFP said, Delaware's first sheriff held office in 1669. In a January 2012 interview, Christopher told AFP that the two prior sheriff administrations, dating back as far as 2000, both noticed reductions in funding and the erosion of their offices in general. 'Now my deputies and I have been relieved of all arrest powers and can't even make a traffic stop,' he said. ' Delaware has only three counties. . . The other two sheriffs...will not stand up with me' to prevent the elimination of county law enforcement, Christopher added. The sheriff said the lack of authority vested in his office really came to light during an incident involving a county councilman, Vance Phillips. Christopher said he was struck in the eye and kicked by the councilman but could not arrest him. Bumping off another uniquely American precedent 'I want to recreate the office in the way it was intended,' Christopher, a Republican, told The Huffington Post . 'A sheriff is supposed to be out there responding to the wishes of the people, just as the police do. Most people want to see more of a presence of law enforcement.' Delaware sheriffs traditionally conduct foreclosure sales and deliver court papers, local TV affiliate WBOC reported. While Christopher says his bid to increase the power of his office is rooted in the state's constitution, opponents say he is misinterpreting the phrase. Nevertheless, HuffPo said Christopher has allowed his deputies to chase down felons and other criminals. 'He continues to say he's law enforcement, and he's not,' says state House Majority Leader Pete Schwartzkopf, a Democrat, who introduced a bill last year specifically denying sheriffs the ability to arrest suspects and investigate crimes. 'It's not a good position to be in, to have no authority over a person who carries a gun. It's scary.' Actually, what's truly 'scary' is that yet another uniquely American precedent is being steamrollered by statist politicians who have empowered themselves to do so.

0," A well-known mainstream media dinosaur has been caught yet again spreading lies about the supposed 'benefits' of Obamacare, this time claiming that individual health insurance premiums will drop by up to half once the mandate comes into full effect. But the deceptive report, which appeared recently in The New York Times (NYT), has already been exposed as a complete fraud with fabricated numbers, false price comparisons, and flat-out lies that make it seem as though health insurance rates will drop for everyone when they most definitely will not. The truth of the matter is that health insurance premiums will only drop for some people who live in a select few areas where insurance rates are already insanely high, such as in New York City where policies enacted back in the early 1990s caused individual health insurance plans to skyrocket to unsustainably high levels. Yes, in those areas, average health insurance premiums will likely drop some as a result of Obamacare because they are currently unrealistically high. But for everyone else in New York state, and throughout the rest of the country for that matter, premiums will rise dramatically because of Obamacare. In case you missed the story, the NYT recently ran a front-page piece praising Obamacare as the solution to the years-old problem of high insurance premiums in New York. The expected new rates for 2014 under Obamacare, which were recently approved by insurance regulators, will reportedly be as much as 50 percent lower than current premiums -- the NYT claims health insurance premiums are currently as high as $1,000 per month for individuals in New York City. New Yorkers currently pay high health insurance premiums because of Obamacare-esque policies enacted back in 1992 As good as this might sound, however, the same NYT piece fails to explain to its readers why insurance premiums are currently as high as they are in New York City. According to Avik Roy from the National Review , who recently investigated the paper's claims further, policies enacted back in 1992 by former New York Governor Mario Cuomo are the reason why health insurance premiums are high for New Yorkers -- and believe it or not, these policies very closely resemble those now being forced on the entire U.S. through Obamacare . 'In July of [1992], Gov. Cuomo signed into law the most draconian health insurance regulations drafted in recent times,' writes Roy in his detailed analysis, which was published by Forbes . 'Within four years, these changes resulted in a mass exodus of health insurers from the individual market ... Only the sickest people, who need the insurance , stay in the pool, leading prices to go up and up in an adverse selection death spiral.' So naturally, any new policy that brings back all the people who left the insurance market due to Cuomo's insane healthcare policies -- in this case, the Obamacare individual mandate -- is going to drive prices back down some, which is what the NYT is hyping as 'evidence' that Obamacare will be beneficial for New Yorkers. But the NYT piece fails to explain that health insurance premiums were far lower for New Yorkers prior to Cuomo's policies , and that they will still be higher, on average, under Obamacare . The piece also fails to evaluate how Obamacare will affect almost every other state in the country, nearly all of which currently have far lower premiums than what New Yorkers pay. 'In the vast majority of states, Obamacare has the net effect of raising premiums by a lot, which has given rise to the term 'rate shock,'' adds Roy. 'In California, for example, a healthy 40-year-old today can pay $94 per month in the individual market; that rises to $234 a month under Obamacare: an increase of 149 percent.' Be sure to read Roy's full analysis here to avoid being hoodwinked by the lies of the NYT and the Obama administration concerning Obamacare: http://www.forbes.com "
0," Summer isn't even over yet and the big push for the mass vaccination of the entire population is already under way. The CDC started the push by recently urging vaccine shots for everyone -- including infants, pregnant women and immune-compromised people. Adding to the vaccination hoopla, Walgreens has announced something quite bizarre: A flu shot gift card. Available for $29.99 at your nearest Walgreens retailer, this gift card is, as Walgreens explains on their website, 'a way to help more Americans stay well throughout the upcoming flu season by giving the gift of a flu shot.' See a full-size picture of this flu shot gift card right here: http://www.selfnews.com/images/Walgreens-... Of course, if you gave your friends the gift of vitamin D supplements , they wouldn't need a flu shot or a jab in the arm with a sharp needle. Vitamin D has been proven again and again to work better than vaccines at preventing influenza ( http://www.selfnews.com/027385_Vitamin_D_... ), yet it remains all but ignored by the conventional medical establishment which just happens to be dominated by the financial interests of vaccine manufacturers (pharma companies). Swine flu again? As Walgreens admits on its own website ( http://news.walgreens.com/article_display.cf... ), this year's seasonal flu shot only protects against last year's viruses. In particular, this year's flu shot contains DNA fragments from H1N1 swine flu -- yep, the very same virus that fizzled out last year after the WHO hilariously declared a stage six global pandemic. This whole charade turned out to be engineered by WHO advisors who had financial ties to the vaccine companies ( http://www.selfnews.com/029441_vaccine_ma... ). Now they're trying to jab you again with the same viral fragments. But this year they're playing mind games with the public by packaging these flu shots as 'gifts.' Walgreens must think this is clever, but it's actually a bit of a farce. Usually a gift is something you actually want; something that's uplifting or health enhancing in some way. Vaccines, on the other hand, have been widely linked to convulsions and neurological disorders. Just recently, Australia actually banned its seasonal flu vaccine for children after dozens of children went into convulsions from receiving the flu shot . Why do flu shots cause convulsions? Because flu shots contain neurological inflammation agents designed to elicit an immune response for building antibodies. The problem is that these chemicals can also cause neurological damage leading to symptoms you just can't ignore... such as convulsions. Some teens have even been paralyzed by flu shots. Western doctors routinely ignore this evidence and simply declare vaccines to be 'safe for everyone!' even when they clearly aren't. So anyone who buys a flu shot gift card and hands it to a child or teenager might actually be giving the gift of convulsions . Happy Birthday, Bobby! Here, have some convulsions and go get yourself jabbed in the arm with a sharp needle... Sending the wrong message In my opinion, buying a Walgreens flu shot gift card sends a powerful, two-part message. First, it announces that you're a complete idiot when it comes to health, and you're a total sucker for the corporate-controlled interventionist health care system that excels at convincing you to buy dangerous drugs you don't even need. Secondly, it says that you probably hate the person you're giving it to. What kind of person buys a vaccine shot as a gift anyway? Does it include a Hallmark card that says 'Every time I think of you, I wince in pain and can't stop convulsing. Enjoy this vaccine so that you can have the same experience.' Or another card, 'I couldn't decide what to get you for Christmas, so I thought I'd get you vaccinated instead. Merry Christmas!' Can you imagine some little kid receiving this gift from his parents? He was hoping for an X-Box or a dirt bike, but instead he gets an envelope with a red card in it. 'What's this?' he asks his parents. 'Oh, Bobby, it's a VACCINE gift card! To protect your health!' Bobby replies, 'How does it work?' And his parents answer, 'Well, using this vaccine gift card, you can get jabbed in the arm with chemicals and live viruses, and it won't even cost you a penny!' 'I feel really loved,' answers Bobby. 'No one has ever given me the gift of a vaccine shot! When can we go to Walgreens and cash in?' What's next? Chemo Cards! I got to thinking about this: If flu shot gift cards are so popular, why not just expand this into all the toxic chemicals of modern medicine? Perhaps hospitals should roll out Chemotherapy Gift Cards so you can 'give the gift of chemo!' Is your loved one just a little too healthy? Does their brain work too well? Is their liver annoyingly operating at one hundred percent? Give the gift of chemotherapy and you'll destroy their kidney, liver and brain function (after which they'll gladly accept your flu shot vaccine gift cards next year). The chemo card can act like a coffee punch card, too: After ten rounds of chemotherapy, the eleventh is on the house! (If you're still alive, anyway...) While this idea may seem outlandish today, it's actually not that far-fetched. Flu shot gift cards are already packaging western chemical medicines as 'gifts.' And we just reported a story about how pharma drug pushers want fast food restaurants to hand out statin drugs for free to customers ( http://www.selfnews.com/029467_statin_dru... ). It seems that the idea of repackaging interventionist chemical medicines as gifts is pervasive. It's too bad we can't figure out a way to give the gift of common sense to people. If they had any common sense about health and nutrition, they wouldn't need flu shot gift cards in the first place. "
0," A website designed to draw attention to a new technological development by Internet search giant Google is going viral, thanks in large part to a growing wave of concern over personal privacy. The site, called StopTheCyborgs.org , was established 'in response to the Google Glass project and other technology trends. The aim of the movement is to stop a future in which privacy is impossible and corporate control total,' say developers in a post describing the site's intent. The concept behind Google Glass is an eye wear device that uses Google's virtually limitless bank of data to allow the user to record everything he or she sees, in real time, and then be able to utilize smart phone, Internet and other communication technology to immediately transmit, post or otherwise publicize that content - all without the permission of the subjects who have been videotaped. 'We are already continually tracked though smart phones, online tracking, banking transactions, and CCTV. So why all the fuss about a smart phone on your face?' says StopTheCyborgs . Millions of 'creepy' cameramen Consider these reasons, among many others: -- First of all, Google has the marketing resources and power to make recording of private activity or conversations socially acceptable. 'Would you have even considered wearing a hidden spy camera or recording conversations a few years ago? Well soon everyone will be doing it and finding you odd for objecting,' says the site. For comparison's sake, the site's founders say, check out Seattle's 'Creepy' Cameraman . -- With Google Glass, how are you supposed to know if somebody's recording you ? Keep in mind the very design of the Google device makes it difficult to know. 'This is in contrast to a smart phone where the user must visibly hold the camera up to take a picture or record video. We must therefore assume that we are being recorded at all times (and possibly publicly broadcast) from a low angle where ones face is clearly visible,' the site warned. -- Even if a Google Glass user isn't recording video, audio for their own personal use may still be collected and processed to the cloud, so as to display contextual information using image, object, face, voice identification and speech recognition, which is 'so-called augmented reality,' says the site. -- Information collected about you won't just sit in a database somewhere, to be read only by security services or bored IT workers. Rather, it will be delivered directly to the people you are interacting with - and all without your permission. The last bits of your privacy are about to go away for good 'These concerns go beyond privacy,' warns the site. 'There are serious consequences for human society. There will no longer be any distinction between the 'digital world' and the 'real world.' People will make decisions and interact with other humans in the real world in a way which increasingly depends on information that Google Glass tells them.' Further, people will gradually 'stop acting as autonomous individuals, when making decisions and interacting with others, and instead become mere sensor/effector nodes of a global network. There will be no room for multiple identities, hypocrisy or experimentation. There will be no space in which you can escape your online profile and the system will be controlled by a small group of corporations.' Other concerns regarding Google Glass: -- Such devices could destroy the very last vestiges of privacy Americans - who are already videotaped on the street by cities, in stores and parking lots by businesses, by banks - have left. -- They could hold people accountable for easily pardonable 'offenses.' -- They may increase violations of doctor-patient confidentiality and attorney-client privilege. -- The devices could spawn a whole new generation of stalkers. Privacy in America has been vanishing for years. Google Glass and devices like it will put the final nail into the coffin, leaving your home just about the only place left on the planet where you might have some semblance of privacy (unless you invite someone in who's wearing a pair of Google Glasses).

0," The more you study nutrition, the more you learn about the health benefits of raw nuts. Nuts offer nutritious oils and vitamins (like Vitamin E) that continue to surprise scientists with their ability to support and enhance good health. But the problem with most conventional nuts is that they're either cooked or too boring to eat. Nobody wants to eat boring food, and cooked nuts lose much of their original nutritional value. The LivingNutz company solves both problems at once! They offer a remarkable line of raw, sprouted nuts with amazing flavors using truly natural ingredients. I've been a huge fan of the LivingNutz product line for many years, and Seth Leaf, the founder of LivingNutz, has been a steadfast champion of food freedom and an advocate of natural health. He spoke out quite publicly against the fumigation of California almonds, for example, and has been a big supporter of the raw foods community. Seth has made five fabulous flavors of his LivingNutz product line available to our selfnews Store, and all five are made with simple, healthy and truly natural ingredients. For example, their 'Bodacious Banana Bread Walnutz' product (which is outrageously delicious) has the following five ingredients: Walnutz, Bananas, Agave, Cinnamon, Celtic Sea Salt . And that's it!

Discounts for selfnews readers These LivingNutz packages normally retail for $6.49 each.

Our special saves you 50 cents off the regular price, so you can pick up a bag of any one flavor for $5.95. The best deal, though, comes when you purchase a 5-pack, giving you one bag of each flavor. Our special price on the 5-pack is $27.97, which is about a 14% savings over the regular price. Plus, it lets you sample all five of these delicious flavors! Health Ranger hint: Don't waste these nuts on people who don't know what they're eating. If you have family or friends who can't tell the difference between roasted, MSG-laced peanuts vs. raw, sprouted organic LivingNutz made with world-class ingredients, then don't share these with them! These LivingNutz products are highly valued by those who know how they're made, what's in them, and why they're different from run-of-the-mill 'roasted nuts' products, many of which are just chemically-enhanced dead foods. LivingNutz is for people who recognize superior quality when they taste it. These make an outstanding gift for any food aficionado, vegetarian or health-conscious person who wants to enjoy what might be the most delicious raw nuts available anywhere. The thing is, we have only a limited supply of these right now, and we have no way to get more when these sell out. Usually with other product specials, we can always ask for more from the supplier, and we've done this frequently when previous discounts sold out. But with LivingNutz, because they're hand-made in small batches, we can't get any more for several weeks. So if you'd like to try these, pick up a 5-pack sample assortment today and get ready to enjoy some of the most amazing raw, living nuts you've ever experienced! Click here for the selfnews Store . You'll really enjoy these, and you can eat them guilt-free because the ingredients are truly natural and certified organic. "
0," Babies and toddlers do not eat much food because their tummies are tiny. That is why it is important to feed them foods that are packed with nutrients.

0," -- Healthy adults who took the maximum dose of Tylenol for two weeks were found to have liver damage, according to a study appearing in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Researchers instructed 106 study participants to take 4 grams of Tylenol (eight extra-strength tablets) a day for two weeks, with some taking only Tylenol, and some taking Tylenol combined with an opioid painkiller. The rest of the participants were given a placebo. Nearly 40 percent of the participants taking Tylenol or the Tylenol/opioid combination displayed abnormal liver test results that indicated liver damage, while those taking the placebo showed no damage. The study's co-author, Dr. Neil Kaplowitz of the University of Southern California said, 'I would urge the public not to exceed 4 grams a day. This is a drug that has a rather narrow safety window.' Kaplowitz added that heavy drinkers should not exceed 2 grams a day. Tylenol maker McNeil Consumer & Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it had conducted its own research that tracked high-dose Tylenol users over longer periods than the Kaplowitz study, and found that its product did not lead to liver disease. Kaplowitz and co-author Dr. Paul Watkins of the University of North Carolina were hired by Purdue Pharma, which makes the prescription painkiller OxyContin, to see why people testing a drug containing acetaminophen and the opiate hydrocodone were having abnormal liver tests. Contrary to the researchers' theories, they found that acetaminophen was the culprit. Acetaminophen is Americans' over-the-counter painkiller of choice. Acetaminophen overdose is also the leading cause of acute liver failure. ### "
0," These two luminaries have formed a group called No More Stolen Elections. If Romney wins, they'll challenge any instances of Republican election fraud they can find. They still think there are two political parties in this country. How quaint. And soda fountains still dispense cherry Cokes and milk shakes in metal cans. A twist of licorice is two cents. There was a time, 40 years ago, when the political left in this country stood for No More War and an end to illegal surveillance of private citizens. Millions of people took to the streets to protest the Vietnam war, and thousands exposed the FBI's COINTELPRO program, whereby the DOJ was planting spies and agents in protest groups to push them over the edge into mayhem and violence, so they could be prosecuted. Those objectives are still relevant. The US, under a Democratic president, is engaging in covert and overt military adventures all over the planet. The Obama adminstration is arming terrorists to pose as armies of liberation in the Middle East and Africa. We are still in Afghanistan. The Surveillance State today makes the old COINTEPRO program look like a rag-tag picnic in the park. But the left, including Chomsky and Hayden, is focused on other things. Re-electing Obama at any cost. Giving away more welfare freebies than the current trillion-dollar-a-year programs deliver, while inner cities rot into tombs. Forcibly enrolling all Americans in a national health insurance plan that will bankrupt the already bankrupted government, that will expose millions more people to medical drugs that are already killing at least 100,000 people a year and maiming 30 million. In 1966, a march and rally held in West Los Angeles surrounded the Century Plaza Hotel, where President Lyndon Johnson was staying, and forced LBJ into a box he couldn't escape from. He abandoned his run for reelection in 1968. The left was mercilessly excoriating its own standard bearer, a Democratic president, for his expansion of the war in Vietnam. Today, the notion of the left moving against a Democratic president is unthinkable. Obama could fire missiles at the moon and take out half of it, and the left would find a reason to praise the move. The left has become a know-nothing force that rivals the right. In California, the referendum on GMO labeling of foods has seen a fading of active support from the left. Their stance against murderous big corporations (in this case, Monsanto) has withered. Perhaps this is because their hero, Obama, has become Monsanto's chief lobbyist in Washington. The left rarely mentions this. The left's aborted Occupy protests failed to see through to the implications of what they themselves were pointing at. It was too much for their tired brains. They couldn't and wouldn't equally accuse Clinton, Bush, and Obama for their roles in Grand Theft America. The political left in this country is now all about more freebies, and sometimes they're not even able to articulate that. They fail to recognize or admit that Obama is the equal of Bush when it comes to war-mongering. If Romney wins, he'll bring back the old neocon crowd to replace Obama's new neocon crowd. The federal government will not shrink. Imperial empire will still be on the table. 24/7 surveillance of private citizens will still be the rule. Ditto, if Obama wins. The left in this country is a barnacle hanging on to a bubble of delusion. It can't follow a train of thought, even its own. It can't see that progressivism should mean defecting from and decentralizing central power in all its forms. It can't see that vast expansion of the Welfare State means more mad power for the federal government. It can't see past the end of its own nose. The left is now a quasi-religion based on empty slogans. Even the labor unions in America, once a force for better working conditions, have devolved into a ground-game army to get voters to the polls. Long ago, the private-sector unions sold away their strength to NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT, the WTO, and other death-dealing 'free trade' regulations, with barely a whisper. They sold out their memberships to mega-corporations, and they've been paying the price. The left is now a charade, a shadow play of ghosts. They have no memory of the days when at least a few of their own wanted to crack the egg of centralized political and economic power in America. They don't have the brains or balls for that now. Tom Hayden? Noam Chomsky ? You can put them on a level with George Clooney, Sam Jackson, Madonna, and Alec Baldwin. At best, at the very best, they're all brain-dead amnesia victims. There is one political party in America, and no matter who wins the election today or how much fraud occurs on either side, the mission to forge a better nation will fall, by default, into the hands of people who reject both branches of that one party.

0," Emerging research into a rare kind of fat cell known as brown fat may lead to new medical interventions to fight obesity. Researchers have known for some time of the existence of brown fat in newborn mammals. Unlike the more common white fat, which stores energy, brown fat actually releases energy in order to help heat the body. With the recent discovery that some brown fat cells also exist in adult humans, researchers have begun to wonder whether it might be used to help obese people lose weight. In two studies recently published in the journal Nature , researchers explored the bodily mechanisms that regulate brown fat. In the first, a team of researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston built on its previous finding that a specific gene transcription factor known as PRDM16 helps regulate the activity of brown fat cells. When the researchers removed that transcription factor from immature brown fat cells, the cells immediately turned into muscle. 'What we show in this paper is kind of a big shock,' researcher Bruce Spiegelman said. 'We show that brown fat is derived from a muscle-like cell, and that brown fat and white fat are completely different.' Previously, the same team showed that the addition of PRDM16 could cause white fat cells to turn into brown fat. They are now investigating whether a pharmaceutical drug could be used to stimulate the activity of PRDM16 and encourage the body to make more brown fat. In a second study, researchers from the Joslin Diabetes Center, also in Boston, injected a bone growth protein called BMP-7 into the bodies of mice by means of a virus. The mice that had been injected with BMP-7 subsequently developed more brown fat cells and gained less weight than mice that had not been injected. The same result occurred when researchers transplanted BMP-7-treated immature brown fat cells into adult mice. Sources for this story include: www.reuters.com . "
0," No matter how many times we say, 'I'll never do that again!' when we imbibe in alcohol a little too much, for many there is, sadly, a next time. And a next. And each time, people seem to want to try new and better ways to ease the pain of the inevitable hangover -- techniques that are rooted in legend, old wives' tales and the words of the barroom physician. By the way, the peak of so-called morning after pain occurs at 29 years old, says a recent study from Denmark. Well, to date, there is no 'cure' for the common hangover, though there are some 'treatments,' so to speak. Among them, according to About.com : -- Sleep -- Liquids (because you're dehydrated) like vegetable and fruit drinks coupled with water -- Vitamin C (try some organic orange juice) -- Eat, even if you don't feel like it; mineral- and protein-rich foods are best Now, on to those 'cures' that don't work, as compiled by Men's Health magazine: 'Hair of the dog that bit you' : A morning-after shot of whiskey or Bloody Mary? Well, that may numb your pain, but it's temporary, according to Gary Murray, acting director of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) Division of Metabolism and Health Effects. Taking another drink (or a few more drinks) will only delay the wearing-off effect of your bender. Rehydrating is crucial; alcohol will further dehydrate. Have a greasy breakfast : Think loading up on sausage, eggs and hash browns will help absorb whatever alcohol is left? Nope, because there is no alcohol left by the time you wake up. And in truth, greasy, non-organic, processed food -- besides being incredibly bad for your body -- is likely to accomplish only one thing: giving you heartburn. But again, as stated above, certain foods are better than others. The old standby, coffee : 'There is a cognitive impairment that results from a hangover--a brain fog, which impairs your ability to perform,' Murray says. And while a tad bit of coffee might make you a bit more alert because of the caffeine, coffee is also a major diuretic and, again, you're already badly dehydrated from too much alcohol consumption . Water is better. Have a late-night meal before turning in (wasted) : The theory here is, again, a late-night meal will help absorb the alcohol in your system and therefore ease the pain of getting up in the morning. But in truth, says Murray, 'Eating after you've already been drinking isn't going to help absorb or metabolize the alcohol.' Actually, the trick is to eat a solid meal before you're too many drinks into your evening, because food helps slow the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol, thereby releasing it into your bloodstream at a slower, and far better, rate. Just lie around in bed all day : That isn't effective. Murray told Men's Health , 'studies have shown that the intoxicated go to bed roughly 2 hours later than sober people on the same night.' So, 'fatigue, headache, irritability--these are all symptoms of a hangover , but also of sleep deprivation.' The better option is to grab a couple of more hours of sleep and experience another REM cycle that you likely missed the night before. After that, get up, get around and about and wake yourself up, and Murray says you'll feel much better. Just sweat it out with exercise : Um, you can't really 'sweat it out,' because the culprit -- alcohol -- has already left your system. Still, increasing your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, which is what naturally happens when you exercise, can maybe increase your changes of getting rid of the toxic byproducts. Just pop a couple of painkillers before bed : Not effective. Not only are compounds like aspirin and over-the-counter pain killers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) hazardous in and of themselves and mixed with alcohol, but they can be dangerous even after your body has metabolized the alcohol (which takes about an hour). 'Alcohol turns on specific enzymes in your body that stay present long after you're no longer impaired, even into the next day,' Murray explains. These enzymes can interact dangerously with acetaminophens. The best 'cure'? Avoid over-indulgence in the first place, or, if you didn't, try a natural cure: http://www.selfnews.com .

0," Most politically active Americans are aware of the massive amounts of money spent on political campaigns. And most are also aware that corporate dollars, which fund so-called superPACs (political action committees), give hundreds of millions ever election cycle. In fact, according to a new study by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparent, open government, American corporations spent around $5.8 billion on elections between 2007 and 2012. If that sounds like a big number - and it is - wait until you see what American corporations got in return. Corporate investment in political campaigns pays big dividends According to the foundation, corporations reaped nearly $4.4 trillion in returns for their investments. The foundation looked at 'influence and its potential results on federal decision makers' for six years - three before the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling and three years after the ruling. The study focused on the records of 200 for-profit corporations and companies that had active PACs and lobbyists. 'Their investment was enormous,' the report, titled, 'Fixed Fortunes: Biggest corporate political interests spend billions, get trillions,' said . No, money doesn't influence our system - just ask the Supreme Court 'There were 20,500 paying lobbying clients over the six years we examined; the 200 companies we tracked accounted for a whopping 26 percent of the total spent. On average, their PACs, employees and family members made campaign contributions to 144 sitting members of Congress each [election] cycle,' the report noted. An examination of 14 million records pertaining to campaign contributions, federal budget allocations, lobbying expenditures and other spending found that, on average, 'for every dollar spent on influencing politics, the nation's most politically active corporations received $760 [$4.4 trillion total] from the federal government,' a figure accounting for 'two-thirds of the $6.5 trillion that individual taxpayers paid into the federal treasury.' What's more, as the American middle class shrank dramatically during the same six-year study period, the 200 companies continued getting insane returns on their political investments. They included loans to bail out the automobile industry, the bank bailouts that were 'too big to fail,' federal program expansions that worked to 'help prop up prices for agribusinesses and secure trade deals for our biggest manufacturers,' as well as budget measures 'that funneled extra dollars to everything from defense contractors to public utility companies to financial industry giants.' In addition, researchers found that of some $410 billion in loans issued under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which was created in 2008, nearly 73 percent - or about $298 - went to 16 of the 200 corporations on the list. 'Unprecedented amounts of spending' 'Of the 200 corporations we examined, we could sum the financial rewards for 179,' said the foundation's report. 'Of those, 138 received more from the federal government than they spent on politics, 102 of them received more than 10 times what they spent on politics, and 29 received 1,000 times or more from the federal government than they invested lobbyists or contributed to political committees ...' The foundation also pointed out that the high court, in its Citizens United ruling - in which a majority of justices ruled that corporations and unions could essentially donate unlimited amounts of money to super PACs - made this determination: 'The appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.' But a quick survey of Americans finds this statement to be absurd on its face; most Americans, the foundation said, were fed up with the way the government currently operates. And, as the campaign finance-tracking website Open Secrets - operated by the Center for Responsive Politics - noted, following the Citizens United ruling, 'unprecedented amounts of outside spending in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles' occurred. 'Giving corporations unlimited power to influence the government corrupted democracy more than any other single act of legislation, and things won't get any better until Citizens United is reversed,' said an assessment of the study from Ring of Fire Radio . 'And since corporations have basically bought and paid for most politicians, it's highly unlikely that will happen any time soon.'

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weak and thin, and prone to fracture, particularly in the hips and spine. There can be few symptoms of osteoporosis until a fracture occurs, so it can only be diagnosed by a bone scan. Approximately one in four post-menopausal women develops osteoporosis. Certain other factors are thought to be risk factors for developing osteoporosis including family history, heavy alcohol use, hyperthyroidism and hyper parathyroidism, smoking, long term use of anticonvulsants and glucocorticosteroids and being white or Asian race. Dietary-wise, those people who eat an imbalanced diet resulting in too many acidifying foods are more likely to develop osteoporosis. The body must strictly keep the blood mildly alkaline. If many acidic foods are eaten, the body has to leech alkalizing calcium from the bones to keep the blood at the mildly alkaline level. Therefore, eating a healthy diet is vital for healthy bones and preventing osteoporosis. Calcium is a key component of our bones. Diets high in salt and sugar can also contribute to the condition because they increase calcium excretion. Women who have lowered estrogen levels have increased risk of osteoporosis as lack of estrogen is thought to increase certain cells which break down bone. Stomach acid is very important for avoiding osteoporosis; it is required for calcium absorption. Liver and kidney disorders can also contribute to osteoporosis because good functioning of these organs is required to metabolize vitamin D into an active useable form for the body. Vitamin D is required to absorb calcium. Nutrient deficiencies of certain key vitamins and minerals for bone health including magnesium, boron, silica, calcium and vitamin D, vitamin K and vitamin C can contribute to osteoporosis . Long term stress is also a risk factor for osteoporosis as it increases bone dissolving adrenalin. Exercise and weight bearing activity is also a key to preventing osteoporosis as it triggers stronger bone formation by the body as a response to the extra strain. Foods to avoid Avoid all fizzy drinks as they contain very high levels of phosphorus which is an acidifying mineral. Avoid all sugar and white refined carbohydrates which increase calcium excretion. Cut out caffeine; three cups per day of coffee can increase the risk of osteoporosis by 82%. Avoid alcohol as it is a highly acidifying drink. Avoid adding salt to your food; it increases calcium excretion. Avoid a diet with excessive protein levels in it as it is acidifying. Eat no more than one palm size portion of meat or fish per meal, and always have plenty of alkalizing foods with your protein. Cut down or cut out dairy products. Ironically milk can be very acidifying to the body, which in turn can leech calcium from bones. Foods to Increase: Increase intake of all kinds of fruits and vegetables as they are very alkalizing. Begin green vegetable juicing daily, which provides a high dosage of alkalizing nutrients quickly in an easily digestible form. Great high calcium greens include kale, spinach, broccoli and all other green leafy vegetables. Eat plenty of lettuce, celery, millet, oats and parsnips; they contain high levels of silica, which is a mineral important for bone regeneration. Increase intake of green leafy vegetables as they also contain vitamin K and magnesium, which are both found to be low in people with osteoporosis and are involved with bone health. Kelp and alfalfa prevent bone loss. Cauliflower, onion soup, berries, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are advisable and are high in vitamin C, which helps produce the collagen that makes up 90% of bone matrix. Use non-dairy rice and oat milk as alternatives to cow's milk. The mineral boron which is important for bone formation is found in apples, pears, grapes, peaches, almonds and hazelnuts. Eat fermented soy products 2-3 times per week in your diet, including tempeh and miso, as these are phyto-estrogens and may provide an estrogen-like effect on the body increasing bone cell production. Lifestyle Changes Stop smoking as it is associated with an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. It is vital to begin weight-bearing exercise. This can include walking, yoga, weight training, swimming, cycling, rebounding, tennis, dancing and gentle jogging. Get some sunshine every day when you can; it promotes the natural production of vitamin D, an important vitamin for calcium absorption. Avoid long term stress as it can over-produce adrenalin which can dissolve bone. All vegetables, especially raw vegetables, balance the acidity and alkali levels in the blood. Although it might seem that citrus fruits would have an acidifying effect on the body, the citric acid they contain actually has an alkalizing effect in the system. www.health-n-energy.com/ARTICLES/9artosteopo... www.connecticutcenterforhealth.com/osteoporo... www.psychologytoday.com/.../osteoporosis-nat... - About the author Alex Howard is author of 'WHY ME?

0," After months of collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare, on the November 8 ballot, Ohio residents opposed to the health care overhaul have finally achieved success. Reports indicate that the group Ohioans for Healthcare Freedom (OHF) helped spearhead a campaign that successfully collected the 358,000 signatures needed to allow Ohioans to vote on an amendment that would prohibit the Buckeye State from complying with Obamacare's provisions. According to an Associated Press release, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has confirmed that supporters of the amendment successfully collected and submitted 427,000 valid signatures, which is nearly 70,000 more than the 358,000 minimum that was needed. And with the help of OHF's 35,000 volunteers across the state, this groundswell of opposition to Obamacare in Ohio builds momentum for other states to follow the same course, and for the US Supreme Court to finally make a ruling on the constitutionality of Obamacare. If passed, the Ohio amendment will prohibit any federal, state, or local law from forcing Ohio residents, employers, or health care providers to comply with any sort of official healthcare system. It will also prohibit the passage or enforcement of any law that tries to set a minimum mandatory threshold for individual healthcare coverage. 'This issue would not be on the ballot without the blood, sweat, and tears of thousands and thousands and thousands of volunteers,' said Jeff Longstreth, campaign manager for OHF. 'The message is clear: keep health care between doctors and patients, and keep bureaucrats out of it.' Ohio Gov. John Kasich has expressed his support for the amendment, as have numerous 'tea party' and religious groups. Opponents of the amendment, however, have until August 5 to file a challenge. And if a challenge is granted, supporters of the amendment will be given ten additional days to gather more signatures .

0," Lead is a ubiquitous industrial chemical and a potent neurotoxin. As such, lead toxicity remains a major public health concern worldwide. Fortunately, research suggests that turmeric root and myrrh can significantly mitigate lead's toxic effects on the body. In a study conducted by researchers from Alexandria University Research Development in Egypt and published in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology in 2006, mice were divided into five separate groups. One group was fed only a normal diet (negative control), while another was fed the same diet plus 0.5 percent w/w toxic lead acetate (positive control). The other three groups were also fed the lead acetate-supplemented diet, plus an additional 1 percent myrrh powder, 1 percent turmeric powder or 5 percent turmeric powder. Reducing lead damage The researchers found that levels of the naturally occurring antioxidant glutathione (GSH) decreased significantly in all mice exposed to lead acetate, indicating lead toxicity. In addition, activity of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) was significantly lower in the positive control group than in any of the other groups. Among its other functions, GST interacts with GSH to help detoxify cells. In all three experimental groups, however, activity of GST significantly increased compared with both the positive and negative control groups. This means that GST activity was actually higher in mice given both lead and turmeric or myrrh than in mice not given lead at all. Furthermore, the researchers found that levels of lipid peroxidation in liver homogenate and bone marrow chromosomes were significantly increased in the positive control group, indicating higher levels of cell and DNA damage. These levels were decreased by 31 percent, however, among mice whose diets were supplemented with 1 percent turmeric powder, by 45 percent among mice given 1 percent myrrh powder, and by 49 percent among mice given 5 percent turmeric powder. Among all the mice treated with lead, the researchers were able to observe signs of lead genotoxicity, including increases in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, increases in the number of aberrant cells and decreases in the number of cells dividing. All of these markers of genotoxicity were reduced by supplementation with turmeric or myrrh; as before, the greatest protective benefit was seen with a dose of 5 percent turmeric. 'It may be concluded that turmeric and myrrh are useful herbal remedies,' the researchers concluded, 'especially for controlling oxidative damages and genotoxicity induced by lead acetate intoxication.' The benefits of healing plants Turmeric and myrrh both have a long history of use as healing plants, and turmeric in particular has been heavily studied by Western science for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The active ingredients in turmeric are known as the curcuminoids, or simply as curcumin. Studies suggest, in fact, that they may be as effective of an anti-inflammatory as certain over-the-counter drugs, but without the side effects. Another series of studies found that curcumin supplementation could improve heart health as much as moderate aerobic exercise; health benefits were magnified dramatically when curcumin and exercise were combined. Curcumin has also been shown to be able to insert itself into cell membranes, helping to protect them from infection and cancer. It functions as an antiviral and antibiotic. Research has even linked curcumin to improvement in certain chronic health conditions, including cancer, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory bowel disease. As for myrrh, studies have shown that it can help relieve inflammation, heart disorders, menstrual irregularities and pain, arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, digestive upset, bronchial congestion, skin disorders and even cold sores. It helps support healthy functioning of the liver and spleen as well. See heavy metals lab results for off-the-shelf foods, superfoods, herbs, supplements and more at: http://labs.selfnews.com "
0," Recent cyber attacks on media giants such as the New York Times and The Washington Post have escalated concerns for strict internet regulations that would prevent future attacks. This has led the House of Representatives to pass the highly controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) with 288-127 vote. Last year, Congress's CISPA bill fell flat on its face, defeated by online freedom activists across the United States. Opponents to the bill are taking action again, including 300,000 who have already contacted Mike Rogers, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Another 100,000 or more signatures opposing CISPA have already been obtained on the White House's own website. Why people far and wide are opposing this controlling bill The idea of CISPA, introduced back in November 2011, was to allow companies to share internet traffic data with the government to detect possible cyber attacks. The idea has been rejected by internet freedom advocates and over 40 civil liberty organizations. This power grab is creating an uproar; many are fed up with being monitored and force-fed information. A controlled internet sphere would enable a select few to delegate what goes in and out of the internet, all in the name of national security. This blind adherence to security would throw away every ounce of liberty that has made the internet a great place to learn new information and spread ideas. What information could government collect? Information such as online chats, email content, browsing history, and bank records would all be up for grabs if this bill passes. The government's national security network could become a government spy network that could gain legal access to anyone's private online information. Under the new CISPA , the government could access a person's information from a corporation and hand it over to the National Security Agency. This could lead to a stealth war against freedom loving Americans. National security spies might begin targeting specific people they deem as threats to the status quo. They could then go after truthful journalists, those who post anti-government sentiment on their social media profiles, or those who back liberty in any online way. Google, Facebook and Apple are in favor of the new CISPA bill TechNet, the trade association that represents technology companies like Google, Apple and Facebook, has expressed support for CISPA in a recent letter written to the US House of Representatives. On the contrary, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is hard at work, opposing CISPA. Ohanian recently posted a YouTube video calling for Google and Facebook to understand that CISPA would invalidate their current privacy policies with their respective user bases. 'If someone wants private access to our private home or to our mail, we ask them to go get a warrant, right?' Ohanian asks in his video. 'CISPA basically says, 'Not necessary. Your digital privacy is irrelevant.'' The death of new ideas If sites like Facebook, Google, or Twitter complied with national or international regulations, the very essence of websites, free speech, and the internet would be destroyed. A controlled cyberspace would destroy new ideas as people become forced to comply with new globalist cyber rules and regulations. The very strength of the internet - the spreading of new ideas, the connection of people far and wide would be at risk, as massive new security protocols would threaten the very livelihood of the internet. This would create a cyberspace police state, capable of becoming a controlling propaganda machine. Write a letter to your representatives now and tell them what you think about this intrusive new CISPA. "
0," It's being described as an enhancement to security, but what it amounts to is just another way the federal government is becoming more invasive and less tolerant of your privacy. The Transportation Security Administration has announced recently (and very quietly) that it is expanding a so-called watch list of individuals who are supposedly in violation of the intrusive agency's security rules. The announcement came in the form of an entry in the Federal Register in late 2012: As part of the effort to identify individuals that are low risk, TSA also is creating and maintaining a watch list of individuals who are disqualified from eligibility from TSA Pre[check]TM, for some period of time or permanently, because they have been involved in violations of security regulations of sufficient severity or frequency. Just because you're a 'preferred' customer doesn't mean you won't be searched anyway According to the TSA's website, the pre-screening program 'allows select frequent flyers of participating airlines and members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Trusted Traveler programs to receive expedited screening benefits during domestic travel. Eligible participants use dedicated screening lanes for screening benefits which include leaving on shoes, light outerwear and belts, as well as leaving laptops and 3-1-1 compliant liquids in carry-on bags.' In 'qualifying' for the program; however, the traveler is allowing TSA access to all of your personal information, in exchange for skirting the chaotic and invasive pre-boarding examination every other traveler has to endure. The announcement continued: Disqualifying violations of aviation security regulations may involve violations at the airport or on board aircraft, such as a loaded firearm that is discovered in carry-on baggage at the checkpoint, or a threat to use a destructive device against a transportation conveyance, facilities, or personnel. The TSA Pre[check]TM Disqualification List will be generated by TSA's Performance and Results Information System (PARIS). What is ironic about this program is that regardless of whether a traveler qualifies, he or she will still be 'randomly' subjected to the same treatment as other travelers. 'TSA will always incorporate random and unpredictable security measures throughout the airport and no individual will be guaranteed expedited screening,' the agency says on its website, under 'Frequently Asked Questions.' The program really seems to function more as a way for the federal government to gather information on travelers who are fed up with the ridiculously invasive pat-down and screening procedures at the nation's airports. 'Given that it was recently discovered that some TSA procedures, including complaints, are operated and processed in all manner of different ways and at the whim of each individual TSA agent, it is no stretch of the imagination to expect that anyone merely opting out of the body scanners, complaining about pat-downs, or filming at checkpoints could be considered to be in 'violation,' and therefore added to this latest watch list,' InfoWars.com observed. Growing civil liberties issue A few years ago, the American Civil Liberties Union said it was receiving a high volume of complaints from air travelers about the TSA's screening procedures, but that they elected not to complain about it to the agency for fear of being singled out and placed on a watch list . 'These complaints came from men, women and children who reported feeling humiliated and traumatized by these searches, and, in some cases, comparing their psychological impact to sexual assaults,' the ACLU said in a statement. In a suit against the federal government, the civil rights organization is representing citizens who believe they've been put on a TSA no-fly list without explanation. Under current conditions, anyone on that list who submits a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, under which TSA falls, asking to be removed has no way of knowing if their request has been considered, without trying to get on another plane.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) In 1953, a once impossible achievement was accomplished, that being the unraveling and understanding of the DNA molecule, also called deoxyribonucleic acid. Two scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, accomplished what was thought to be impossible. The discovery of the double helix code hidden within all cells opened the floodgates for scientists to begin to study the code that is responsible for the very formation of all life itself. DNA has a genetic language Today, scientists are still trying to apply Darwin's 150 year-old theory of evolution postulated in the 19th century to today's 21st century understanding of DNA. As the code became better understood, what scientists found began to cause more questions than answers. What they found as an amazing language of over 3 billion genetic letters which is hailed as one of the most extraordinary discoveries of the 20th century. As Dr. Stephen Meyer says, director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Wash., 'was that DNA actually stores information -- the detailed instructions for assembling proteins -- in the form of a four-character digital code' (quoted by Lee Strobel, The Case for a Creator, 2004, p. 224). The amount of information in human DNA is roughly equivalent to 12 sets of The Encyclopedia Britannica, an amazing 384 volumes worth of detailed information that would fill 48 feet of library shelves! But the size of a DNA molecule is only two millionths of a millimeter thick. In order for there to be anything resembling a language it must meet the following criteria; an alphabet or coding system, correct spelling, grammar (a proper arrangement of the words), meaning (semantics) and an intended purpose. It has been discovered that DNA meets all of these requirements and in fact, it has all of the same properties as any computer code or language does. Why is that significant? Because the only other codes that have been found to be true languages are those of human origin. While animals do communicate with their own type of communication systems, whether it is sonar, dancing bees, barking dogs or singing birds, none of them have the composition of a language and are only considered low level methods of communication, not true languages since they don't meet the necessary criteria to be such. The only other languages that qaulify to be a language are human languages and artificial languages such as computer language and Morse codes, as well as the genetic code itself. There are no other forms of communication that have been found to have the basic characteristics of a language. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, said this; 'DNA is like a software program, only much more complex than anything we have ever devised'. DNA language and DNA molecules, not the same Recent studies in the field of information theory have yielded some pretty amazing findings. That information itself is different from matter and energy, which are both mediums for carrying information, but are not the information itself. If you look at any book the pages, ink, color, and binding are the medium for storing the information, but not the information itself. That is simply the transport medium for the information. George Williams said this: 'The gene is a package of information, not an object. The pattern of base pairs in a DNA molecule specifies the gene. But the DNA molecule is the medium, it's not the message' (quoted by Johnson, p. 70). Information requires intelligence What this really means is that high level information only originates from an intelligent source. The information that builds and creates life itself is not disorganized at all and it's not simply orderly, as in a salt crystal for example, but it is specific and complex information that accomplishes an unbelievable task, the creation and building of biological machines that are over 100,000 years more technologically advanced than anything we have ever accomplished to date. The precision of this genetic language is so fantastic, that the average mistake that is not caught turns out to be one error per 10 billion letters. If a mistake is not caught in the code, then you get diseases such as sickle cell anemia for example. But not even the most accurate human being doing data entry or typing could even come close to this degree of accuracy, no even close. What this comes down to is that to believe that the genetic code gradually evolved as Darwin claims would break all the known laws of energy, matter and nature. There has never been found anywhere in nature an information system within a cell gradually evolving into another functional information program. Scientists try to explain how evolution might work through mutations, but mutations do not give instructions to rebuild a new structure or organism as claimed. All a mutation can do is cause a misdirection or misapplication in a single sentence in a gene which can result is a defect of an existing structure, but not a new structure itself. The only explanation for this language is that it has been designed by an intelligence far greater than that of humans beings. Evolution provides No answers Even Francis Crick, one of the agnostic men who discovered the genetic code said near the end of his life, 'an honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going' (Life Itself, 1981, p. 88, emphasis added). Even with all the scientists around the world working feverishly, not one has even been able to produce a single human hair, let alone a being of infinitely more complexity as a human is with over 100 trillion cells. Another problem with evolution is 'Where does the new information in the code come from to create a new organism?' Darwinian scientists try to counter these arguments by saying things like the genetic code already had all the information contained within it and that those codes were merely activated by the various forces such as cosmic rays for example that cause new organisms to form . That is merely a trigger, but again, where or how did the information get there in the first place and who or what created this language to begin with? Darwinian evolution is still taught in schools as though it was fact, but more and more scientists are beginning to question it. Scientist and former atheist Patrick Glynn said, 'As recently as 25 years ago a reasonable person weighting the purely scientific evidence on the issue would likely have come down on the side of skepticism in regards to a creator. That is no longer the case. Today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the God Hypothesis. It is the simplest and most obvious solution...' (God: The Evidence, 1997 pp.54-55, 53) Evolution tells us that through chance mutations and natural selection, living things evolve. Yet to evolve means to gradually change certain aspects of some living thing until it becomes another type of creature, and this can only be done by adding genetic information into the DNA itself. According to molecular biologist Michael Denton, 'Each cell with genetic information, from bacteria to man, consists of artificial languages and their decoding systems, memory banks for information storage and retrieval, elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of parts and components, error fail-safe and proof-reading devices utilized for quality control, assembly processes involving the principle of prefabrication and modular construction... [and a] capacity not equaled in any of our most advanced machines, for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours' (Denton, p. 329). How can all of the information required to create bacteria evolve into information from another type of being when all it takes to destroy the bacteria is one of a few mistakes in the millions of letters that make up the bacteria's DNA? Evolutionary scientists are as usual very silent on the subject; they don't have even a working theory of how this could possibly be. It actually takes far more faith to believe in evolution, then it does to believe in a supreme creative power and intellect in the universe. Lee Strobel writes: 'The six feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made... No hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means' (Strobel, p. 282). Werner Gitt, professor of information systems, said this: 'The basic flaw of all evolutionary views is the origin of the information in living beings. It has never been shown that a coding system and semantic information could originate by itself [through matter]... The information theorems predict that this will never be possible. A purely material origin of life is thus [ruled out]' (Gitt, p. 124). Even with all the evidence covered so far about intelligent design of DNA, consider this. For DNA to be truly effective, it turns out that the perfect number of letters in the code has been calculated to be four letter, no more, no less. This is the number of letters that is mathematically calculated to be the most effective for DNA to function as it does. Turns out this is precisely what we find in the genes of all living creatures on planet Earth, four letters in their DNA code. Once again, Werner Gitt states: 'The coding system used for living beings is optimal from an engineering standpoint. This fact strengthens the argument that it was a case of purposeful design rather than a [lucky] chance' (Gitt, p. 95). The Bottom Line The words of King David written thousands of years ago ring even truer in light of new revelations of today. 'For You formed my inward parts, You covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made... My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought...' (Psalm 139:13-15, emphasis added). The agnostic scientist, Michael Denton concludes: 'Ultimately the Darwinian theory of evolution is no more nor less than the great cosmogenic myth of the twentieth century' (Denton, p. 358). Further Thought As I have taught many people, chi-gung, breathing and meditation can greatly increase our faith in the things that we can not now see or feel. This is done by learning to build up, cultivate and use our own spirit and that starts with learning to cultivate our chi. When you can feel, use and see the results that Chi-gung can bring into your life, when you can use your own chi to prevent and heal injuries, increase your own health, stamina and even heal others with enough time and training, then your faith in the things that you can't see are greatly increased and enhanced. So much so that it eventually becomes easy to believe in a supreme Spirit, creator and source for the very universe itself. When you learn to harness the power of the universe and it becomes a very real thing and force in your life, you now have proof through your own efforts and training that Chi and Spirit, things that can't be proven scientifically yet, are in fact very real and powerful. Once you can use your own spirit and energy to do things, the stories contained in the bible and other religions of the world and the very belief in a Supreme Spirit Creator and Father take on a whole new meaning not possible otherwise. This is one of Chi-gung's greatest and most amazing benefits to me. Just as I have been able to show many skeptics the power of chi born from decades of martial arts, chi-gung training, meditation and more, it also helps to greatly increase my own faith in the very real and physical presence and existence of God Himself. That doesn't mean that this is the goal of chi-gung, but if that is something that you are struggling with, then learning to cultivate, build up and use your own chi can and will greatly help you to believe in that unseen spirit world (The Yin world) and can indeed help you to believe that there can indeed be such a one as a supreme spirit intellect in the universe. Just as many formerly agnostic but thankfully honest scientists are now starting to see this same truth for themselves.

0," Exposure among amphibians and other vertebrate animals to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide has been shown, for the very first time, to actually induce physical changes to the shapes of these animals' bodies. Published in the journal Ecological Applications , the new study reveals once again the incredible hormone-altering power of Roundup, and how even minute exposure to this highly-toxic chemical brew can have disastrous health consequences. In their natural environment, tadpoles, which are just amphibians in the larval stage of their life cycle, have a natural ability to detect the presence of predators and respond accordingly. In order to avoid insect predators, for instance, tadpoles can actually develop deeper or longer tails in order to swim away from them faster, which helps ensure their survival ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10862727 ). But it appears as though Roundup, which has already been shown in other studies to be highly pervasive throughout the environment ( http://www.selfnews.com/033699_Roundup_pollution.html ), induces these very same physical changes. And when exposed to both Roundup and natural predators, tadpoles will develop grossly large tails that are much larger than normal, which is likely the result of both the tadpoles' detection of Roundup, and Roundup's ability to chemically-induce hormonal changes. 'What shocked us was that the Roundup induced the same changes,' said Rick Relyea, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Pittsburgh 's (Pitt) Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences and director of Pitt's Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology , referring to changes in the tadpoles' tails that caused them to actually become twice as large as normal. 'This discovery highlights the fact that pesticides [...] can have unintended consequences for species that are not the pesticides' target. [W]e are learning that [pesticides and herbicides] can have a wide range of surprising effects by altering how hormones work in the bodies of animals .' For his study, Relyea examined how tadpoles living in water tanks respond to varying exposures of Roundup, as well as to predators. And his findings revealed that Roundup visibly alters tadpoles' stress hormones, which appears to coincide with an earlier study that revealed Roundup-induced hormonal changes in humans ( http://www.selfnews.com/035135_Roundup_herbicide_testosterone.html ). Meanwhile, more than a dozen Argentinian farmers have filed a lawsuit against Monsanto, creator of Roundup, and several tobacco companies for allegedly knowingly poisoning them with Roundup and other pesticide and herbicide chemicals. According to the filing, Monsanto's pesticides and herbicides caused the farmers' children to be born with 'devastating birth defects' ( http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/04/10/45469.htm ). "
0," Students attending a panel discussion with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, that took place at Yale University's School of Management last year, thought they were there to learn more about the globalization of technology. But a video montage of what actually took place at the creepy event reveals that it was actually more of a product placement marketing ploy to promote aspartame-laden Diet Coke. The roughly hour-long panel discussion, which was captured on video, features Schmidt repeatedly touching and fondling a carefully-placed Diet Coke can perched on a table next to his seat. A three-minute condensed video highlighting all the moments that Schmidt gestured towards, touched, or drank from the can clearly reveal that Diet Coke was just as much a featured member of the panel as Schmidt was. Was the can really empty? In the video, Schmidt can be seen awkwardly touching and fondling the can at least five different times, as well as drinking from it at least a dozen times. Each time he picked up or otherwise moved the can, Schmidt was careful to set it back down with the label facing outward in clear view of all the students and the camera filming him. But this isn't the most disturbing part. From the beginning of the discussion to the end, it appears as though there is nothing actually in the Diet Coke can, and that Schmidt is merely pretending to drink from it. Each time he tipped it back to take a drink, Schmidt angled the can roughly the same way every time, suggesting that it is empty. One would think that after taking 12 separate gulps the angle of the can would change, but this wasn't the case. Schmidt clearly angled his can the same way the first time he supposedly took a drink as he did the last time he took a drink. And multiple times throughout the discussion, Schmidt accidentally set the can down too hard, making a sharp clank noise exposing it as empty. You can watch the shocking video here: http://youtu.be/QtXQQXKH9wo Schmidt's Diet Coke stunt encouraged millions to consume poison Interestingly, Schmidt can be heard swallowing a few times in the video, which some have suggested proves there was liquid in the can. But it is very easy to fake a swallow without actually swallowing anything, and to have it make a noise -- try it for yourself! To the honest viewer, it is clear that Schmidt was pretending to drink Diet Coke , and carefully made sure the Diet Coke logo was featured throughout the event. This is an increasingly common marketing tactic for junk food manufacturers, who routinely use celebrities, high-profile businessmen, and other people in the media spotlight to promote their products. In this case, it seems apparent that Schmidt was recruited to endorse Diet Coke by the fact that he pretended to drink it in front of a room full of college students, subconsciously encouraging them to do the same. Diet Coke, as our readers probably well know, is a poisonous beverage loaded with toxic aspartame and other deadly chemicals. This ubiquitous sweetening additive has been linked to heart disease, obesity, and a host of other chronic ailments that Schmidt, if he uses his own search engine to conduct research, should already know as well. But he clearly doesn't care, if he does know, since he shamelessly promoted aspartame while inadvertently exposing himself as a sellout and a shill. selfnews readers know better than to fall for this type of deception, but many others out there who still trust these corporate clowns unfortunately don't.

0," A ranking Food and Drug Administration official is facing four counts of soliciting prostitution and a single count of disorderly conduct stemming from his arrest by Howard County, Md., Police last month. Dr. William Maisel, the deputy director for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health , was nabbed July 13 during an undercover sting operation along a busy corridor in Laurel, reports said. Maisel was one of ten suspected arrested in the operation. In a statement, the agency declined to speculate or comment, saying only, 'This is a personal matter and unrelated to the work of the FDA or Dr. Maisel's work at the agency,' according to spokeswoman Erica Jefferson. 'Dr. Maisel is still employed by the agency and is working.' His mug shot is available here . Maisel, who joined the FDA in 2010, is scheduled for a preliminary court hearing Sept. 20. A smart guy - Just a bad choice Prior to the FDA, Maisel, 46, held prominent positions at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and taught at Harvard Medical School , said reports. According to the website Vitals.com , which profiles physicians, Maisel is a Board-certified cardiologist who attended Cornell Medical College . A separate website belonging to the Medical Device Manufacturer's Association listed additional biographical information: William H. Maisel, MD, MPH is Chief Scientist and Deputy Center Director for Science at FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). He is responsible for providing leadership in the development, implementation, execution, management and direction of the Center's broad national and international biomedical science programs. He is also a former chair of the FDA Circulatory System and Post-Market Medical Device Advisory Committees, and is a former member of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Coverage Advisory Committee. Beside his medical degree, he also has a an undergraduate degree in biology from MIT , and a master's in Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health . 'Maisel joined the agency as its first deputy director for science in 2010, but his interactions with the agency date back to 2003 when he advised the Center for Devices and Radiological Health as a consultant,' said a report in MedCity News . Extensive history and experience Among Maisel's cardiology specialties is arrhythmia - irregular, improper heart rhythms that can cause circulatory problems and even death. Reports suggest Maisel applied his cardiology specialties to the medical devices industry. In 2005, for example, he conducted a study for the FDA that found 20 out of every 1,000 implanted heart defibrillators were malfunctioning, failures which led to some 31 deaths between 1990 and 2002, USA Today reported. The study found there were 2.25 million pacemakers and almost 416,000 implanted cardiac defibrillators, or ICDs, implanted in the United States, the paper said. Of those, 17,000 of them - 8,834 pacemakers and 8,489 ICDs - had to be removed because of malfunctions. In an editorial this year, he touted the agency's role in approving new medical devices. 'Each year, millions of American patients benefit from innovative medical devices that reduce suffering, treat previously untreatable conditions, extend lives, and improve public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is committed to assuring that patients have timely access to important new technologies and next-generation medical devices without compromising safety,' he wrote. It wasn't clear whether the FDA would retain Maisel at publication time, nor if he planned to plead guilty in court.

0," There is yet another thing that your government didn't tell you about Obamacare and its subsequent expansion of Medicaid: If you enroll in the taxpayer-funded health coverage program through an Obamacare exchange, then, when you die, your estate will be taken by the government. As reported by the Seattle Times : It wasn't the moonlight, holiday-season euphoria or family pressure that made Sofia Prins and Gary Balhorn, both 62, suddenly decide to get married. It was the fine print. As fine print is wont to do, it had buried itself in a long form - Balhorn's application for free health insurance through the expanded state Medicaid program. As the paperwork lay on the dining-room table in Port Townsend, Prins began reading. She was shocked: If you're 55 or over, Medicaid can come back after you're dead and bill your estate for ordinary health-care expenses. Penalizing the poor in the end Suddenly, the Prins no longer saw that obtaining their health insurance through Medicaid was going to be 'free.' Rather, it's more of a loan - one whose requirements to pay back premiums isn't very well advertised. Not only that, the requirement is punitive, as most government mandates are: It penalizes folks who, though they may be poor, have managed to keep a house or accrue some savings they hoped to pass along to heirs. In reality, Medicaid - in compliance with federal policy - has long recouped payouts via estates. But, because the majority of low-income Americans without disabilities couldn't otherwise qualify for typical medical coverage under Medicaid , 'recovery primarily involved expenses for nursing homes and long-term care,' the Times said. Obamacare changed all of that by expanding Medicaid coverage to many more Americans. In Washington state, lawmakers are hearing from distraught and angry constituents as they learn about the great government Medicaid recovery plan that no one told them about. In response, lawmakers are looking at what they can do to repair the clash of state rules with the Affordable Care Act: [Recently] , Gov. Jay Inslee's office and the state Medicaid office said they plan to draft an emergency rule to limit estate recovery to long-term care and related medical expenses. They hope to be able to change the rules before coverage begins Jan. 1. Fixing the problem will cost the state about $3 million a year, said Dr. Bob Crittenden, Inslee's senior health-policy adviser, but it's the right thing to do. 'There was no intent on the part of the ACA to do estate recovery on people going into Medicaid (for health insurance),' Crittenden said. 'The idea was to expand coverage.' 'People will think this is free' The Times said residents in their 50s and 60s currently make up about 30 percent of adults who have signed up through the state's Obamacare exchange. Some residents 55-60 years old who have either taken early retirements or who became unemployed due to the recent recession have now found themselves in a low-income bracket. In the past, in order to qualify for Medicaid, applicants were required to reduce their assets; with the Obamacare expansion, however, now more recipients are better off and more likely to have homes and other assets. Writing in The Washington Times , Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, labeled the recovery provision 'a cash cow for states to milk the poor and the middle class.' 'People will think this is wonderful, this is free insurance,' Orient said in an interview. 'They don't realize it's really a loan, and is secured by any property they have.' She went on to warn that even states that move to limit estate recovery can eventually change the rules again if they begin to have budget shortfalls.

0," A state lawmaker in Tennessee is fed up with President Obama's incessant quest to flood America with as many non-English-speaking and potentially dangerous immigrants he possibly can before stepping down from office in January 2017. So fed up, in fact, that he is calling for a radical measure to rid his state of immigrants who are from parts of the world where terrorism is born and bred get the National Guard involved and round them up, then use the troops to prevent more from entering. 'We need to activate the Tennessee National Guard and stop them from coming in to the state by whatever means we can,' said House GOP Caucus Chairman Glen Casada, a Republican from Franklin and one of the chamber's top members, in reference to Syrian refugees in the state. Casada made his comments following the horrific murder of more than 129 people in Paris, France an attack that involved several members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and which occurred at a half-dozen locations around the capital city. 'Tennessee is a sovereign state' 'I'm not worried about what a bureaucrat in D.C. or an unelected judge thinks. ... We need to gather (Syrian refugees) up and politely take them back to the ICE center and say, 'They're not coming to Tennessee, they're yours,'' he said, as reported by The Tennessean newspaper in its online edition. Casada is practically alone in his call for an all-out effort to send newly arrived refugees back to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers. That said, there is definitely a rising sentiment among the state's lawmakers, and in particular among its Republican majority, to do something to mitigate peoples' fears that at least some of the new arrivals may harbor violent jihadist intentions. Asked to provide details about his plan and whether he seriously believes it is viable, Casada replied: ' Tennessee is a sovereign state. If the federal government is forsaking the obligation to protect our citizens, we need to act.' Some of Tennessee's lawmakers were vehemently opposed to and no doubt gave the appearance of being offended by Casada's call for action. 'I think that is one of the most extraordinarily misguided statements that I have heard made by a public official,' House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, a Democrat from Nashville, told The Tennessean . He has asked the state's attorney general, Herbert Slattery, for an opinion regarding the issue. 'We need to approach this issue from a standpoint of strength and not fear, and we should have great confidence in our military forces and in our law enforcement agencies to keep our citizens safe. We don't need to go off half-cocked and start interfering in the defense policy of our country,' Stewart added. 'They' are heading our way Tennessee is just one state, of course, and what lawmakers there ultimately decide to do will be up to them and their constituents. And Casada's call to use the National Guard to root out and expel refugees is certainly an extreme measure. But according to a new Bloomberg News survey , a clear majority of Americans want President Obama's plan to resettle tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in the U.S. stopped. What is also clear is that tens of millions of Americans share Casada's concern that at least some of the new arrivals to the U.S. from Syria do in fact include violent Islamist extremists . At least one of the operatives involved in the attack had a passport from a Western nation Greece and was known to have traveled back and forth between Europe and the war-torn Syria. Also, U.S. officials working with other governments in our hemisphere have identified several Syrian men with fake passports moving towards the U.S. ( here , in Texas; here , in Honduras; and here , in Costa Rica).

0," If you think electing Hillary Clinton as president will somehow bring about anything other than business as usual in Washington, there's some beachfront property in Colorado with your name on it. Nearly every top donor to the Clinton Foundation that actively lobbied Hillary's State Department is connected to pharmaceuticals, vaccines, junk food, globalization, chemicals, oil and biotechnology, which means more business as usual should this criminal gain access to the Oval Office. This link outlines 181 Clinton Foundation donors who lobbied Hillary's State Department. As you'll notice, the top contributors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is on record as wanting to see every child in the world jabbed with dozens of vaccines; the Walmart corporation, which is the world's leading supplier of Chinese-made consumer crap; Coca-Cola, one of the top contributors to the diabetes epidemic; Goldman Sachs, which profited heavily from the central bank-caused housing collapse; and many other corporate players. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in fact, is the top contributor to the Clinton Foundation, having dispensed at least $26 million since it began, according to official records. This is noteworthy because the Gates clan is a heavy promoter of not only vaccines but also genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), which it claims will 'cure hunger' in Africa. The Gates Foundation also has major investments in both Cargill and Monsanto, the world's most evil corporation. This is clearly a major conflict of interest as Hillary aims to become top dog in the land of the free-for-all, where citizens are given the best government money can buy. If she is elected as president, Hillary will have an obligation to repay her corporate donors for their services, which will mean an even more powerful fascist-ocracy that pushes drugs, vaccines and junk food on the masses. Other Clinton Foundation donors include the Dow Chemical Company and Pfizer, both of which are heavily vested in foisting more poisons on the public for profit. Dow Chemical, as you might recall, is the corporation behind the new 2,4-D Agent Orange-based crop pesticide that was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last fall. '2,4-D and other herbicides of its class have been independently associated with deadly immune system cancers, Parkinson's disease, endocrine disruption, and reproductive problems, with children at particular risk,' reports the Center for Food Safety (CFS). Go, Hillary! Hillary Clinton will facilitate agricultural takeover of Africa by multinational corporations Then there is the so-called 'Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa,' an organization that has reportedly donated between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation. This Alliance, which is really just a 'public relations flagship' for the Gates Foundation's pro-GMO agenda, is pushing to destroy all native agriculture throughout Africa and replace it with corporate-owned biotechnologies. This would eliminate agricultural sovereignty and enslave Africans to multinational corporations like Monsanto. 'Under the guise of 'sustainability' the (Gates) Foundation has been spearheading a multi-billion dollar effort to transform Africa into a GMO-friendly continent,' reported Eric Holt Gimenez, executive director of the Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy, for The Huffington Post . 'Africa's seeds are a potential windfall investment for Monsanto. Regardless of the philanthropic side of its intentions, cloaked in the sheep's clothing of AGRA, the Gates Foundation is moving stealthily opening the African seed market to global corporations. When the research, extension, and U.S. foreign aid is all in place, Monsanto will swoop in for the feast.'

0," Winter is the season of the kidney according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is especially important to tend to these organs during this time. With a measure of proper care and attention, kidney health is strengthened while painful stones and infections are avoided. Through straightforward dietary and lifestyle choices, the kidneys can be kept clear, untroubled and vigorous. Winter - A season to nourish and rebuild As observed in traditional Chinese medicine, when the kidneys are unbalanced, the emotion of fear arises. The reverse is equally true. When we are in a state of chronic fear or anxiety, the kidneys become depleted. The cold, winter months can aggravate the kidneys further -- it is vital to pay particular attention to these organs during this time. Staying warm (especially the feet) while protecting against chills and cold wind encourages harmony within the kidneys. Enjoying soups, stews and seasonal, grounding vegetables like winter squash maintain kidney equilibrium too. Additionally, a brief meditation from The Organ-Emotion Link helps to balance these tiny bean shaped organs as well: 'Sit in qigong posture for a few minutes, with the eyes lightly closed. Make sure you are relaxed and breathing naturally...Now focus on the kidneys. Let the inhalation fill the kidneys with wisdom, with the confidence of inner knowing - Exhale all fears. Repeat several [times].' Traditional Chinese medicine states that winter is a season of warmth, replenishment and rest -- this is not the time to be cold, stressed or overworked. Robust kidneys are linked with slowing down, nurturing ourselves with seasonal whole foods and bundling up. Modern medicine also addresses kidney health, but in a more diet-focused manner. Kidney health basics We usually don't think about the kidneys as long as both are functioning properly. The kidneys are one of our most important organs, filtering an incredible 200 quarts of blood per day. When disease sets in, whether with kidney stones or an infection, severe pain follows. And kidney stones can lead to serious complications if they become lodged in the urinary tract. This is reason enough to keep these organs zipping along. Luckily, diet is extremely effective in preventing a painful kidney wake-up call. As seen in How to keep your kidneys healthy, happy and stone-free , some of the best foods for the kidneys include: Cranberry Collard greens Spinach Kelp Sesame seeds Sardines Broccoli Aloe vera Garbanzo beans Apple cider vinegar Magnesium Potassium Moreover, freshly made lemonade has been shown to significantly reduce kidney stones. In order to keep these painful crystals at bay, drink four ounces of lemon juice in two liters of purified water each day. According to TCM, green tea, asparagus, garlic, parsley, celery and fish are also beneficial. Drinking plenty of water, reducing both refined salt and excessive protein supports strong kidneys too. Maintaining healthy and happy kidneys not only minimizes distressing and painful maladies, but also fosters fearlessness -- infusing emotional stability into our day-to-day lives. By utilizing the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine along with modern science, the kidneys can be hardy and thriving throughout the winter season and beyond. "
0," June is National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. Many foods deservedly stand in the healthy spotlight for their ability to help heal and keep the body functioning at optimal levels, and the artichoke is no different. Artichoke hearts, which are part of the Cynara genus, provide a host of heath benefits (1). Incorporating them into diets often is an ideal way to help the body stay in shape so people can remain as healthy as possible. Health benefits of artichokes 1) Fights damaging free radicals So powerful is the vitamin C content in artichokes that the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) system has given this food a score nine times higher than other antioxidant-rich foods (1). ORAC rates foods based on their antioxidant capacity; foods high in antioxidants are known to fight off free radicals that damage cells and wreak havoc on the body. 2) Relief from indigestion pain Studies have shown that artichoke leaf extract provides relief to those suffering from acid reflux or indigestion pain, leading members of some European scientific advisory boards to authorize use of artichoke to help people with everything from mild diarrhea and nausea to bloating and stomach discomfort (1). 3) Cholesterol-reducing ability Artichoke has been found to contain compounds that play a role in the reduction of cholesterol in the blood, making it a good choice for those with related concerns (2). Specifically, the compounds are sesquiterpene-lactones and cynarin. 4) Boosts brain health Because artichokes are a source of vitamin K, which is linked to facilitating brain health by reducing damage to neurons in that organ, it may help patients with Alzheimer's disease (2). Furthermore, artichokes are known to act as a vasodilator, which simply means that the food has properties that expand blood vessels, letting more oxygen reach the brain (3). When there is more oxygen in the brain, improved cognitive abilities can result. Enjoy the benefits of artichokes not only during National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month, but every day. Always be sure to choose fresh, organic options. "
0," Of all the times Republicans have made fun of Nancy Pelosi for saying we have to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it, they're now invoking the exact same twisted logic with the push for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). They want to enact the agreement without the public -- or even most lawmakers -- having a chance to read it first. The TPP is a secretive trade deal that the Obama administration refuses to make public. Click here for Wikileaks documents on the TPP, and click here to read how the TPP threatens natural supplements and cosmetic products . Public Citizen warns that the TPP would expand pharmaceutical monopolies and encourage even more patent abuse by Big Pharma. The TPP is believed to contain provisions that could: Strongly promote the monopolistic intellectual property practices of drug companies and biotech firms , both of which occupy the top positions of the 'most evil corporations' on the planet. Destroy the Second Amendment and restrict the sales of firearms and ammunition to the public, as warned by Gun Owners of America Executive Director Larry Pratt . Outlaw GMO labeling nationwide. Destroy the natural supplements marketplace by criminalizing vitamins, herbs and superfood supplements. Criminalize the saving of seeds without corporate approval, effectively turning seed sharing operations into 'criminal enterprises' subject to armed raids by the federal 'seed police.' For the record, the FBI already works for Monsanto as detailed in this shocking article . Republicans now operating under the same insidious secrecy we witnessed with Obamacare Republicans, who incessantly seek to hand more monopolistic power to evil corporations (as opposed to Democrats, who incessantly seek to hand more power to evil governments), have pushed hard for passage of the TPP , fraudulently calling it a 'free trade agreement' even though it may actually restrict many free trade activities domestically. The TPP promotes free trade in exactly the same way the U.S. Patriot Act promotes patriots. It doesn't , in other words. The name is a marketing gimmick to conceal the true nature of the agreement, which remains shrouded in astonishing secrecy . Far from promoting free trade, the TPP seems to be a globalist-oriented corporate-pushed framework that would strip power from the U.S. Congress and destroy national sovereignty on trade issues. It would allow foreign governments to dictate what products U.S. companies can sell to the American people , and under what terms. And under the provisions being pushed by Republicans , Congress would be powerless to stop it. (Today's spineless Republicans just can't wait to give up more power and make Congress totally irrelevant, it seems...) Democrats spearhead opposition and block a key vote Stunningly, the Democrats have mustered enough key allies to halt a vote on one of the procedural prerequisites for the TPP. 'Senate Democrats filibustered Tuesday to block the first major free-trade vote in years, dealing a blow to President Obama and GOP leaders,' reports the Washington Times . The effort was led by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, who I've often thought of as the most courageous Democrat in the Senate. Like all Senators, he's still willing to violate the Constitution when convenient, but he's also one of the few U.S. Senators willing to take a stand for what he believes in. 'Unlike the last few years' worth of conservative objections, this time it was liberals who balked and pulled moderate Democrats with them, putting the brakes on the bipartisan push and imperiling the rest of the spring congressional agenda,' the Times says, reporting from the view that halting the TPP is a bad thing. The National Journal reports, 'Tuesday's vote represents a major blow to Obama, who lobbied hard for the bill, from foes within his own party, as most Democrats sided with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others who led the coalition of labor and progressive activists that oppose the deal.' To the great astonishment of everyone, this TPP fraudulent trade agreement has Obama allied with Republicans , and Democrats resisting tyranny! When was the last time you ever heard of that happening? "
0," A flu vaccine manufactured by Novartis is killing people in Italy, with the death toll now rising to 13 people according to a reports from The Age, News.com and WAtoday.com.au. [1] [2] [3] 'The number of people who have died in Italy after being administered a flu vaccine made by Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has risen to 13,' say reports. The deaths occurred 'within 48 hours of being administered the [vaccine]' and Italian health authorities have issued a partial ban on the vaccination batches believed to be causing the fatalities. Because flu vaccines are falsely assumed by governments to be 100% safe -- despite the mounting evidence of their dangers and the fact that they contain toxic mercury -- the global media usually ignores vaccination adverse effects and fatalities. Even this story covering the 13 fatalities dutifully carried a denial from official government health authorities, saying 'The Italian Medical Agency (AIFA) has warned against panic and stressed there is not proof yet that it was the vaccine that led to the deaths.' selfnews Labs confirms mercury in flu shots A laboratory analysis of flu vaccines that I conducted using ICP-MS instrumentation at the selfnews Forensic Food Labs found flu shots containing 25,000 times the mercury concentration allowed in drinking water by the EPA. [4] More recent research I conducted in the last few weeks has found extremely high levels of toxic aluminum in vaccines as well. Those data will be published soon here on selfnews . It is an irrefutable fact that vaccines are intentionally formulated with mercury and aluminum -- both toxic metals that compromise human health when injected into the body. Mercury is, of course, a toxic heavy metal linked to birth defects, spontaneous abortions, kidney failure and neurological damage. Aluminum, used as an inflammatory adjuvant in vaccines, is linked to Alzheimer's and dementia. The true history of the failure of vaccines is detailed by Dr. Suzanne Humphries in a book and website named Dissolving Illusions . The graphs on this website showing how vaccines usually came along after an infectious disease was also conquered are especially fascinating. What keeps killing people who receive flu shots and HPV vaccines? Despite the presence of mercury and aluminum in many vaccines, the quantities of these metals typically used in vaccines are unlikely to cause death within 48 hours after inoculation. When people are killed by flu vaccines, the far more likely explanation is a serious quality control failure during the manufacture of the vaccine which might have introduced unusually high concentrations of toxic metals or deadly viral strains which were not properly inactivated (and thus infected the victims). Dr. Maurice Hilleman, former Merck virologist, explained many years ago how vaccines often contained 'stealth cancer viruses' that caused cancer . As many as 98 million Americans were injected with cancer-causing viruses during the mass polio vaccination campaigns of the 1960's and 70's. This is a fact the CDC used to publicly acknowledge but scrubbed from its website in 2013 in an effort to hide this medical history from the public. Vaccine manufacturers are granted absolute legal immunity in the United States. No person damaged by vaccines can file suit against vaccine companies in the civil courts. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the legal immunity granted to vaccine manufacturers overrides the Supreme Court itself, essentially declaring that the United States Constitution was nullified by the unprecedented legal protections granted to vaccine manufacturers. Vaccine injury program riddled with failures A recent Associated Press investigation found the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in America to be riddled with outrageous failures and contradictions. As the AP reported on Nov. 21 of this year: [9] The AP found that the program has heaped additional suffering on thousands of families, including delays that have stretched a decade or more. The Government Accountability Office's report noted how a program established a generation ago to help children injured by government-recommended vaccinations such as measles and chicken pox is now dominated by claims filed by adults who received a flu shot. Those cases typically claim that the adult suffered from Guillain-Barre Syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the nerves. The 'vaccine court' currently operating in the United States is explained in more detail in this outstanding video narrated by actor Rob Schneider : Anyone considering a flu shot should think twice about the risk of harm or death associated with such injections. Far safer and more effective strategies for preventing the flu include vitamin D supplementation, boosting immune function with appropriate herbs, increasing intake of vitamin C during winter months, improving restful sleep, increasing zinc uptake and practicing improved personal hygiene (such as washing your hands before touching food you're about to eat).

0," Election Day may not have turned out nationally as many people may have wished, but a number of local issues, from our perspective, did quite well, and one of them was a measure in San Juan County, Wash., to ban the growing of genetically modified crops. According to local reports, Washington state residents passed Initiative Measure No. 2012-4, which bans the growth of GM foods. The language of the initiative makes it illegal to 'propagate, cultivate, raise or grow plants, animals and other organisms which have been genetically modified' in San Juan County. The measure still permits the growth of hybrid organisms and GMOs grown by healthcare providers and researchers only, as long as they are in secure, controlled environments. The measure will affect mostly local farmers, who were largely supportive of it, according to local reports. The initiative; however, won't affect GMO products sold in local food stores. 'We as citizens deserve a choice' The measure comes with some teeth as well: Violators can be charged with the crime of being a public nuisance and fined for the first offense; second violations will be considered misdemeanors with a third violation a 'gross misdemeanor,' local Fox affiliate q13fox.com reported. One group pushing the initiative, GMO-Free San Juans , said, 'GMO's are a corporate intrusion we can't afford if we seek a healthy food system. We as citizens deserve the choice.' As we've documented here at selfnews , there are numerous problems and issues with GMO foods ; in fact, there is serious concern over whether GM foods are even safe for consumption, which is why we have consistently backed efforts to require labeling of all genetically modified foods. Our concerns are increasingly being shared by millions of other Americans all over the country, spurred in large part by the results of successive studies which have linked the consumption of GM foods to a variety of conditions ranging from organ failure to sterility. Currently, some 80 percent of foods in U.S. grocery stores and markets contain GMO ingredients; as Americans learn more about them, they are pushing, as we are, to get GMO products labeled. 'In most of Europe and other developed countries around the world there are significant restrictions or outright bans on GMOs because they're not considered proven safe,' says The Organic Center blog. 'Approving this initiative would show that the residents of San Juan County are elitists, ignorant of the benefits of technological advances, and uncaring about the planet and its inhabitants,' opponents of the initiative argued, according to the San Juan County voter's guide. Growing demand for labeling In June, ABC News reported that 90 percent of Americans - a near-unanimous figure - approve of GMO labeling. 'Such near-unanimity in public opinion is rare,' said the report. In addition, 57 percent said they would be less likely to buy foods that are labeled as genetically modified, the survey - conducted exclusively for ABC News - found. Therein lies the rub for food companies; by labeling their products, they would actually be steering consumers away from their GM food products and commodities. 'The image problem of genetically modified food is underscored by contrast to organic foods. While only five percent of Americans say they'd be more likely to buy a food labeled as genetically modified, 52 percent say they'd be more likely to buy food that's labeled as having been raised organically,' said the news service. What's more, the survey found that GM foods are especially unpopular among women; that's a problem in and of itself, since women do most of the family shopping. Nearly two-thirds of women - 62 percent - believe GM foods are unsafe. Women disagree with men on this by a two to one margin.

0," The article which originally appeared here has been removed because it is no longer aligned with the science-based investigative mission of selfnews. In late 2013 / early 2014, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger), editor of selfnews, transitioned from outspoken activist to environmental scientist. He now runs the selfnews Forensic Food Lab, conducting world-class food science research and publishing scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through scientific investigation powered by university-level analytical instrumentation, Adams found that, much like the majority of the population, he had been suffering over the past several years from chronic exposure to cumulative toxic elements found in the food supply, including in many organics and 'superfoods.' His findings -- as well as breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, protective food nutrients and the cognitive influences of food contaminants -- are being published at selfnews.com. Notably, Adams found that exposure to toxic elements in foods altered his mindset, outlook on life and degree of happiness in the world. 'I now know that much of my outlook on the world was being negatively shaped by toxic elements found not just in everyday foods, but also in some superfoods and dietary supplements,' Adams now explains. Adams spent much of 2013 painstakingly testing his food intake for the presence of toxic elements, then taking therapeutic steps to eliminate those toxic elements from his body. 'After about six months of intense detoxification, I experienced a sudden, involuntary shift in my worldview. Fear transformed into a sense of calm. Uncertainty was replaced by inspiration. I felt a new sense of awakening and optimism combined with a strong desire to contribute meaningful knowledge to humanity,' Adams explains. As part of this transformation, Adams felt himself drawn into the realm of scientific investigations and analytical chemistry. He spent an intense six months studying university-level chemistry and learning methodologies of atomic spectroscopy , a technology used to quantitatively assess metals, minerals, toxic elements and radioactive isotopes found in all foods, beverages, soils and physical matter. By the end of 2013, Adams had completed extensive training in laboratory instrumentation and high-level chemistry, and he now operates ICP-MS atomic spectroscopy instrumentation which he uses to conduct world-class investigative research on foods, beverages and personal care products such as cosmetics. The ICP-MS instrument he uses is capable of detecting toxic elements at parts per trillion concentrations. His current research not only covers toxic elements but also radioactive isotopes and the global contamination of the food supply with fallout from nearly 70 years of atomic bomb testing. He has begun intensive research on the radioactive contamination of ocean foods from the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, and he has developed unique scientific methologies surrounding the detection and interpretation of data involving radioactive isotopes such as Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Uranium-235. Focused on food science solutions for humanity The Health Ranger's research is now focused on helping save humanity from toxic elements in foods and the environment, including food toxins, water toxins, GMO toxins, pesticides and herbicides, radioactive elements from nuclear accidents and nuclear testing, contaminated soils, adulterated foods and more. Through this research, Adams developed several breakthrough discoveries in food technology, toxicology and nutrition, and he has authored several scientific papers which are being published in 2014. 'Each of these discoveries has the potential to not just save millions of lives across the globe,' Adams explains, 'but to radically reshape the future of human civilization in a positive direction free from war, poisons and environmental destruction.' His new mission is to freely share his discoveries with the world so that humanity can heal from what he calls 'a century of industrial contamination that has driven the human race into a self-intoxicating spiral of clinical insanity.' Mike Adams (aka the 'Health Ranger') is also the executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center ( www.ConsumerWellness.org ), an organization which has already awarded tens of thousands of dollars worth of grants around the world for prenatal nutrition and children's nutrition programs. Click here to see some of the CWC's success stories . Once an outspoken critic and activist, Adams now sees far greater potential in scientific discovery and problem solving. 'One of the things that came out of my own personal healing from toxic element contamination was a rewened, almost hyper-magnified sense of compassion for fellow human beings. Coupled with that, I was blessed with the cognitive capacities needed to discover a new paradigm of scientific knowledge that can help end suffering and eradicate much of the degenerative disease, mental illness and behavioral violence that currently plagues humankind. My deepest desire is to share this knowledge with the world and show others how to use it to heal their minds and bodies, their families, their communities, their nations and ultimately our fragile civilization.' 'Everything is at stake. If we do not change course, human civilization will not survive its own poisoning,' Adams warns. 'But now, thanks to these extraordinary discoveries, we have a blueprint for a way out that can put humankind back on a path of abundance, sanity, health, happiness, cooperation rather than conflict, and accelerated awakening of human consciousness and scientific progress.'

0," As terrifying as a diagnosis of cancer can be, stories of individuals taking their health into their own hands, and defeating so-called 'terminal' illness through natural methods are common. Whether using a strict raw vegan or traditional vegetarian diet, Gerson therapy or macrobiotics, these former cancer patients beat the odds and are living vibrant, healthy lives. Food as medicine At one point or another, most of us have come across an encouraging story of someone who lived to tell the tale of refusing conventional cancer therapy, and instead opting for a natural healing protocol. Even though each method may differ in approach, all tend to have one element in common, namely, a nutrient dense, cleansing diet. For some, raw juices are the key. For others, sea vegetables and grains. Regardless of the method, one thing is certain: a clean diet is powerful medicine. 'If you don't do chemotherapy, you're insane' Chris was diagnosed with colon cancer in his late twenties. After having part of his colon surgically removed, along with a golf ball-sized tumor, he was told by his doctor there wasn't anything specific he should do to keep healthy - except keep in mind that most cancer patients only have a five-year survival rate. When Chris subsequently refused chemotherapy, his doctor thought he was 'insane.' After plenty of research and prayer, Chris decided to take the road less traveled, and ditch the conventional treatments for alternative medicine - specifically, a 100 percent raw vegan diet . As a reward for his unconventional choice, Chris has been free of cancer for over eight years. You can learn more about Chris's journey here . Only a few weeks left to live Janet was 45 years old when she discovered that she was terminally ill with stage IV lung cancer. A registered nurse, Janet chose chemotherapy, but due to severe side-effects, she discontinued the treatment after only one dose. She was then advised by her primary care physician to research macrobiotics . Janet decided to give it a try and hired a macrobiotic consultant/cooking coach, who taught her about the protocol. Before long, Janet's test results began improving. And then her tumors completely disappeared. Six years later, she is still cancer-free and continues to embrace a macrobiotic way of life. Janet's full story can be found here . 'Nutrition won't hurt, but it won't help' Diagnosed with mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Joyce had a football-sized tumor on the left side of her body that weighed five pounds. Told by her doctors she had a three-year survival rate, and that chemotherapy would not cure the cancer, Joyce turned to nutrition and chose a Gerson diet . Soon after, even though her doctors said nutrition wouldn't help, they advised her to continue whatever she was doing. Joyce cured her cancer and now lives an energetic, healthy life with her family. Watch Joyce's story here . A turning point Elena's doctors predictably recommended chemotherapy when she was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer. Just as she was about to begin conventional treatments, her mother called Charlotte Gerson, who convinced her to try alternative therapies instead.

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Saturated fats, often also referred to as bad fats or unhealthy fats, have unfortunately become a significant part of the average modern day diet. And a study recently published in Cancer Research has added to their long list of negative health effects. It revealed that a high intake of saturated fats increases one's risk of developing cancer of the small intestines. Details of Study Even though the small intestines make up the majority of the entire digestive tract, the development of cancer there is relatively uncommon. Thus, previous research on the effects of eating red and processed meats had largely centered on colorectal cancer. This is said to be the first prospective study for small intestine cancer. The study had looked at data collected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AARP Diet and Health Study. According to Wikipedia, AARP is an organization which is widely known for addressing issues that affect older Americans. It used to be called the American Association of Retired Persons, but its name was changed to the letters 'AARP' in 1999 in order to reflect the fact that its focus had broadened beyond just American retirees. In all, information on 294,707 men and 199,293 women was analyzed. They had filled in a diet questionnaire back in 1995, which included information on meat and fat intake, after which the participants were tracked by the NIH-AARP study either up till 2003, until they were diagnosed with cancer, or until they passed on. The median follow-up period of the study was 7.5 years. Findings of Study The study found that those with the highest intake of saturated fat were 3.18 times more likely to develop carcinoid tumors in the small intestines, as compared to those with the lowest intake of the bad fats. That is a massive elevation in risk. No statistically significant association was, however, found between the consumption of red or processed meats with cancer of the small intestines. Even then, it must be noted that red and processed meats had, in previous studies, been linked with increased risk for other cancers, such as those of the colon, rectum, stomach and esophagus. The findings of this study are important because, while still relatively rare, small intestine cancer figures have been rising since the 1970s. 'Identifying modifiable risk factors for cancer of the small intestine is important not only because the incidence of this cancer is on the rise, but it may enable us to further understand other gastrointestinal malignancies,' said Amanda Cross, the National Cancer Institute researcher who led the study. As it is, the list of diseases which saturated fats are guilty of contributing to is already rather long. Separate studies have linked the consumption of saturated fats to many diseases including, among others: various cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), coronary heart disease and heart attacks; unhealthy cholesterol levels; strokes; as well as cancers, including breast cancer and colon cancer. Now, small intestine cancer can also be added to that danger list. That is one more reason for us to reduce consumption of foods high in these bad fats , including red meat, processed meat, dairy, cheese and butter.

0," The progressive California town of Berkeley has passed a new resolution mandating that the safety information typically buried deep within the fine print of mobile phone user manuals instead be emblazoned as a prominent safety warning that consumers will actually notice and acknowledge. The Guardian reports that Berkeley lawmakers crafted the resolution to address what they see as 'an important right-to-know issue,' contending that key safety information warning users about cancer and other health risks associated with mobile phone use is typically too obscure for the average person to understand. As it currently stands, most wireless-capable devices like smartphones already carry Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated safety warnings about how far a mobile device should be kept away from the body to avoid injury. The official recommendation is that most devices remain at a distance of 5 to 25 millimeters away from the skin to limit radiation exposure. Most users don't know about these warnings because they're often hidden in the fine print of circumlocutory instruction manuals that are obnoxiously abstruse. The goal is to make accessing this already-provided safety information simpler so that consumers can make safe, smart choices about how they use their mobile phones. 'To assure safety, the Federal Government requires that cell phones meet radio frequency (RF) exposure guidelines,' reads the mandated safety information warning. 'If you carry or use your phone in a pants or shirt pocket or tucked into a bra when the phone is ON and connected to a wireless network, you may exceed the federal guidelines for exposure to RF radiation.' 'This potential risk is greater for children. Refer to the instructions in your phone or user manual for information about how to use your phone safely.' 190 scientists from 39 countries affirm that mobile phones increase the risk of cellular stress, genetic damage and cancer The mandate came about after a poll of Berkeley residents found that 66 percent of respondents who regularly carry mobile phones in their pockets reported being unaware of the FCC's safety guidelines concerning the dangers associated with keeping one's mobile phone too close to the body. '... while 74% of respondents carried their phones in a pocket -- considered close contact -- 66% were unaware that cell phone manufacturers recommend the products be carried away from the body or used in conjunction with hands-free devices,' explains The Guardian . 'The Berkeley ordinance would require sellers to post the safety information in public view and hand out a separate flyer to buyers who purchase or lease a phone.' There's nothing all that novel about the requirement other than the fact that it reiterates what the FCC has already determined concerning mobile phone safety. CTIA - The Wireless Association, a trade organization that represents key wireless industry players, has condemned the move as failing to provide information 'grounded in science or sound policy.' CTIA has an agenda to promote the interests of wireless carriers, phone manufacturers and others within the industry that face increased scrutiny if more users become aware of the proven dangers associated with mobile devices. This industry group, along with various others, hold heavy influence over media and government when it comes to how much the public is told about cell phone risks. The fact of the matter is that the mandated warning is based on sound science, contrary to what CTIA claims, and an open letter penned by 190 scientists from 39 countries reiterates this. 'Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines,' reads the letter, which calls for the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) to conduct an impartial study on the subject. 'Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans.'

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Love grapes? Hate heart disease risk factors? Here's good news for you: University of Michigan Cardiovascular research suggests eating grapes could lower blood pressure, help heal signs of heart muscle damage and improve heart function. Just published in the October issue of the Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences , the study concludes grapes potentially could dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The reason? The scientists think it's most likely due to the high level of naturally occurring antioxidants called phytochemicals present in grapes. Phytochemicals have consistently been shown in other studies, including earlier University of Michigan research, to reduce potentially harmful cell-damaging free radical activity in the body. Although the study was performed in laboratory rats bred especially to have salt-sensitive high blood pressure, the researchers note their findings are very encouraging for people. Their data adds more evidence to a quickly accumulating body of knowledge about the health benefits of grapes. 'These findings support our theory that something within the grapes themselves has a direct impact on cardiovascular risk, beyond the simple blood pressure-lowering impact that we already know can come from a diet rich in fruits and vegetables,' said Mitchell Seymour, M.S., in a statement to the media. Seymour led the research as part of his doctoral work in nutrition science at Michigan State University and manages the University of Michigan Cardioprotection Research Laboratory. The scientists looked at the effect of a blend of powdered green, red, and black table grapes that were mixed into the rats' diet. Then they compared the rats that ate the grape powder-laden meals with control rats who didn't have any grapes, including some animals who received a small dose of a commonly prescribed blood-pressure medication called hydrazine. After 18 weeks, the rats that ate the grape-enriched food had lower blood pressure, better heart function, reduced inflammation throughout their bodies, and far less signs of heart muscle damage than the rats fed the otherwise same salty diet but without grapes. What's more, the rats that received hydrazine with a salty diet also had lower blood pressure but, significantly, their hearts were not protected from damage like those in the grape-supplemented group. Bottom line: Grapes offered cardioprotective benefits while a widely used drug did not. In the press statement, University of Michigan heart surgeon Steven Bolling, M.D., said the rats in the study were not so different from millions of Americans who also have high blood pressure related to diet and who often develop heart failure because of prolonged hypertension. 'The inevitable downhill sequence to hypertension and heart failure was changed by the addition of grape powder to a high-salt diet,' stated Bolling, who is professor of cardiac surgery at the University of Medical School and also heads the University of Michigan Cardioprotection Research Laboratory. 'Although there are many natural compounds in the grape powder itself that may have an effect, the things that we think are having an effect against the hypertension may be the flavanoids -- either by direct antioxidant effects, by indirect effects on cell function, or both. These flavanoids are rich in all parts of the grape, including the skin, flesh and seed.'

0," Defenders of the Common Core education standards, including GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush and most of the Democratic candidates, are quick to point out that rather than a centralized sneak attack on states' rights, the standards were themselves the product of states . Born of an initiative stemming from former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano during her tenure as Arizona governor and head of the National Governor's Association, the standards are 'nothing short of an exhaustive and collaborative years-long effort aimed at raising the achievement levels of students across the country,' according to U.S. News & World Report . In other words, states themselves and not the federal Department of Education came up with them. That might be true, but to insist that the federal government has played no role in pushing these standards is simply false. The same is true for a number of large corporations. Blatant admission As noted by The Daily Sheeple , angry teachers and frustrated parents were still reeling from the Bush-era education boondoggle known as 'No Child Left Behind' when suddenly and from nowhere, 'Common Core' appeared. As reported by Dr. Susan Berry writing at Breitbart News , the Department of Education's fingerprints are all over this push. She writes: In a remarkable admission, the former director of the Race to the Top (RttT) competitive grant program and chief of staff to U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan says the federal government 'forced' full support for adoption of the Common Core standards from each state by requiring its governor, chief state school officer, and head of the state board of education to sign off on the grant application. Joanne Weiss, who now works as an 'independent education consultant,' wrote in the Stanford Social Innovation Review , an academic publication, that the RttT grant program funded via President Obama's 2009 trillion-dollar slush fund program (misnamed the 'Stimulus' bill) under the guise of helping low income, poor-performing schools 'offers lessons in high-impact grantmaking that are applicable not only in education but also in other fields.' She further writes: The Department of Education runs about 150 competitions every year. But among those programs, Race to the Top stands out. It had more than $4 billion to allocate to competition winners, and it attracted the participation of nearly every state in the union. It arguably drove more change in education at the state, district, and school levels than any federal competition had previously been able to achieve. The leader of RttT from its beginning, Weiss goes on to explain that a federal agency had essentially made the decision to take advantage of states' poor financial position during the recession. '[S]o the large pot of funding that we had to offer was a significant inducement for states to compete,' she wrote, adding the surprise number of 46 states willing to agree to adopting Common Core was tied to 'our decision to leverage the spirit of competition.' No role? Competition, however, is a much different concept than 'bribery' or even 'blackmail,' yet her essay pretty much admits the Department of Education manipulated cash-strapped states into accepting the standards. Writing at The Pulse 2016 , Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles in Action, argued that Weiss' admission proves the Education Department 'was actively coercing states, in blatant violation of constitutional principles of federalism, from the earliest days of Common Core.' Further, she told Breitbart News that the admission discounts any 2016 presidential contender's claim that Common Core was purely a product of the states. 'The former director of the Race to the Top program has admitted a remarkable level of coercion in 'persuading' states to adopt federally preferred education policies Common Core standards, aligned assessments, accountability systems, and personnel policies,' said Robbins. 'Not only did the states have to toe the line in all these areas to have a shot at the much-coveted federal money, but they had to alter their own decision-making structures to comply with federal dictates.' She went on to point out that the Constitution does not give the federal government any role in local education. Sources include: USNews.com TheDailySheeple.com Breitbart.com ThePulse2016.com "
0," Repeated exposure to the low blood sugar levels caused by poorly controlled diabetes may damage the brain's cognitive function, according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Edinburgh and presented at a conference of the nonprofit Diabetes U.K. 'This study reinforces previous evidence which suggests that poorly controlled diabetes affects the functioning of the brain,' said Iain Frame of Diabetes U.K. 'We already know that Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which is a type of dementia, and this research adds another piece to a very complex jigsaw puzzle.' Type 2 diabetes is marked by unusually high blood sugar levels due to the body's acquired insensitivity to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin. Excessive doses of insulin or other diabetes drugs may push blood sugar levels too low, resulting in a hypoglycemic episode -- or 'hypo' -- in which the brain is starved of the glucose it needs to function. Symptoms of hypos include blurred vision, dizziness, elevated heart rate, hunger, fatigue, sweating and weakness. Researchers tested 1,066 Type 2 diabetes patients between the ages of 60 and 75 on various cognitive abilities including concentration, logic and memory. They found that the 113 participants who had experienced severe hypos in the past scored significantly lower on tests of vocabulary and general mental ability. Lead researcher Jackie Price noted that the study was correlative, and could not prove whether hypos caused the lessened cognitive ability. 'Either hypos lead to cognitive decline, or cognitive decline makes it more difficult for people to manage their diabetes , which in turn causes more hypos,' Price said. 'A third explanation could be that a third unidentified factor is causing both the hypos and the cognitive decline.' According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 171 million people around the world are diabetic, with the number set to double by 2030. In the United States, 24 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, 5.7 million are undiagnosed and 57 million are prediabetic. Sources for this story include: news.bbc.co.uk. "
0," Yorktown, Virginia, where George Washington's decisive victory won American independence from the British, is the scene of the latest skirmish over property and farming rights. Eighty neighborhoods historically zoned agriculturally are being reviewed for rezoning at the behest of a small group of residents who don't approve of a couple of home-based oyster farms. On Wednesday, May 14, over 100 property rights and local foods activists staged a Pitchfork Protest at the York County Planning Commission. Greg Garrett and Anthony Bavuso are the two oyster farm owners whose livelihoods are threatened by the controversy. Both are now members of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund (FTCLDF), which is working to support the two farms and defend their rights. The FTCLDF's mission is to preserve access to locally produced, nutrient-dense foods. Both Garrett and Bavuso, and some of their nearest neighbors, claim that their small-scale farms have a minimal impact on the neighborhood. They also contend that the oysters are cleaning the bay and are thus an ecological plus for the community. Oysters contain powerful nutrition; they are full of vitamins A, B, C and D, protein and zinc. Zinc is an important mineral found most abundantly in oysters. Nutrition scientist Chris Masterjohn said, 'Vitamins A, D, and K2 interact synergistically to support immune health, provide for adequate growth, support strong bones and teeth, and protect soft tissues from calcification. ... [V]itamins A and D can only fulfill their functions in the presence of adequate zinc.' Interestingly, the neighbors most interested in having these oysters as a regular part of their diet are strong supporters of Bavuso and Garrett. At the Planning Commission meeting, 23 people testified in support of the farms and against the county officials' attempt to prohibit them; 16 testified against the farms and in favor of the proposed zoning change. 'This is the first of several meetings, and we feel confident that more people who would be negatively affected by rezoning will come out and express their opposition,' said Garrett. As home-based businesses and home churches become more popular, zoning officials are increasingly using the tool of special-use permits to appease the not-in-my-neighborhood crowd. A recent article in USA Today described the use of special-use permits to give neighbors a chance to hold sway over the use of homes in their neighborhood as short-term vacation rentals. And Virginia's most populous county is currently considering rules to restrict gatherings in private homes. Virginia is a Right-to-Farm state with laws on the books which prevent cities and counties from requiring special-use permits in agricultural districts. The state legislature recently sided by overwhelming margins with the oyster farms of York County by clarifying the law to include aquaculture. The revised law goes into effect January 1, 2015. That hasn't deterred the county officials. The downzoning of York County to residential use only would mean that the oyster farms would have to go.

0," A newly issued report by a U.S. senator found that more than 1,000 U.S. veterans likely died in the past decade because of malpractice in regard to a lack of proper and timely care from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical centers. The report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., himself a physician, 'aggregates government investigations and media reports to trace a history of fraudulent scheduling practices, budget mismanagement, insufficient oversight and lack of accountability that have led to the current controversy plaguing the VA,' CNN reported. CNN was the first to break the story that some U.S. military veterans had died after being placed on a 'secret waiting list' at the VA medical center in Phoenix. Poor management is costing billions The VA has since admitted that 23 patients died awaiting care that was delayed months, but Coburn's report titled 'Friendly Fire: Death, Delay and Dismay at the VA' reveals that many more deaths have been linked to system-wide failures at VA hospitals and clinics all over the country. Coburn stated that if the VA's budget had been handled properly and the correct management put in place, many of those deaths could have been avoided. 'Over the past decade, more than 1,000 veterans may have died as a result of VA malfeasance,' Coburn, who has survived three bouts with cancer, said. He believes the government should offer veterans access to private-sector hospitals and clinics. 'Poor management is costing the department billions of dollars more and compromising veterans' access to medical care,' he said. Malpractice suits, office remodeling, bonuses Coburn's office said that the VA has allocated some $20 billion since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to a number of non-health-related projects, such as office remodels, unused software licenses, undocumented government debit card purchases, the funding of call centers that received just 2.4 calls per day on average and bonuses for top officials, including administrators of the facilities where vets died waiting for care. As CNN reported: 'In 2013, four VA construction projects in Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans cost an extra $1.5 billion because of scheduling delays and excessive expenditures, the report shows. 'Additional funds have been funneled into legal settlements. Since 2001, the VA has paid about $845 million in malpractice costs, of which $36.4 million was used to settle claims involving delayed health care.' Additional scrutiny has been applied to the VA's budget following revelations about the controversial bonus system payments; they allegedly created incentives for administrators and managers to hide the fact that patients had to wait months for care. At a recent congressional hearing, VA Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration Gina Farrisee confirmed that 78% of senior VA managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 (fiscal years run from Oct. 1 - Sept. 30), despite the malpractice and treatment delay controversies. Here's one of the more egregious examples: 'Former VA Regional Director Michael Moreland received a $63,000 bonus in 2013 for infection prevention policies, for example, but the VA's Office of Inspector General concluded that his policies failed. Moreland presided over the Pittsburgh VA, where an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease killed six veterans in 2011 and 2012.' In addition, Coburn's report identified crimes that had been committed by VA staff, such as drug dealing, theft and sexual abuse of patients. The incidents spanned the past several years. The requirements are so low Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said in a news conference in Washington in mid-June that he will be removing more VA officials from their positions after he receives more information from the VA Inspector General's Office. However, it's clear the VA's problems are much more systemic and, honestly, successive congresses and White House administrations share the blame. The VA system is like all government-run systems and agencies : There have always been too few resources allocated for the function the agency was created to perform; the incentive to cheat is strong (bonuses in amounts that surpass what 85% of Americans earn in a year); too little real oversight; and an institutionalized bureaucracy that is more concerned about self-preservation than anything else. Some names and positions might change, but the real answer -- getting government out of the healthcare business altogether -- won't. Coburn -- who said he wasn't surprised by his report -- knows; he was trained in a VA hospital. 'The culture in the VA should be people working for veterans, not for the VA, [but] the culture right now is that I work for a system ... and the requirements are so low,' he told Politico . "
0," U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa has contacted health officials in 34 states to see if they are imposing any accountability on doctors who over-prescribe dangerous prescription drugs. In 2010, Grassley wrote to officials in all 50 states requesting statistics on doctors who prescribed antipsychotics, anti-anxiety drugs and painkillers to Medicaid patients at the highest rates. In the most recent letters, Grassley inquired of 34 states whether these top prescribers have been investigated in any way. He also asked a number of other questions, including whether the doctors are still eligible for Medicaid reimbursement, whether they have been reviewed to state medical boards for investigation, and whether any systems have been set up to track and prevent over-prescribing of dangerous drugs. 'These types of drugs have addictive properties, and the potential for fraud and abuse by prescribers and patients is extremely high,' Grassley wrote in Monday's letters. 'When these drugs are prescribed to Medicaid patients, it is the American people who pay the price for over-prescription, abuse, and fraud.' Grassley, who is the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has made greater health care transparency one of his signature causes. In addition to having high abuse potential, the drugs singled out in Grassley's letters are some of the biggest costs in Medicaid drug spending. In addition to the 34 letters, Grassley is sending an additional 12 to the states that never responded to his 2010 inquiry. The remaining four states provided enough information to the first letter that Grassley has not deemed any followup necessary. Since the initial letters were sent, Arizona, Louisiana, New York and Oklahoma have all removed some of their top-prescribing doctors from Medicaid, while California has placed restrictions on as many as 20 doctors. 'Shocking' Numbers Some of the responses to Grassley's 2010 inquiry are astonishing. For example, Maine's top prescriber of the painkiller Oxycontin wrote nearly twice as many prescriptions for the drug (1,867) as the next-highest prescriber. The same doctor also wrote nearly three times as many prescriptions for the painkiller Roxicodone as the second-highest prescriber. Ohio's top prescriber of the antipsychotic Abilify issued 13,825 prescriptions for the drug in 2009, an average of 54 every single weekday! But the top prescriber of the antipsychotic Seroquel blew those numbers out of the water, issuing 18,890 prescriptions, or an average of nine per hour. These Medicaid-funded prescription binges cost Ohio taxpayers $6.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively. 'After an extensive review of prescribing habits of the serial prescribers of pain and mental-health drugs in Ohio, I have concerns about the oversight and enforcement of Medicaid abuse in your state,' Grassley wrote. 'While I am sensitive to the concerns of misinterpretation of the data you provided, the numbers themselves are quite shocking.' Prescription epidemic dwarfs illegal drug abuse Health experts are increasingly warning that prescription drug abuse now dwarfs abuse of illegal 'street' drugs. For example, an analysis of nearly 200,000 Florida autopsies conducted in 2007 showed that three times as many people died from legal drugs than from cocaine, heroine and methamphetamine use combined. 'The abuse has reached epidemic proportions,' said Lisa McElhaney, a sergeant in the pharmaceutical drug diversion unit of the Broward County Sheriff's Office. 'It's just explosive.' Yet rather than reigning in Big Pharma , the government continues to pour money into the failed 'drug war,' which has led only to higher crime rates while often actually increasing the availability of street drugs. That's why in June 2011, a group of prominent former world leaders called for a shift to treating all drug abuse as a health problem rather than a criminal one. "
0," The concern about MSG and glutamates in the food supply has hit a new all-time high since Codex Alimentarium rules are being enforced. Codex, through the WHO and WTO (World Trade Organization) creates the standards by which foods can be 'legally' adulterated. When I attended meetings in Bonn, German and Rome in 2004 and 2005, and wrote about them in Death by Modern Medicine , it was very clear that developing countries were trying to enforce the maximum levels of toxins allowed in foods without acknowledging health side effects. Regarding glutamates, L-glutamic acid (glutamate) has been accepted as a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) substitute for salt and can be added to any prepared food. This means a product labeled 'Low Sodium' can contain L- glutamic acid (the amino acid that forms MSG) and does not have to be labeled. Let's review MSG, glutamic acid, glutamate, glutamine, and gluten. They are all related and we mix them up all the time. I'd like to present the case that if we would only mix them with magnesium, our health would improve. 1. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid. MSG is primarily used as a taste enhancer; however, it doesn't just affect the tongue. When MSG reaches the brain, it can produce an MSG rush with flushing, headaches, scalp tension, migraine and seizures. MSG also lowers the pain threshold for people with chronic pain, headaches and fibromyalgia. This can occur in susceptible people. Who are those susceptible people? Those with magnesium deficiency. Low levels of methylated B6 and taurine can also contribute to symptoms of MSG 'poisoning.' 2. Glutamic acid is an amino acid that acts as a primary neurotransmitter in neural activation. Glutamic acid is found in most foods with high amounts in gluten grains: wheat, barley, rye (25%), soy (40%), legumes, peanuts, dairy (20%), nuts, seeds, meats and non-gluten grains quinoa, amaranth, tapioca, millet, flax and sorghum. It turns out that food sources of glutamic acid can do the very same thing as MSG in sensitive people; they simply take longer to reach the brain. MSG reaches the brain in 15-30 minutes; in susceptible people, it takes 4-6 hours for glutamate from digested food to arrive. That can explain the 4-6 hour timing from a meal to a seizure; or someone who has insomnia in the middle of the night 4-6 hours after a late dinner. Specifically, when these food sources of glutamic acid are digested and lose a hydrogen atom, glutamate is produced. Glutamic acid is mostly found as glutamate in the body. Also, note that glutamic acid, along with aspartic acid, is an ingredients in aspartame, which causes almost 100 side effects. 3. Glutamate is an amino acid critical for brain function and metabolism and the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter. It is found in meat, fish milk, cheese, mushrooms and many vegetables. Internally, the body can produce its own glutamate from other amino acids. Levels of glutamate are kept under control by glutamate transporters that function to remove glutamate from outside of the cells. At times of brain injury or disease, excess glutamate can accumulate which opens up NMDA cell channels allowing calcium to enter the cells causing neuron damage and cell death. Such a process is called excitotoxicity and is associated with stroke, autism, ALS, Alzheimer's and memory loss. Glutamate channels are controlled by magnesium. 4. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Most glutamine is made and stored in muscles and lung tissue. Glutamine helps protect the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. For that reason, some researchers have suggested that people who have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) may not have enough glutamine. However, 2 clinical trials found that taking glutamine supplements did not improve symptoms of Crohn's disease. My friend, Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon who wrote the book Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills says that glutamine itself is not a problem. However, high doses of the single amino acid glutamine will be converted into glutamate. Then, as I'll discuss below, a person who is low in magnesium will be unable to prevent glutamate from flooding into unprotected brain cells. 5. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Gluten is approximately 25% glutamic acid by weight and casein is 20% glutamic acid by chemical structure. Soy is richer than bothin this amino acid. By now you know that glutamic acid will be converted very quickly into glutamate. How do we go about protecting ourselves from the glutamates? MSG is difficult to avoid if you eat processed foods. Glutamate and glutamic acid are considered GRAS substitutes for salt. As mentioned above, glutamic acid and glutamate in food can be metabolized into the equivalent of MSG and reach the brain - it just takes longer and makes it harder to track the cause of your brain rush. Of course, all this sounds very scary since these amino acids are in so many foods - it's impossible to avoid them. But what people don't factor into the equation is the role of magnesium in the function of brain neurotransmitters. The Magnesium Solution Here's what the very popular Psychology Today says about Magnesium: The Original Chill Pill . 'Magnesium hangs out in the synapse between two neurons along with calcium and glutamate...calcium and glutamate are excitatory, and in excess, toxic. They activate the NMDA receptor. Magnesium can sit on the NMDA receptor without activating it, like a guard at the gate. Therefore, if we are deficient in magnesium, there's no guard. Calcium and glutamate can activate the receptor like there is no tomorrow. In the long term, this damages the neurons, eventually leading to cell death. In the brain, that is not an easy situation to reverse or remedy.' I've written about the natural calcium-channel blocking action of magnesium, which protects the heart. Now I'm focusing on glutamate-blocking to protect the brain. Many studies echo the Psychology Today summary of magnesium's role in glutamate inhibition. Wikipedia shared the following: 'Excessive synaptic receptor stimulation by glutmate is directly related to many conditions. Magnesium is one of many antagonists at the glutamate receptor, and magnesium deficiencies have demonstrated relationships with many glutamate receptor-related conditions.' In the journal, Magnesium Research we learn that: 'Magnesium decreases the intensity of some drug-induced dependencies (e.g. opiates, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine, ethanol, etc.). The main mechanism involved is a decreasing activity of central glutamatergic synapses, especially those involved in the reward system.' It is true that wheat has been hybridized, increasing the gluten content and glutamates are used in processed foods and we are using too many drugs - prescription and street drugs. However, I think we are also becoming more gluten-sensitive, glutamate-sensitive and drug-sensitive because we are collectively and epidemically very magnesium deficient. Eighty percent of the American population obtains below-RDA levels of magnesium. It is widely promoted by magnesium experts and researchers that we should be ingesting twice the RDA of magnesium. I believe that the solution to 'food sensitivity' is not to avoid more and more foods but to enhance the body's ability to handle these foods. Well-absorbed magnesium, multiple minerals and sea salt in your drinking water help the underlying structure, function and electrical activity of your body and allow your body to adapt to your environment and your diet. More is involved, of course, but begin with magnesium and then fill in the gaps with probiotics, methylated B vitamins and taurine once you are saturated with magnesium. A recent client of mine in his 20's has high glutamate levels. Neurologists know that glutamate opens up calcium channels causing nerve cells to fire.Overstimulated nerve cells can excite themselves to death if too much stimulatory glutamate is present. My client is on a seizure medication that is designed to block glutamate receptors. But it doesn't. What his neurologists don't know is that magnesium is a natural glutamate blocker. Magnesium is the mineral the nervous system uses to switch off overtaxed nerve cells. About the author: About the Author: Carolyn Dean MD ND is The Doctor of the Future.

0," The cholesterol theory of atherosclerotic disease is one of the biggest medical hoaxes of our time, as is the widespread administration of statin drugs as 'treatment' for high cholesterol. Published science has verified that lowering cholesterol with statins does absolutely nothing to prevent coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular events, while at the same time increasing users' risk of dementia and death. The real problem is a buildup of calcium in the arteries caused not by cholesterol but by systemic inflammation that causes cholesterol to act in ways that are sometimes damaging to the circulatory system. Lowering cholesterol, in other words, targets the symptom of a much greater root cause, which Dr. Jeffrey Dach, M.D., explains can be effectively treated through the consumption of aged garlic. He recently published a powerful report on the benefits of aged garlic, which has been shown in multiple published studies to reduce coronary calcium buildup and even eliminate it in some cases. It turns out that statins don't actually do this; instead, they act only to deprive patients of much-needed cholesterol, which is food for the brain, and they can even increase the progression of calcium buildup. Citing extensive research compiled by Dr. William R. Ware, Ph.D., a faculty member at the University of Ontario in Canada, Dr. Dach highlights a series of studies showing that statin treatment offers no improvements for patients' calcium scores; in some cases, it actually worsens it. At least five separate randomized, controlled studies, as of the year 2010, reveal that statins do not reduce patients' coronary calcium scores. Aged garlic, on the other hand, does reduce coronary calcium scores, as evidenced by a series of studies published during the same time in various other journals. For example, one study published in the Journal of Nutrition back in 2006 found that patients assigned to take 4 milliliters of aged garlic (1,200 milligrams of KYOLIC Aged Garlic Liquid) showed only a 7.5 percent progression of calcium score after the first year, compared to 22.2 percent progression in the placebo group. Another study published in Preventive Medicine in 2009 showed similar benefits from taking aged garlic, especially when supplemented with vitamins B12, B6, folate and the amino acid l-arginine. After one year of treatment, patients in the garlic and nutrient group saw a 6.8 percent progression in calcium score compared to 26.5 percent in the placebo group. In 2010, the results of a randomized trial published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Research found that calcium scores progressed much more slowly in patients taking aged garlic and other synergistic nutrients compared to patients who were taking only statins and a placebo. 'As we can see from the ... studies, statin drugs are quite effective for lowering cholesterol, yet fail to reduce or slow progression of calcium score,' writes Dr. Dach. 'Again, this provides even more evidence falsifying the cholesterol theory of atherosclerotic heart disease.' Garlic helps improve gut health and prevent atherosclerotic plaque and 'biofilm' Other benefits of consuming garlic include protection against harmful microbes and the destruction of atherosclerotic plaque and 'biofilm.' Unlike conventional antibiotics, garlic's antimicrobial activity targets only harmful microbes, making it one of nature's superior antibiotic foods. Garlic also targets arterial plaque buildup, or what is now commonly referred to as 'biofilm.' 'Bacterial biofilms are far more resistant than individual bacteria to the armories of antibiotics we have devised to combat them,' explains the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), referencing a study published in the May 2012 issue of the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy that found that key components of garlic help prevent biofilm, or matrices of harmful bacteria, from forming within the body. ASM notes that the researchers involved in this important study 'pinpointed a constituent of garlic that attacks a key step in the development of biofilms.'

0," It's happening all around the world, and emerging research suggests that the environmental impact of its use is absolutely devastating: geoengineering, a man-made climate control scheme marked by criss-crossing air sweeps that leave behind streams of shimmering 'chemtrail' debris across our skies, is now being linked to widespread drought and famine throughout the world, not to mention the complete breakdown of Earth's agricultural systems. Geoengineering expert Dane Wigington of GeoengineeringWatch.org says chemtrail operations represent the 'greatest single source of damage on many fronts,' and he might just be right. In some areas of the world, persistent drought conditions brought about by artificial weather manipulation have led to massive reductions in crop output and ever-dwindling fresh water supplies. In Mongolia, for example, an astounding 80 percent reduction in crop yields is the direct result of persistent drought conditions, suggests Wigington. Similarly, in Thailand, farmers are struggling to produce enough food as water supplies dry up. In some areas, military soldiers are having to protect what little water remains at gunpoint. A little closer to home, California and many areas of the Pacific Northwest continue to hobble through epic drought conditions that have left many formerly flourishing crop fields completely bone dry. California farmers are reportedly pulling in higher revenues for the crops they're able to procure, but this is likely due to the fact that supplies continue to dwindle, which, economically speaking, drives food prices higher. For a more thorough explanation as to how geoengineering and 'chemtrails' are affecting precipitation patterns, refer to our earlier piece citing evidence of artificial weather manipulation as a driving factor in the California drought crisis. Geoengineering isn't a conspiracy theory; it's conspiracy FACT If you're still of the mindset that geoengineering is some kind of loony conspiracy theory, then you're not keeping up with the latest science. The United Nations' (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) openly referred to geoengineering in a 2013 report , noting that stratospheric aerosols are used to produce artificial 'clouds' designed to alter weather patterns. A more recent paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters examines how geoengineering programs -- they're stated matter-of-factly because it's now general knowledge that they're taking place to combat 'climate change' -- are affecting crop yields. The paper talks about a geoengineering method known as 'marine cloud brightening' that was offered up as a solution to climate change nearly 25 years ago. The paper erroneously concludes that such methods will improve crop yields, but the latest science suggests otherwise. Nevertheless, the paper admits that geoengineering, cloud 'brightening,' and other weather manipulation tactics are real. Those of us watching these developments are here to say that they don't work and are actually making the problem worse. 'A primary stated goal of the geoengineering programs is to provide a 'solar shield' to slow 'runaway climate change' by spraying tens of millions of tons of highly toxic metal nano particulates (a nanometer is 1/1,000,000,000 of a meter) into the atmosphere from jet aircraft,' reports Wigington . 'The 'hydrological cycle' of the planet is being completely disrupted by the geoengineering aerosol saturation of the atmosphere,' he says. Wigington has been researching the damaging effects of man-made geoengineering programs for years, noting that much of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest is now polluted with particulates of aluminum, barium, and other toxic metals as a direct result of chemtrail spraying throughout the region. These chemicals are not only damaging soils by acidifying them, but they're also affecting the quality of water, food and air. "
0," From happy childish squeals of delight during a snow storm to a cozy winter corner wrapped in the seductive lusciousness of sweet warmth, nothing touches the heart or belly like a cup of delicious hot chocolate. The food of the gods , according to ancient Mayans has recently taken center stage on the medical scene because of its amazing healing properties; making sacred chocolate one of the best loved, and most devoured superfoods on the planet. And because earth is the only place you can get chocolate, you may as well stay healthy and stick around to drink more. Health benefits If you're addicted to chocolate, it's because your body knows a good thing. The healthy benefits from chocolate are derived from high levels of antioxidants that increase nitric oxide levels in the blood vessels, enhancing circulation. Additionally, chocolate reduces blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, protects the retina, enhances moods, stops coughing, increases blood flow to the brain, prevents diabetes and protects skin against UV damage. Bet you never knew eating chocolate and vegetables were both good for you when you were a kid. Unsweetened cocoa or Dutch processed? Natural, unsweetened and Dutch processed cocoa are both tangy, and vaguely bitter tasting; however, natural cocoa is slightly acidic. The acidity helps balance the body's pH and retain the full impact of its health benefits. Dutch processed cocoa is treated with an alkalizing agent to smooth the taste; removing the acidity. The process destroys many of the flavanols, reducing its superfood powers. The heavenly elixir Originally, ancient Olmecs and Mayans made hot chocolate by mixing ground cocoa beans with water, wine and chile pepper. Over time, sugar and milk became common additions. Today, nations around the world have their special hot chocolate mixes and you can take advantage of some of them for treating various health conditions. Consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to help clear chest congestion or an upset stomach. A small piece of raw or candied ginger improves blood flow and circulation, calming nausea. A dash of red wine helps the heart. Antitussive properties of honey relieve a cough. Adding cinnamon and replacing sweetening with stevia helps control blood sugar. A sprig of mint or basil relieves a case of acid reflux. Vegan or not - The recipe There are as many hot chocolate recipes as there are hot chocolate aficionados. Adjust as you like for quantity and richness. This is a wonderful recipe for vegans or for those who prefer real cream. Makes one serving. In a 14-16 oz. mug add two well-rounded teaspoons of cocoa powder, preferably a premium, unsweetened organic chocolate . Heat 12 oz. coconut milk. Remove from the heat just before it starts boiling and pour a very small amount into the cup, stirring with a spoon or whisk until the cocoa melts. Add the rest of the coconut milk, leaving room for additional cream. Add a pinch of sea salt to the steaming mug, one cinnamon stick, about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract or a pinch of raw vanilla powder, stevia to taste, and organic or raw heavy cream, plain or whipped. Coconut whipped cream may be substituted and is easy to make from a chilled can of coconut cream. Or add marshmallows, nutmeg, or a tiny pinch of cayenne. For a richer chocolate taste, substitute bittersweet, Mexican or white chocolate for the cocoa powder. Between one and a half to two ounces of chocolate makes a comparable cup of chocolat chaud. Check the links below for various international hot chocolate recipes such as Belgian, French, Aztec, Mexican, Italian and Jamaican. Each provides its own distinctive twist. Dedicated to my friend, Susan Weiss. "
0," Almost everyone believes in some form of spiritual cause and effect. In the realm of New Age belief, it's called 'karma,' and your actions are believed to be recorded in the 'Akashic records' for which you are one day held to account. In traditional religious belief, it's called 'judgment from God,' and it involves death and destruction being rained down upon those societies that have deviated from the Biblical tenants calling for protection of life. Following physical death, every individual is judged by God for their actions on the Earthly realm, and if they allowed evil to take place -- or engaged in it themselves -- they are harshly judged. In the realm of mind and intention, a similar phenomenon is often called 'the Law of Attraction,' and it means that society tends to attract to itself those things upon which it repeatedly focuses. In Hinduism and Buddhism, a person who lives a life engaged in the deliberate death and destruction of others is believed to be punished by being reincarnated as a lower life form such as a rodent or cockroach. (The non-physical, eternal soul is re-inserted into the biological matrix, so to speak, reborn in a different physical life form.) Across our world, the vast majority of people everywhere believe in some form of spiritual cause and effect. This is true even among 'progressives' in America, yet it is precisely those progressives who are right now defending, promoting and even encouraging the practice of abortions ... a practice that not only destroys the life of a living, conscious being, but also a practice that we now know involves the for-profit harvesting of babies' organs during abortion procedures. Evidence is even emerging now that says some children are born whole, killed by Planned Parenthood, and sold as intact, whole bodies to biotech companies that use the infant bodies for so-called 'scientific research.' This article is not attempting to convince you that such activities are now routinely taking place in America. That fact is irrefutable by all but those who are mentally ill and living in a state of total fantasy. Rather, this article attempts to explain that there is a spiritual price to be paid for this systematic murder and destruction of life . Whether you are wholly opposed to the practice of abortion or strongly in support of it, the killing of 3,500+ unborn babies a day is not something that takes place without powerful spiritual consequences for America. (Visit www.LifeSiteNews.com to stay up to date on this issue...) Programming the matrix of reality To the absolute astonishment of almost everyone, there are 115,000 abortions performed EACH DAY around the world. The New England Journal of Medicine says that 1.3 million abortions per year in America (3,561 per day). What's crucial to understand here is that nearly every abortion is the termination of conscious life , and this termination involves the destruction of the biological vessel that's occupied by a spirit / soul / mind. The act of destroying any biological body and causing the spirit to leave that body is an act of extreme violence . (This is important to note when Planned Parenthood refers to its critics as 'extremists.' According to PP, murdering babies is not extremism, but talking about it is!) Due to the reality of mind-matter interactions across our universe (non-locality, quantum physics, the intention of the Observer, and so on), acts of extreme violence may in fact 'program' the fabric of our reality with a pattern of destruction. The ancient Aztecs believed that sacrificing lives was necessary to appease the gods and thereby ensure the survival of their civilization. (They were wrong. The Aztec civilization collapsed into ruin.) What the Aztecs did not realize is that by committing large-scale human sacrifice, they were programming their reality for death and destruction . That destruction eventually arrived in the form of invading Spaniards, and the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtemoc, surrendered to the Spaniards in 1521 . RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) Reaping what you sow A person who does not understand the holographic nature of reality would incorrectly assume that one thing has nothing to do with the other. How could the Aztec's human sacrifice impact their civilization being destroyed by the Spaniards? What more awake and aware people have come to realize, however, is that violence attracts violence . By murdering their own citizens, the Aztecs set into motion what you might call 'ripples in the Matrix' which, over time, attracted to their civilization the same sort of violent actions that reflected their own murderous ways. This idea makes no sense to materialist scientists, of course, but the views of those people don't count because they, themselves, do not believe in free will, consciousness or the power of the mind. They believe that all human thought is deterministic brain chemistry and that consciousness is merely a convincing illusion. By definition, they believe that their own thoughts and words mean nothing and merely represent autonomic expressions of complex brain chemistry. But to those who have moved beyond the limited, materialistic understanding of existence, they know that intention has consequences ... which is precisely why prayer has been scientific proven to accelerate healing in hospitals. It's also why there exists a 'hundredth monkey' phenomenon whereby once an idea or piece of knowledge exists in the minds of a critical mass of conscious beings, that knowledge or idea somehow spreads to others through a kind of 'consciousness osmosis' effect that still isn't well understood. Morphic resonance and the programming of fields of consciousness The best explanation for what's really happening in all this is called 'morphic resonance' -- an advanced science concept described by extraordinary author and science researcher Rupert Sheldrake, author of Morphic Resonance: The Nature of Formative Causation . (I own all of Sheldrake's books and audio books, and I highly recommend them.) Sheldrake describes the existence of 'morphic fields' which are energetic templates that provide the framework or blueprints from which biological and physical reality is formed. This theory of morphic resonance is the best explanation yet for many phenomena in the world of embryology and botany which cannot be explained by classical reductionist science . Even the entire assembly of DNA in a human body is utterly incapable of describing the magnificent complexity of the construction and ongoing life of a biological being. Thus, the material explanation for inheritance is incomplete. While DNA clearly plays an important role in inheritance, it is not sufficient by itself to account for all inheritance. As a hint into this, consider the fact that the DNA of a simple fruit fly contains about 13,300 genes. The mustard weed plant contains 25,700 genes. According to these numbers, a human being -- which is many times more complex than a fruit fly or a mustard weed -- must contain hundreds of thousands of genes, right? Wrong. The human genome only contains 30,000 - 40,000 genes , less than twice the number of genes as a mustard weed. This astonishingly low number of human genes is one clue that DNA alone is not enough to describe the complexity of a human being . There is something else above and beyond DNA that sets the template for 'formative causation.' Almost certainly, this is a little-understood non-material 'field' -- perhaps a field of 'naturally-occurring intention' or a type of natural consciousness we don't yet comprehend. Narrow-minded scientists predictably scoff at such notions, because they are incapable of expanding their knowledge beyond those things they've been taught through rote memorization. But they aren't even true scientists. As physicist Richard Feynman famously said, 'Science is the belief in the ignorance of the experts.' In other words, Feynman correctly believed that REAL science is grounded in the idea that 'experts' are not just wrong, but consistently wrong because they are incapable of exploring new advances that might overrule their existing limiting beliefs. Programming the Matrix for mass death What's the point in all this? The point is in realizing that abortions may 'program' the morphic fields for the causative formation of DEATH . In other words, the more killing of conscious beings that takes place -- whether through abortions, violent crime or large-scale warfare -- the more strongly the morphic fields might be programmed for violence and destruction. This may, in fact, be the very mechanism that accounts for what New Agers call 'karma.' Or may also explain what the Scripture refers to as the Shemitah , or even 'Judgment Day.' When you program the morphic fields of reality with violence against children, the terror of being murdered, and the systematic destruction of life, you inevitably unleash unintended consequences in the morphic fields of causitive formation . By programming these fields with violence and destruction, a society is, in effect, pushing itself in the direction of wholesale violence and destruction against itself as a matter of cause and effect. In everyday language, this idea is called, 'You reap what you sow...' yet the underlying mechanism that powers this idea is deeply spiritual... perhaps even 'cosmic.' That's the theory, anyway. No one can prove it with today's technology, obviously, in the same way that the existence of bacteria and 'disease germs' could not be proven before the invention of the microscope. I have no doubt that one day the technology will exist to detect the presence of such fields, but for now, we can only observe and record the effects of such fields. (And to anyone who ridiculously believes invisible fields cannot affect the material world, you might want to explore the history of magnets and magnetism, a universal phenomenon no one really understands to this day, even if they can model it and describe it with formulas.) The bigger question on abortion: What are the consequences for human civilization? All this leads us to the greater spiritual question on abortion. Is the widespread practice of murdering living, conscious beings programming human civilization for death and destruction? The very question might seem preposterous to someone uneducated in the presence of morphic fields and the nonlocality of consciousness, but it remains and legitimate and serious question for our world, especially given the horrifying number of abortions carried out every day across our planet. Human civilization is extremely fragile. Even strict, deterministic scientists know full well that human civilization could be wiped out by numerous threats, including: The rise of artificial intelligence that exterminates humankind (warned by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and others) The possibility of an Earth strike from an extinction-level meteor. The eruption of the Yellowstone caldera, which would end much human life across the planet. The arrival of violent, intelligent alien life that would seek to exterminate human life (warned by Stephen Hawking). Yet what if there is another threat that has gone entirely unnoticed by modern science? What if the systematic, hour-by-hour murder and destruction of unborn human babies is actually setting into motion a pattern of 'causative formation' which might attract an extinction-level event to modern human civilization? The Bible speaks of a great flood that wiped out evil and cleansed the Earth. The story, like much of what's contained in the Bible, is a metaphor, not a literal telling of specific details. Yet it follows the pattern of precisely what we're exploring here: a great catastrophe that befalls human civilization, washing away the evil to start anew. Interestingly, according to the morphic resonance theory, the idea of God isn't even necessary for humanity to doom itself. Through mass abortions, humanity is programming the morphic fields with the intentions (conscious information) of death and destruction. That intention sooner or later is reflected and multiplied, resulting in the catastrophic destruction of the very human civilization that condoned and promoted the mass murder. No divine judgment is required in this explanation; merely cause and effect . Some people believe that morphic fields and the so-called 'conscious universe' is synonymous with God . This explains why 'God' is omniscient and omnipotent. The morphic fields are everywhere, surrounding us and coexisting with us, reflect back to us the energies and vibrations that we program into them. Perhaps the fields are an expression of conscious intention from a highly advanced divine being or civilization that gave rise to our own universe by planting 'Big Bang seeds.' Interestingly, even the most rigid materialistic scientists readily admit that the Big Bang occurred in utter violation of the laws of cause and effect, bringing into existence all matter and energy in the known universe in an instant! There is no explanation for such an event other than the conscience intention of an intelligence beyond our comprehension. Butchery of innocent life is WRONG... and it may also be suicide To wrap this up, even if everything mentioned in this article seems too far-fetched to believe, abortion is wrong for ethical and moral reasons. It is unlikely to ever be stopped, however, as far too many people resort to abortion as a form of birth control. What we must begin to seriously consider, however, is whether abortion is far worse than just the destruction of individual lives. It may turn out that the practice of mass abortions is a form of civilization suicide with spiritual and energetic repercussions that virtually no one has even begun to explore. (To my knowledge, I'm the first person to explore this topic in detail...) A nation that murders 3,500 babies a day, it turns out, may ultimately be murdering itself. Those who condone such practices may be accruing tragic consequences for their own non-material souls. And finally, America may be facing a day of spiritual reckoning for routinely murdering so many conscious beings. "
0," By now, almost everybody knows that conventional milk products routinely contain synthetic hormone chemicals, blood and pus. So most people look for alternative milk products, and while soy milk was popular for many years, all the nasty truths about soy (GMOs, deforestation, etc.) have caused a major shift to almond milk over the last 3 years or so. Today, most health-conscious people are drinking almond milk, oat milk or some other non-milk, non-soy milk product. Some are also drinking raw cow's milk which is also quite healthy because it's not pasteurized. (Personally, I drink a small amount of raw goat's milk, adding it to my daily smoothies.) Thanks to a company called Blue Diamond, non-organic almond milk is readily available in grocery stores, too. Almond milk has become the top choice for three reasons: 1) Almonds taste great. They have natural sweetness and a creaminess. 2) Almonds are super healthy. The plant-based fats are far better for you than homogenized milk fats. 3) Almonds are affordable and readily available, making almond milk reasonably affordable, too. Plus, for all of us ethically-conscious people, almond make is made without subjecting animals to the kind of horrendous conditions we've seen in some dairies. The whole almond situation got weird a few years ago when the USDA conspired with California kleptocrats to destroy the California almond industry by mandating that all commercially-grown almonds be killed with deadly fumigation or exposed to high levels of radiation . This is the USDA's idea of 'food safety.' Poison it or nuke it, then sell it to the people so they die from degenerative disease or radiation poisoning. These rules are still in effect today, meaning that all the commercially-grown almonds produced in California (which is something like 95% of the U.S. production) are poisoned or irradiated. So a huge market opened up for the importation of truly raw, non-irradiated, non-fumigated almonds from other countries such as Spain and Italy. And thanks to the outrageous stupidity of California government bureau-tards, the only high-quality almonds you can buy in America today are imported from other countries. (This is all part of the planned economic destruction of the U.S. agricultural system, by the way, but that's another story.) So the first piece of advice I'll offer you today is to make sure the almonds you're buying aren't just 'organic' but are also non-irradiated and non-fumigated. You really have to do your homework on this. I'm sorry that we don't currently carry imported almonds in our own store, but we're looking into some sources and hope to have some later this year. How to make almond milk Once you have your almonds sourced, the hardest part of all this is done. Simply gather up the following: A kitchen blender (BlendTec or Vitamix) Some clean water (a few cups, see below) Your almonds A nut milk bag Optional: A small amount of vanilla (to make vanilla nut milk) and a tiny pinch of full-spectrum salt You can get the nut milk bag at: http://store.selfnews.com/Nut-Milk-Sprout... To start, soak the almonds in water for 6 hours or so. You can also do this in a hurry by skipping the soaking step, but soaking them results in better milk extraction. Simply place the almonds and the water in the blender, then blend into a nice milky liquid. How much water should you use? As a general rule, use 3-4 cups of water for every 1 cup of almonds. Adjust it according to how thick or thin you like it. Pour this liquid into the nut milk bag, which you should place in a large stainless steel bowl. Now squeeze the nut milk bag over and over again until all the liquid is squeezed out. This is great exercise for your hands and fingers too, by the way. It's a lot like milking a cow, actually... Now you've got almond milk! Refrigerate it and it's good for a couple of days, but as with all things raw, it's best to consume it sooner rather than later. Here's a video I filmed a million years ago that shows this process in more detail. This was before we switched over to selfnews.com! Juicing with a nut milk bag Did you know you can also JUICE with a nut milk bag? You don't even need a juicer! It's easy: Just blend up all your favorite fruits and vegetables. Pour the thick liquid into the nut milk bag and squeeze out the juice . Here's a recipe I really enjoy for fresh juice: Celery + pears + beet + parsley + kale + lemon (and water, of course) This is a powerful green juice that's made quite tasty by the pears and the lemon. The lemon is especially important because it masks the bitterness of the green leafy vegetables. How much of all this should you use? Play with it! For starters, use only a small amount of beet but a large amount of celery and pears. Use a medium amount of kale and parsley. Use a whole lemon. You can also replace pears with apples, if you want. Add a tiny amount of ginger if you want to spice it up. Some people even add some cayenne pepper, although I'm not personally a fan of that.

Add superfoods to your juice and vastly increase their nutritional potency! Here are some of the superfoods that go well with vegetable juices: http://store.selfnews.com/Superfoods_c_4.... Yes, making your own nut milk or fresh juice takes time The only downside to making your own nut milk or fresh juice is that it takes time. This isn't fast food; it's slow food. It's also the kind of food that will prevent disease and keep you alive and healthy for a long, long time. If more people around the world made some daily juice instead of barreling through the fast food drive-through, we wouldn't all be dying of cancer and heart disease. Juicing is truly the answer to nearly every chronic degenerative disease that now devastates every industrialized nation across our world. Remember, though, when it comes to juicing it's crucial that you buy organic ingredients . You don't want to be juicing pesticides, obviously, as the whole point of juicing is to nourish your body and eliminate toxic chemicals. The ULTIMATE nourishing juice In case you're wondering, YES, the ultimate solution in all this is to grow your own juicing vegetables , then juice them. As you may know, I'm currently constructing a fairly large-scale aquaponic food production system with precisely this goal in mind. My goal -- which might even be your goal as well -- is to harvest living fresh vegetables and fruits each morning, then juice those within minutes, and drink them immediately. This is the ultimate food for health and longevity. It's full of bio-energy, digestive enzymes, phytonutrients and much more. Now, obviously, this is not going to be practical all the time due to seasons and outdoor temperature variation, so do the best you can given your circumstances. You might only be able to grow 20% of your juice ingredients, but that's better than 0%. Or if you have the money for it, build a greenhouse and greatly extend your growing season. Or do what I did: Move to Texas (or another state where the weather supports year-round growing), build a large shade structure, then construct an aquaponic system. This supports year-round growth of food, and I can't wait to get this up and running! (Lots of pictures and videos to come...) The ultimate goal, really, is to grow your own food and medicine and not have to buy anything at the grocery store except for staples such as salt or baking powder. The closer you can get to divorcing yourself from the commercial food industry, the healthier you'll be (by far). Enjoy your almond milk and fresh juice! "
0," Researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) College of Pharmacy and the UA Cancer Center recently discovered that a derivative found in cinnamon called cinnamaldehyde, which gives cinnamon its unique smell and taste, acts as a potent protective agent against colorectal cancer. 'Given cinnamon's important status as the third-most-consumed spice in the world,' Dr. Georg Wondrak explained, 'there's relatively little research on its potential health benefits. If we can ascertain the positive effects of cinnamon, we would like to leverage this opportunity to potentially improve the health of people around the globe.' Dr. Wondrak and Dr. Donna Zhang's study, 'Nrf2-Dependent Suppression of Azoxymethane/Dextrane Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colon Carcinogenesis by the Cinnamon-Derived Dietary Factor Cinnamaldehyde' demonstrated that by simply adding cinnamaldehyde to their food, the mice were protected from colorectal cancer. Cinnamaldehyde bolstered the animals' cells enabling them to 'protect themselves against exposure to a carcinogen through detoxification and repair.' 'This is a significant finding,' said Dr. Zhang, who along with Dr. Wondrak, is a member of the UA Cancer Center. 'Because colorectal cancer is aggressive and associated with poor prognoses, there is an urgent need to develop more effective strategies against this disease.' Future research will focus on whether whole cinnamon, not merely the pure isolated compound cinnamaldehyde, can prevent cancer using the cancer model employed with mice. Because cinnamon has been safely added to food for thousands of years, a human study shouldn't be far off. Dr. Wondrak further questions if cinnamaldehyde or cinnamon can be used against other diseases, such as inflammatory dysregulation and diabetes. Previous cinnamon cancer research A 2005 study published by researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Maryland made a rather astounding discovery. The popular kitchen spice cinnamon acts as a medicine that can kill cancer cells. In the USDA cinnamon study the researchers used a water-soluble, powdered extract of cinnamon bark, which they injected into growing cancer cell cultures. Typically for such studies, scientists utilize cell lines that are either actual cancer cells properly maintained for laboratory use, or they create cancer cells via various chemicals, radiation or viruses. For this study three types of human cancer cells were used: Two leukemia and one lymphoma cell line. Leukemia presents as a proliferation of malignant blood cells called leukocytes whereas lymphoma is the malignant onslaught of lymphocytes a type of lymph cell. The rationale behind the study was to determine if the cinnamon extract could halt the progression of these cancer cells in vitro (petri dish) and if so exactly how it was accomplished. The USDA study results (1) The cinnamon extract effectively reduced the proliferation rate of all three types of cancer cells over a 24-hour time span, which is the time necessary for one doubling of the cell population. (2) The higher the dose of cinnamon extract the greater the reduction in cell proliferation. (3) The highest cinnamon concentration resulted in about a 50 percent reduction in cell proliferation compared to the control group. Cinnamon extract contains water soluble, insulin mimicking compounds called procyanidins (type A). It also contains MHCP ( methylhydroxychalcone polymer ), another water soluble compound which was postulated to be the causative factor behind cinnamon's ability to mimic insulin. Both are polyphenols. There are literally thousands of plant polyphenols that have a plethora of beneficial actions as antioxidants and the ability to inhibit or stimulate enzymes that control cellular differentiation, proliferation, and death, which may confer protection against cancer. The fact that cinnamon seems to be beneficial for both diabetes and cancer begs the question: Is there a hidden link between diabetes and cancer?

0," A new study in Science Translational Medicine has cast doubt over the scientific validity of nearly all randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies involving pharmaceuticals used on human beings. It turns out that many pharmaceuticals only work because people expect them to , not because they have any 'real' chemical effect on the body. As you'll see here, when test subjects were told that they were not receiving painkiller medications -- even though they were -- the medication proved to be completely worthless. This particular experiment involved applying heat to the legs of test subjects in order to cause pain, then adding a painkiller medication to an IV drip while assessing the subjects' pain levels. When the painkiller drug was present, the test subjects were told about it, and just as expected their pain scores significantly dropped. But when test subjects were told the pain medication had been stopped , their pain levels returned back to the original, non-medicated levels even though the pain medication was secretly still being dripped into their IVs . The mind of the patient, in other words, is what actually determines the 'effectiveness' of the pain drug, not the chemical effect of the drug itself. Talking to the BBC, Professor Irene Tracey from Oxford University said, 'It's phenomenal, it's really cool. It's one of the best analgesics we have and the brain's influence can either vastly increase its effect, or completely remove it.' ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12480310 ). As pointed out by George Lewith, a professor of health research at the University of Southampton, these findings call into question the scientific validity of many randomized clinical trials . He said, 'It completely blows cold randomized clinical trials, which don't take into account expectation.' Many pharmaceuticals only work if you believe they do What the research really means, you see, is that the mind is the main determiner of the effectiveness of many drugs , not the so-called chemical profile of the drugs themselves. This has been proven out again and again with not just painkiller drugs, but also with antidepressant drugs which have consistently failed to out-perform placebo. ( http://www.selfnews.com/022723.html ) But it all brings up a question: If many pharmaceuticals only work because the mind makes them real, then why do some drugs appear to out-perform placebo in clinical trials? The answer to that will probably surprise you: It's because when people are in randomized, placebo-controlled studies, they're usually hoping to get the real drugs, not the placebo . And how do they determine whether they're getting the 'real' drugs? By the presence of negative side effects! As those side effects begin to appear -- constipation, sexual disorders, nausea, headaches, etc -- then those participants convince themselves that they received the 'real' drugs! And from that point, their mind makes it real! So the blood pressure actually then starts to go down, or their cholesterol numbers drop, and so on. The patients make real whatever expectation they were given when they were recruited for the drug trial in the first place. Even the act of recruiting people for drug trials sets an expectation in their minds. Patients, after all, are recruited for a 'cancer drug trial' or a 'blood pressure drug trial' or some other trial in which the expected outcome is made evident during the recruitment phase. This is all really important to understand so I'm going to break it down step by step: Why pharmaceutical 'positive' effects are actually generated by the minds of the clinical trial participants: Step 1: Clinical trial participants are recruited through a trial that is advertised as testing a drug for a particular outcome such as lowering blood pressure, halting cancer, normalizing blood sugar, etc. This sets the expectation of the drug effects in the minds of the patients even before the trial begins. Step 2: When the trial begins, the clinical trial participants are told that half will be given the 'real' drug, and the other half will be given a placebo, but it's a blind study, so no one knows whether they're receiving the drug or the placebo. Step 3: Study participants begin to take the pills, but they don't know whether they're getting drugs or placebo. Step 4: Those participants who are receiving the real drugs begin to show toxic side effects (because most pharmaceuticals are toxic to the body). This excites them because they conclude that they are on the 'real' drugs! Step 5: Those participants who conclude they are on the 'real' drugs then, through the power of their minds, cause their bodies to make real the physiological effects that were imprinted in their minds in step one! Whatever drug expectation was explained to them before the trial, in other words, is suddenly made real by the patient's mind. Step 6: Meanwhile, those patients receiving the placebo pills and having no side effects convince themselves that they aren't receiving the 'real' drugs and therefore they should experience no positive physiological effects. So their mind makes that real, too, and they get no benefit from the whole experience. Step 7: After the end of the clinical trial, the researchers compare the results of the placebo group against the results of the drug group, and guess what? The drug looks like it performed better! But was the drug the actual cause of that? Not at all: It was the expectations of the study subjects that made the effects real. The drugs, in other words, only look good as a result of wishful thinking. As you can see here, this calls into question the scientific validity of every randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled drug study that has ever been conducted . The critical scientific failure they all share, you see, is that as part of the clinical trial, the researchers set the expectations of the drug's results in the minds of the patients. It is those minds that then made the effects real, not necessarily the drugs. This leads to the fascinating conclusion that in today's medical system, many drugs may only work when patients expect them to because it is the patient's mind creating the physiological effects, not the drug itself. So how do you get around this and design a truly scientific trial that eliminates the effect of the mind? RELATED: The top three most CENSORED health films and books of 2016: The Truth About Cancer docu-series | VAXXED documentary | A Mind of Your Own book on mental health through nutrition (all three threaten the medical establishment...) How to design a truly scientific clinical trial using drugs The answer to that is simpler than you think: In humans, you must eliminate the trial subjects from learning of any expectation of the drug's effects. In other words, you can't sign patients up for a 'blood pressure drug trial' because right there you've set the expectation that the drug will lower blood pressure. You essentially have to sign people up for a trial of a 'mystery drug' with no expectation of any effects whatsoever. That way, the mind of the study participants is no longer a variable in the outcome of the drug trial. From there, all the various physiological effects of the patients must be tracked. With the patients' minds now out of the picture, you can get an honest assessment of the genuine chemical action of the drug itself. Why most clinical trials are scientifically invalid It is fascinating, of course, that virtually no clinical trials are ever conducted in this way. Today's drug trials are almost universally described to patients along with the expectations of the outcome. This has been done for decades under the false belief that the mind somehow played no role whatsoever in the physiology of the body . Conventional medical researchers and scientists incorrectly believed that chemistry alone would dictate the outcome of the trial. The mind had nothing to do with it, they claimed. They were wrong. The mind has everything to do with it. In fact, the mind can make a placebo 'real' and render a drug useless . The mind has near total control over the outcome of the trial. Because this has almost never been taken into account, all those clinical trials that ignored the influence variable of intention are, technically speaking, scientifically invalid . There's no way to know whether the outcome of the trial was due to the drug or the mind. And that makes the mind a variable in the scientific question of what is at work in a clinical trial. When the mind is at work, you cannot scientifically claim the achieved results were simply due to the drug itself. Unless, of course, you disavow the influence of the mind. And that is precisely the mistake that has been made since the dawn of modern medical science. The pharmaceutical industry's 'science' falls apart in the presence of the mind Once you understand the power of the mind to either create real physiological effects in the body or nullify the chemicals being administered to the body, you immediately grasp the stunning conclusion: Big Pharma's 'science' is not scientific! Virtually all the results from the tens of thousands of clinical trials that have been conducted over the last several decades must now be called into question. In which trials did patients produce their own positive results simply through the power of their minds after believing that negative side effects meant they were taking the 'real' drugs? It is not a question to be taken lightly. This question, in fact, will demolish modern pharmaceutical 'science' once it is fully understood. The pharmaceutical industry, you see, needs the power of the mind to make its drugs appear to work! Without the 'wishful thinking' factor engaged, it is altogether likely that most pharmaceuticals simply don't work at all . The truth is that virtually all the effects of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals -- diabetes drugs, blood pressure drugs, painkillers, statin drugs and so on -- can be achieved without using any drugs whatsoever . The only cause required to produce the positive effects is the expectation of positive results in the minds of the patients. There are certainly exceptions to this, of course. Anesthesia drugs do not appear to require the active mental participation of patients in order to function as expected. Likewise, there are certainly nutrients such as vitamin D that function in a certain way in the human body regardless of whether a person 'believes' in vitamin D. The real question, you see, is what happens at the intersection of molecular biology and the expectation of the mind? Modern medical science has near-zero knowledge on that subject because it has denied the existence of the mind. Most so-called 'skeptics,' for example, do not believe there is such a thing as the mind. Humans are merely biological robots, they say, and brains are mere molecular machines that carry out deterministic actions based purely on the laws of chemistry and physics. The mind, they insist, does not exist. No wonder their clinical trials fail to take the mind into account. And that is why their clinical trials are now revealed as medical self delusion . They thought their drugs were working, but it turns out it was the patients' minds that delivered the results. The great censorship of the power of the mind But don't expect the conventional medical industry to acknowledge any of this. In order to continue its charade of 'scientifically validated pharmaceuticals,' the industry must desperately seek to pretend that the mind has nothing whatsoever to do with clinical trials. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is trying to deny the existence of the mind . It's why medical journals are reluctant to publish studies that invoke the power of the mind, and it's why medical schools refuse to teach medical students about mind-body medicine. The placebo effect -- perhaps the single most powerful tool for healing -- is utterly discarded as worthless by the entire medical profession! The mind is so powerful that it can render drugs obsolete. When doctors truly understand and are able to harness the power of the mind, they won't need routine pharmaceuticals . They will only need to empower patients with the factually correct belief that they have the power to heal within them, and chemical drugs have only been symbolic metaphorical chemicals that allowed the mind to believe healing was taking place. This is a cultural issue , of course. The culture of our modern world is one of reductionism. Western science refutes the power of the mind and denies individuals the power to heal. Healing must come from external intervention, we are taught: through chemicals, radiation or surgery. In a parallel world, with the exact same biology, consciousness and environment, another race of human-like creatures might have chosen a different path -- the path of patient empowerment where doctors are mere guides who teach patients how to heal themselves. Healing is a personal art, done from the inside out, not through dangerous chemical interventions. All that is necessary for this parallel world to become a reality is a shift in the beliefs of the people . When society accepts as real the power of the mind, it suddenly becomes believable to the weak-minded masses who always look to figures of authority to tell them what's real. But the deeper truth of the matter is that what's real is what you make real . Your mind, all by itself, can alter your physiology, neutralize toxic drugs, halt pain and probably even achieve other seemingly miraculous feats such as re-growing lost limbs. What's necessary to get there isn't technology but rather belief in the ability of the mind to shape the outcome of the body. It is especially fascinating that this is no longer merely new age talk: It is the scientifically validated conclusion of rigorous studies involving patient expectations. Now, the interaction of the body and the mind IS the new science! "
0," Many studies have demonstrated evidence of several health benefits from drinking green tea, including lowering the risk of cancer. A recent large scale statistical survey to determine green tea's cancer prevention potential, first reported by Reuters then published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , was conducted by Shanghai Women's Health Study . This study involved almost 70,000 middle-aged or older non-smoking women who drank green tea regularly. The statistics showed that these women had a lower risk of colon, stomach, and throat cancer. The required green tea consumption amount was rather low for the study, only three times weekly. Those who drank more green tea with longer consumption histories demonstrated statistically lowered cancer risks than those who only met the minimum study requirements. Another recent test at Columbia University Medical Center in New York showed a link with green tea extracts (GTEs) inhibiting breast cancer tumor growth among women with beast cancer. How about green tea for men? Another study at University of California Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine was conducted on a small group of men scheduled to undergo a prostatectomy, the procedure for removing a cancerous prostate gland. Those who drank several cups of green tea daily a few weeks before the procedure had less prostate inflammation and lower PSA (prostate specific antigen) readings, a protein marker for prostate cancer, than those who didn't. How green tea helps reduce cancer risks and cardiovascular disease It appears that green tea polyphenols, the type of antioxidant flavanoids in green tea, have extremely high antioxidant properties to help prevent clogged arteries. That's great for lowering cardiovascular disease risks. But they are more complex than most antioxidants as they also exhibit pro-oxidant abilities that can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. Cancer cells can't handle oxygen. They survive by fermenting glucose for metabolism instead. So a cancer patient who eats sugar is feeding his or her cancer cells and promoting their growth. That's something oncologists don't warn their patients about. Another anti-cancer factor with green tea polyphenols is their enzymatic effects that inhibit tumor blood vessel (angeogenic) growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The type of polyphenols or flavanoids in green tea are catechins. The most abundant catechin in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate, commonly referred to as EGCG. And EGCG is considered the prime mover for green tea's health contributions. Citizens of Japan have much lower cancer rates than the U.S. despite having a higher percentage of cigarette smokers. They drink high quality green tea often. If you're not up to heavy, high quality green tea drinking, then perhaps green tea extract (GTE) supplements are right for you. GTE supplements have high concentrations of EGCG, and these are the supplements most often used in trials with positive outcomes on cancer patients. Of course, these mainstream medical trials are used on cancer patients undergoing chemo or radiation or both. What they usually discover is their treatments are more efficacious with fewer side effects when green tea extracts high in EGCG are used. That's probably because it takes less poison to kill the cancer cells when EGCG is introduced. Wait, there's more! In addition to protecting against cancer and cardiovascular issues, green tea and greet tea extracts demonstrate anti-aging and promote longevity. Green tea or GTEs also promote blood sugar stability to help block the onset of adult onset diabetes (Type II diabetes). Green tea or GTEs may help the body metabolize energy from fat, making weight loss a little easier. ECGC from green tea or green tea extracts have been observed to boost the immune system by raising the number of the body's T cells. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Phytochemical-rich foods, such as blueberries, are not only healthy food choices, they may actually be able to reverse age-related memory problems. That's the conclusion of a study by a research team from the University of Reading and the Peninsula Medical School in England. The researchers (from the Schools of Food Biosciences and Psychology in Reading and the Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter) supplemented a regular diet with blueberries over a three month period. Within three weeks, they discovered improvements in spatial working tasks and the improvements continued throughout the course of the study. 'This not only adds science to the claim that eating blueberries are good for you, it also provides support to a diet-based approach that could potentially be used to increase memory capacity and performance in the future,' said Dr. Matt Whiteman, a principal investigator of the study, which is soon to be published in the science journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine . Blueberries are a major source of flavonoids, compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and certain beverages that have diverse beneficial biochemical and antioxidant effects. Flavonoids have been shown to cross the blood/brain barrier when blueberries are consumed. The enhancement of both short-term and long-term memory is controlled in neurons (brain cells) at the molecular level. The researchers think flavonoids found in blueberries may help learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal connections, improving communication between cells and stimulating the regeneration of neurons. The scientists were able to pinpoint the ability of flavonoids to activate signaling proteins in a specific area of the hippocampus, the learning and memory-controlling part of the brain. 'Impaired or failing memory as we get older is one of life's major inconveniences. Scientists have known of the potential health benefits of diets rich in fresh fruits for a long time. Our previous work had suggested that flavonoid compounds had some kind of effect on memory, but until now we had not known the potential mechanisms to account for this,' stated Dr. Jeremy Spencer, a lecturer in Molecular Nutrition at the University of Reading, who headed the study. Dr. Spencer's research team plans on continuing to investigate the effects of diets rich in flavonoids on individuals suffering from cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the Alzheimer's Association, as many as 5.2 million people in the United States are living with AD and 10 million baby boomers will develop the memory-robbing disease in their lifetime. The Association predicts between 11 million and 16 million people will have AD by 2050. The direct and indirect costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias to Medicare, Medicaid and businesses amount to more than $148 billion each year. While no drug therapy has been shown to be an effective long-term treatment for AD, natural substances are offering hope. In addition to the new findings suggesting blueberries may provide a treatment for memory loss, additional research published last December in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil could play an important role in preventing Alzheimer's disease. According to a research team at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increases the production of LR11, a protein that is found at reduced levels in Alzheimer's patients. LR11 is able to destroy the protein that forms the plaques associated with the disease, the researchers explained.

0," The discovery that drug companies have been ghostwriting scientific studies using in-house writers, then paying (bribing) doctors and high-level academics to pretend they were the author of the article is making shockwaves across conventional medicine. This latest revelation of scientific fraud exposes a massive, widespread system of fraud involving not only the drug companies, but also hundreds of different peer-reviewed, 'scientific' medical journals that have published these ghostwritten articles. This scam is the latest embarrassment to conventional medicine; a system built on such a foundation of scientific fraud that the admission of dishonesty no longer surprises anyone. The pharmaceutical industry, it seems, is now supported almost entirely by fraudulent science fabricated by marketing personnel. Remember, it is these studies -- the very ones now discovered to be ghostwritten by Big Pharma's in-house authors -- that the FDA uses to approve these drugs, unleashing them onto the public where potentially hundreds of millions of doses of the drug may be sold in just the first few years of its approval. But what we're learning now is that the whole system is an elaborate scam . For these studies, there's no real science involved at all. To back this up, let me explain how this scam works in seven simple steps: Step 1: A drug company runs an in-house study (using fraudulent study design from the start) to 'prove' that their drug is both safe and effective. If the study produces negative results, it is thrown out. If it produces positive results, proceed to step 2. Step 2: That same drug company uses in-house writers ('ghost writers') to write up the results of the study in a favorable light by discarding any data that doesn't fit the desired outcome. Note that these in-house writers are marketing people , not doctors or scientists, and they are on Big Pharma's payroll! Step 3: The drug company contacts a noted doctor or academic and offers to pay them a bribe (a 'writing fee') to put their name on the paper as if they were the original author. In reality, the paper has already been completely written and the doctor needs to write nothing. Step 4: The paper is submitted to peer-reviewed academic journals (such as JAMA) for publication. Since the paper appears to have been independently written by an outside scientist or doctor, the journal is far more likely to consider it credible. Thus, it gets more easily published. The drug company reveals nothing about the true origins of the paper. Step 5: The drug company that sponsored all this forwards the peer-reviewed, published study to the FDA , claiming this is now 'scientific fact' that proves their drug is both safe and effective. Since the study was published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, it must be true, right? Step 6: The FDA, which conducts no drug safety studies of its own , automatically believes the conclusions of the study (since it was published in a credible journal, after all), and therefore approves the drug for sale! From there, the FDA claims its decisions are based on the 'gold standard of evidence-based medicine!' Step 7: Once the drug is approved by the FDA, the drug company then claims the drug has been declared safe and effective by an independent government agency, and therefore the drug must indeed be both safe and effective. In other words, even though the drug company fabricated much of the evidence used by the FDA to make their approval decision, the drug company still claims that the FDA's decision is an independent, science-based approval of their drug! Furthermore, the drug companies are now arguing that FDA approval should immunize them from any lawsuits or claims of harm stemming from their drugs. Amazing, huh? From here, doctors are medical personnel are taught that the drug is backed by good science and that the FDA has independently reviewed the evidence and approved the drug. Therefore, it's safe to prescribe to patients. What nobody has been told, however, is that the entire process -- from the drug studies to drug approvals -- was fabricated! Or, put another way, as long as ghostwriting is tolerated in conventional medicine, the pharmaceutical industry has lost all credibility and is now clearly based on science fraud and marketing gimmicks, not genuine evidence . And remember, ghostwriting is not a new issue. It's been going on for decades. The only thing new about this issue is that it has been exposed in once-secret court documents that just happened to come out during a recent Merck trial. Medical Journals Should Retract All Ghostwritten Articles selfnews is now calling for all peer-reviewed medical journals to determine the true authorship of all scientific articles they've published over the last ten years and retract all ghostwritten articles . That would be quite a list, likely involving tens of thousands of published studies. The medical journals, of course, won't bother with that process. You know why? Because just like the drug companies, they'd rather sweep their scientific fraud under the rug than admit they've been played by Big Pharma or participated in a massive campaign of scientific fraud that now calls into question the credibility of virtually all medical journals (except for PLoS Medicine, of course, which remains independent and honest). You see, all the big players were in on this scam: The drug companies, the medical journals, the FDA, the researchers and even the doctors and academics who accepted as much as $25,000 per study to slap their name on a paper already written by Big Pharma's in-house marketing writers. I guess credibility is cheap in conventional medicine . The entire reputation of a doctor can be purchased for as little as $10,000. Similarly, the integrity of the entire industry can be bought with Big Pharma's dollars. There's nothing in modern pharmaceutical medicine that isn't for sale... not even scientific credibility. The FDA Should Retract its Approval of All Drugs Based on Ghostwritten Studies Think about this: The evidence used by the FDA to approve drugs is now known to be tainted. If this were a state or federal court, that evidence would be thrown out as being 'inadmissible.' But at the FDA, there's no such thing as pro-drug evidence that's too tainted to accept as fact. (There are truly zero standards for scientific evidence at the FDA, at least with the top decision makers. They can accept any piece of fraudulent evidence as fact, no matter how 'poisoned' the evidence might be.) Based on what we now know, the FDA needs to retract its approval of numerous drugs that were approved based on ghostwritten papers . In other words, if the FDA's original approval of these drugs was based on scientific fraud, then the FDA needs to rectify the situation and withdraw the approval of those drugs until proper studies can be conducted. Will the FDA engage in such retractions? Of course not. There's not motivation to do so. The FDA isn't interested in good science or protecting the public. It's only interested in boosting Big Pharma's profits using whatever methods of collusion, corruption and scientific fraud it can get away with. I say that if the FDA refuses to retract the approvals of drugs based on ghostwritten studies, the FDA has zero remaining credibility and has abandoned anything resembling 'evidence-based medicine.' In other words, the FDA is a willing partner in this widespread campaign of scientific fraud, and even when the fraud is discovered, the FDA does nothing to attempt to reestablish scientific credibility. Real science, it seems, has zero priority at the FDA. The Pharmaceutical Racket So now we have Big Pharma, the FDA and the top medical journals all engaged in a massive conspiracy to deceive the public, to win approval for dangerous drugs, and to prop up the pharmaceutical industry with fabricated evidence on drug safety that was actually written by Big Pharma's in-house marketing writers. This is clearly a grand pharmaceutical racket, operated much like a system of organized crime. Except these criminals, it seems, have not yet been arrested and charged with any crimes. (That day is coming, however...) Now I ask you this: How stupid are doctors if they still believe in all this fabricated evidence? Because I've met a lot of M.D.s who believe so strongly in the 'evidence' behind pharmaceuticals that they'll argue your ears off about the science of pharmaceuticals vs. the 'wishful thinking' of nutritional supplements. It makes you wonder just how gullible doctors really are. (In truth, they're incredibly gullible. All it takes is a visit by a young, bubbly drug rep wearing a push-up bra to radically alter the brand-name drug prescribing habits of a typical M.D.) And how gullible are patients who believe Big Pharma or the FDA? To believe in this system of fraudulent 'junk' science and manipulated clinical trials is downright foolish. And yet hundreds of millions of Americans take pharmaceuticals every single day -- drugs that make them no healthier and that, in fact, may harm them or kill them. Folks, it is time for the United States of America to wake up and realize we've all been conned by Big Pharma . We've been hoodwinked by a band of clever hucksters sporting academic degrees and authoritative-sounding titles. We've been had. Let us now end this foolishness by retracting all published studies based on fraudulent ghostwriting, retracting all FDA-approved drugs based on these fraudulent studies, and prosecuting the top pharmaceutical companies for the widespread fraud they have so cleverly designed and unleashed in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It is time to invoke established federal anti-trust laws and go after these companies, putting them out of business once and for all and thereby saving countless American children, adults and senior citizens from death by dangerous pharmaceuticals.

0," Tweet An environmental coalition known as the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics is pressuring the U.S. government to institute regulations on the use of toxic chemicals in cosmetics and other personal care products. Studies have found that toxic chemicals are regularly used in such products, but are not labeled for consumers. Jump directly to: conventional view | alternative view | bottom line What you need to know - Conventional View According to a study conducted by the Environmental Working Group, a member of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, one in every 120 cosmetics out of the 7,500 tested contained at least one known or likely carcinogen. The items found to be contaminated included lip balms, lotions, makeup and shampoos. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics announced in January that more than 500 manufacturers of personal care products have signed a pledge to replace toxic ingredients in their merchandise. These companies include The Body Shop and Burt's Bees, but none of the mainstream cosmetics manufacturers. A trade group known as The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association has insisted that all products on the market are safe. The majority of cosmetics -- with certain exceptions such as sunscreen and anti-dandruff shampoo -- are not regulated by the FDA, meaning there is no required testing and no oversight on any voluntarily safety tests that a company may choose to conduct. Quote: 'The FDA has no authority to tell us whether or not products are safe and as a consequence there are ingredients in cosmetics that are used very widely that have not been tested.' - Dr. Devra Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute What you need to know - Alternative View Statements and opinions by Mike Adams, executive director of the Consumer Wellness Center Most mainstream cosmetic products contain chemicals known to be harmful to human health. To protect your health, avoid mainstream cosmetic and personal care products entirely. Only purchase cosmetics from eco-friendly, 'natural' companies like Pangea Organics ( www.PangeaOrganics.com ) or the Amazon Herb Company (Lluvia line). There are many natural cosmetics companies that now exist. Check their website, read their ingredients, and don't be fooled by names alone. Many 'organics' companies don't actually use organic ingredients. (Read the labels!) Bottom line Due to a lack of federal oversight, many toxic chemicals are widely used in cosmetics products. "
0," Tweet Critics of fluoridation gained more ammunition from a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stating that trace amounts of arsenic are entering drinking water by means of the chemicals used in fluoridation. Jump directly to: conventional view | alternative view | resources | bottom line What you need to know - Conventional View Water is fluoridated by means of the chemicals sodium fluoride, sodium fluorosilicate, and fluorosilicic acid (FSA). These chemicals are byproducts from the manufacture of phosphate-based fertilizers. Trace amounts of contaminants from fertilizer production -- including antimony, barium, beryllium and arsenic -- remain in these fluoridation chemicals and can then be transferred to water. Tests by the National Sanitation Foundation discovered arsenic in sample batches of FSA. An increased concentration of between 0.43 and 1.66 parts per billion (ppb) of arsenic in fluoridated water was attributable to FSA. The Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant level of arsenic in water at 10 ppb. Studies have shown, however, that concentrations as low as 1 ppb can increase people's risk of developing bladder or lung cancer. Quote: 'We're glad the CDC finally admits that arsenic can be found in fluoridation chemicals. But the CDC should go further and list all undesirable chemicals and impurities allowed in the fluoridation chemicals, and make it publicly known so consumers truly can make an informed choice.' - Paul Beeber, president of the New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation What you need to know - Alternative View Statements and opinions by Mike Adams, executive director of the Consumer Wellness Center The practice of fluoridating public water supplies is nothing more than a clever way to dispose of industrial waste chemicals by feeding them to the population rather than paying for proper hazardous waste disposal. There are absolutely no dental or medical benefits whatsoever derived from the ingestion of fluorosilicic acid. Pro-fluoride propagandists try to confuse the public into thinking that fluorosilicic acid is the same as natural fluoride, but it isn't. FSA is an EPA-regulated toxic waste chemical that should never be dripped into public water supplies unless, of course, you're a terrorist trying to poison the population. In that scenario, FSA is quite effective at harming large numbers of people.

0," 'Abortion is safer than giving birth.' This study was the title of a Reuters health section article dated January 23, 2012. Now really, does this headline encourage a woman to give birth or put fear into her while supporting abortion. It does put abortion into a positive light, which isn't really positive. The Supreme Court declared abortion legal in with its Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973. Since then, amidst a great deal of controversy at first, abortion clinics attended by physicians have sprung up in every state. The Reuters article says that more women died giving childbirth than women who underwent abortions. According to a study Reuters quoted, one woman out of every 11,000 died during childbirth, while one woman of every 167,000 died from legal abortions. But that study ignored that fact that Cesarean procedures comprise 33 percent of all childbirths. Cesarean deliveries replace vaginal deliveries with the complications of surgery, including anesthesia. The disclosure waiver signed before anesthesia contains a clause that says there is a slight chance you might wake up dead. Advocates of natural child birth claim this rise in Cesarean deliveries is mostly unwarranted. But they are money makers. Yes, sometimes there's no choice, but one-third of all births goes beyond absolute necessity. Another factor ignored is a woman's health during full term pregnancy. Not being too savvy with natural health principles while under mainstream medical care provides a longer window of opportunity to accrue health problems from stress, environmental toxins, pharmaceuticals, and vaccinations than women who abort early in their pregnancy. The pharmaceutical mifepristone, sold as Mifeprex, was is offered as an alternative to surgical abortion . Primary care physicians prescribe them to their patients. Though initially promoted as safer than surgical abortion, the pharmaceutical approach has causes more complications. Despite easier access to abortions, there has been a decline in abortions and abortion clinics nationwide. Could this Reuters article's headline be part of an early psy-op (psychological operation) attempt to reverse this trend? Eugenic population control using birth control has been around for some time. If the state gets too involved with abortion issues, enforced abortions could become part of the depopulation agenda. Individuals should have the choice, the state should not decide. But one needs to seriously examine the breast cancer risk increase, as well as the post abortion emotional and spiritual consequences. Abortion can ruin more than one life. Even Norma McCorvey aka Jane Roe from the Roe vs Wade case that led to legalized abortion has changed her pro-abortion stance. She put out her book entitled Won by Love as a public testimony. "
0," Tweet I'd like to introduce you to an 'underground' information source I subscribe to in order to stay up to date on cutting-edge nutritional information. It's a newsletter I've read for years, even long before I started writing for selfnews, and I find it to be a wellspring of information about practical, yet powerful health solutions that simply aren't covered in everyday magazines or the mainstream media (MSM). Here, I'll review this publication and reveal why I think it's a tremendous resource for learning about the latest nutritional breakthroughs that can literally cure serious disease while enhancing your health far beyond what you might have thought possible. The folks who produce this publication do much the same thing I do: They go to health trade shows and explore the vendors with some detective work to find the best new nutritional discoveries for enhancing health and preventing (or reversing) disease. I had the opportunity to sit down with this team in California earlier this year, and we got to talking about all kinds of fascinating new discoveries in nutritional science, superfoods, product formulations, and more. They really get this stuff! And they get excited about finding new product solutions for consumers, just like I do. Each month in their publication, they introduce one or more nutritional discoveries, complete with details on how they found them, where they come from, how they work and what they're good for. And just like me, they don't pull any punches when it comes to telling the truth about what these products can do for your health . I find each story to be well researched, expertly written and containing such advanced health concepts that you want to thank yourself for subscribing to their newsletter every time you read an issue. What they put together in each monthly issue is a masterpiece of nutritional reporting that frankly deserves some kind of award for courageous journalism (except they'll never receive such an award because they don't conform to the limited, mainstream thinking about health and medicine -- they're truly on the leading edge, and the leading edge is never mainstream). The bottom line is that if you like my writing, you'll love this newsletter . And just like me, they don't take money from the product companies they write about. Each story is honest, independent and written solely for the purpose of informing consumers. What's the name of this publication? Health Sciences Institute , or just HSI for short. An exceptional health newsletter that's worth every penny... and then some! HSI has been publishing cutting edge health information since way before I was even thinking about writing for selfnews. They consistently beat almost everybody to the punch on breaking news about promising new products, and their writers have a way of cutting through the typical nutritional confusion and getting right down to what matters most: curing a health condition, eliminating pain, and teaching you how to make your mind and body perform at a higher level of optimal health that you might have never thought possible. I like their newsletter so much that when I got the opportunity to chat with Jenny Thompson, HSI's Director, I insisted we find a way to make this newsletter available to selfnews readers. But since selfnews readers are already extremely well informed about health issues, and since they're such discerning consumers who are truly an honor to have as customers, I suggested that selfnews readers should get a substantial discount when subscribing to the HSI newsletter . I'm always looking for a better deal for you, our valued readers, especially when it involves ways to introduce you to exceptional information that's so closely aligned with my own philosophy about nutrition and healing. So Jenny and I worked out a deal. Here it is: Normally, a customer pays $149 for a two-year subscription to HSI (issues are mailed out monthly). Through direct mail offers, some people end up getting two years for $79, which is a good deal (it's nearly 50% off the cover price). But HSI and selfnews have worked out an exclusive selfnews offer where you can get a two-year subscription for just $49 , which is a deal so good that you won't see anything else like it publicized anywhere. This is truly the best offer on the HSI newsletter that's ever been made public! To get this special price, simply click the following link: http://www.selfnews.com/click.asp?A=62 Note: (Prices are higher for non-U.S. subscribers. Click the link above to check prices if you're outside the United States...) With your two-year subscription, you also get unlimited access to over ten years of HSI back issues that you can download and print to discover a wealth of information about the best natural cures available today. By the way, Jenny promised me that HSI would send three bonus reports to each new subscriber who signed up through this link. Those three are: The 50 Very Best Solutions to the Worst Health Problems of Today - contains more than 70 pages of specific cures for conditions like heart disease, pain, cardiopulmonary conditions, low bone density, diabetes, obesity, cancer, prostate, and much more! And it includes complete contact information for various natural remedies, allowing readers to find every one of the cures mentioned.

Prices are $79 for 2 years in Canada, and $109 for other countries) http://www.selfnews.com/click.asp?A=62 Disclaimer: A portion of your newsletter subscription fee goes to support selfnews.com operations. As you probably already know, we have absolutely no financial ties with the hundreds of nutritional products we recommend, but when we share the good news about an information product (such as a book or newsletter), we do often ask the publisher to return the favor by helping support our operations (and we always disclose it, just as we're doing here). Since we don't accept advertising from anybody other than Google, we have very few sources of income to fund selfnews operations, and offering top-notch information products (like our own books) is crucial for keeping us in business so that we can keep bringing you lifesaving news about the dangers of drugs, natural cures that really work, the fraud and corruption of the FDA, and so on. If you decide to subscribe to the HSI newsletter, we thank you in advance for helping support selfnews. Why I'm recommending the HSI Newsletter You already know I'm a skeptical, hard-nosed health journalist who's very careful about who and what I recommend. There are very few sources of information that have the credibility, humility and philosophies that resonate with my own, and many of the more popular, 'conventional' health newsletters are just watered-down alternative medicine rehash attempts that never tell you what natural medicine is truly capable of. Most newsletters sold on the market today would never earn my recommendation. I'm only interested in the best information I can find -- information that I know can help my readers make significant, lasting changes in their health and happiness. That information is difficult to find. But when you do find it, grab on to it , read it and absorb as much wisdom as you can while discovering how to apply it in your own life. I've never recommended another newsletter before. Some might even wonder why I would recommend another publisher that could be perceived by some as a competitor to selfnews. But they're not a competitor, they're an ally! They do what I do: search out the best nutritional discoveries from around the world and bring that information to customers in an honest, straightforward format. I do it on the web, they do it with a printed newsletter. We're both doing important work, I believe, and we both share the same philosophy of putting the health of our readers first! That's why I support their efforts and hope to see selfnews readers discover just how good the HSI newsletter really is. Get your subscription started today (at the exclusive selfnews rate of just $49 for two years!) by clicking this link: http://www.selfnews.com/click.asp?A=62 Simply fill out the form and your bonus reports will be on their way to you! I think you'll really enjoy your subscription to the Health Sciences Institute newsletter, and when each new issue arrives in your mailbox each month, just remember one thing: I'm reading the same issue myself! That will be one more thing we'll share in our collective journey towards a healthier, happier world. "
0," Here's the scoop, folks: I've just announced a non-profit nationwide initiative to test the water supplies from 100+ cities across America, exposing the LIES of the EPA in an effort to protect our children from the kind of lead poisoning that just happened in Flint, Michigan. ( Click here to watch my video announcement on YouTube .) I need your help to gather the water samples! My lab in central Texas (see photos below) is ready to conduct all this testing and publish the results, bypassing the EPA and other corrupt government agencies that withhold this information from the people. We are engaged in a groundbreaking, history-making citizen science initiative to build a nationwide map of water quality, city by city, zip code by zip code, all without using a single dollar of taxpayer money. (Gee, what a novel idea... serving the public interest without confiscating all their money first...) We need at least 1,000 water samples from across America To do this, we need you to send in water samples. Click here for the instructions at EPAwatch.org , a downloadable PDF form to send along with your water sample. For traceability and our lab worker safety, we can only accept water samples from licensed health-related practitioners such as chiropractors, naturopaths, massage therapists, holistic dentists, TCM practitioners and other licensed professionals in the healing arts . So if you want to help get us a water sample for testing your own city water, just talk to your alt. medicine / healing arts practitioner and ask them to send it on your behalf. We need 1,000+ samples to really do this right . The more, the better. For statistical certainty, we'd really like to have at least 20 samples from each large U.S. city. Using all these samples, we're going to build an online USA map of water quality ratings , showing cities with high lead in RED so that everyone can finally see the truth about the safety of their local water supplies. Don't Americans deserve to know the truth about what's in their water? We've been LIED to for too long, and it's time for the lies to stop! Watch my video announcement for full details on this nationwide non-profit effort: We can no longer trust the government to tell us the truth After the absolute criminal mischief carried out in Flint, Michigan by the Michigan bureaucrats and EPA do-nothings, all Americans now realize we cannot trust the government to tell us the truth about what's in our water . Only independent, ethical scientists operating in the public interest can achieve the credibility needed to conduct this testing and tell the truth about the results. That's where selfnews and the Consumer Wellness Center enters the picture. We are 100% independent and we don't answer to bureaucrats. We're also using state-of-the-art instrumentation: an Agilent 7700x ICP-MS instrument (among others), capable of detecting lead and other toxic elements at parts per billion concentrations. Our non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (ConsumerWellness.org) is coordinating this effort, and if you want to help support the CWC's efforts, you can offer a tax-deductible donation at this link . Our non-profit Tax ID is 84-1129375 . To verify the non-profit status of the CWC, click this link at the IRS . NOW is your chance to take a stand for safe water in your city! You know how we all like to complain and moan about bad government? Well now's your chance to actually do something about it . Click here for instructions on sending us a water sample , and you'll take part in a massive, nationwide citizens' uprising against the EPA and its deception. You can be part of this non-profit effort to build this new map of water quality across America! With your help, we can pinpoint the next Flint, Michigan catastrophe before the government bureaucrats even know what's happening. You can help save children from being poisoned, and it won't cost you anything more than the effort to collect a water sample and mail it to our lab in Austin, Texas. There's no cost to you, either. We cover all the laboratory costs, instrument time and chemical consumables to carry out this research. All you have to do is get us your water sample from your local tap water supply! Isn't this awesome? Now, you and I can work together to carry out citizen science in the public interest , using state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation combined with human compassion for protecting children and the environment. We no longer need to rely on the EPA to lie to us... we can discover the truth together, in cooperation with each other, bypassing corrupt government and carrying out this science directly with the People! Why is this necessary? Ask yourself this question: The bureaucrats of Flint, Michigan KNEW about the lead poisoning for a very long time, yet they remained silent while children suffered. Do you really think your own local bureaucrats and politicians are going to tell you the truth, either? Of course not! They're going to lie to you. They're going to deceive. They're going to conspire to keep you in the dark. They're going to cheat on the water quality tests, and they're never going to tell you that they are poisoning your children. There's an election to win, after all! In contrast, I'm known around the world as a determined, bull-headed champion of scientific truth with a decade-plus track record of blowing the whistle on fluoride in water, mercury in children's vaccines, lead in foods and glyphosate on wheat crops. I'm well known as a whistleblower and I have the private laboratory to carry out this research without interference or influence from corrupt governments or evil corporations. We receive ZERO funding from government sources, so no one can threaten to take money away from us. I answer to YOU, the people of America. I do not answer to the EPA. I do not ask permission from the EPA, and I certainly don't wait around for the EPA managers to stop being incompetent. (The EPA scientists are cheering my efforts right now, trust me... they're good people who are hamstrung by incompetent officials...) Today, I am taking action with YOUR help , solving this problem together... right now... faster than any government bureaucracy can take action (and with far more integrity and ethics, too). So now I ask you to work with me on this by sending in your water sample . Be part of the solution. Stand up and take this simple action right now so that we can finally expose the full truth about what's in the water our children are consuming across this nation. Click here for the downloadable instructions (PDF) from EPAwatch.org . Finally, spread the word on this effort . We need this to be shared everywhere. We need at least 1,000+ water samples from across America (2,000+ would be even better), and now this task falls directly onto YOU. With your help, we can champion this citizen science breakthrough and make history for America. We can finally hold our city leaders accountable and demand they clean up the water pipes and stop lying to us about what we're swallowing. This is a citizens' REVOLT for clean water and you can join it right now. It's time to make America's water CLEAN again! And it's time to take back science from the corrupt government regulators that abuse their authority while abandoning their responsibilities to the people. Take a stand. Kick ass. Rock the boat. Break the mold. Do NOT apologize. Use SCIENCE for GOOD instead of EVIL! Learn more: ConsumerWellness.org - Our 501(c)3 non-profit that's sponsoring the testing effort.

0," Welcome to the 'People's Farmacy.' No prescription needed. More proof that food is medicine. Do you want to maintain or increase your mind power despite aging? Here are a few proven brain boosting nutrient dense fruits that may surprise you. An apple a day is actually a good idea An apple a day keeps Alzheimer's and memory loss at bay. Apples especially when eaten raw boost brain function. According to a 2004 study from Cornell University , apples are rich in quercetin, a powerful antioxidant that protects brain cells from tissue destroying oxidative stress. The researchers exposed clusters of isolated rat brain cells in petri dishes to various concentrations of either quercetin or vitamin C. These cells were then doused with hydrogen peroxide to simulate oxidative stress. A separate group of isolated rat brain cells was exposed to hydrogen peroxide without prior antioxidant treatment. The cells that were treated with quercetin had significantly less oxidative damage compared to the untreated cells and even the vitamin C treated cells. The researchers concluded that quercetin offered superior protection against neurotoxicity. An earlier University of Philadelphia study (2000) was the first to link degenerative diseases of the nervous system like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's to oxidative damage to a protein in nerve cells. Quercetin is found mostly in the skin of apples. Red apples contain the most quercetin. If you're concerned about memory loss and other degenerative brain diseases or just want to protect and even boost your memory, organic apples should be on your shopping list. Caveat: Conventionally grown apples topped 2013 Environmental Working Group's (EWG) 2013 'Dirty Dozen' list of pesticide laden fruits and vegetables. Conventionally grown apples are among the top 12 fruits and vegetables with pesticide residues. Eat only organically grown apples. Blueberries are brain food Steven Pratt, MD, author of Superfoods Rx: Fourteen Foods Proven to Change Your Life , calls blueberries 'brainberries'. Research indicates blueberries protect the brain from oxidative stress and thus the effects of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease or dementia. In one study, aging rats were fed blueberries and then given memory tests. The older rats that were fed blueberries performed as well as younger rats that were not fed blueberries. The phytochemical anthocyanin improves memory and mental fluidity. Anthocyanins are powerful flavonoids found in the skin of dark, whole plant foods and are high in antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties. Anthocyanins are readily absorbed into the bloodstream and easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Then they penetrate a region of the brain known as the striatum, a hub of memory and motor function. The striatum is of special concern to those afflicted with Parkinson's disease. A diet rich in blueberries has demonstrated protection against brain cell loss, memory deficits, learning ability, and motor coordination. Blueberries also stimulate the growth of new nerve cells and facilitate better communication between nerve cells via a process known as transduction. Avocados newly recognized health benefits Yes, avocado is technically a fruit, and they're almost as good as blueberries in promoting brain health, according to nutrition expert Steven Pratt, MD. Neuroscientist Daniel G. Amen, author of the New York Times bestseller Change Your Brain, Change Your Life , says avocados are one of the top brain-healthy foods that can help prevent Alzheimer's Disease. Avocados are high in vitamin E, B vitamins, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which contribute to brain health. The journal Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Disorders reported that high doses of vitamin E reverses memory loss in Alzheimer's patients, slows the progression of the disease, and can even reverse the symptoms of early stage Alzheimer's. Avocados are also rich in oleic acid, a fatty acid that's needed to create and maintain myelin, the tissue surrounding nerves that protect neurotransmitters and expedite neurotransmissions. Abundant healthy myelin is necessary for the speedy information flow between neurons. In fact, myelin enables information to travel at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. Neurons without myelin communicate at a much slower speeds. The white matter of the brain is loaded with myelin. Smooth and fast transport of information is essential to learning and optimal cognitive functioning. So quit counting calories, ignore avocados' old bad press, and enjoy them. "
0," Do you remember our recent story ( http://www.selfnews.com ) about Coca-Cola getting away with advertising one of its drinks as 'Pomegranate Blueberry,' even though it only contained a measly 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, of each of those juices? Well, we now learn that the federal government not only sanctions lying about ingredients in drinks, but will punish companies who try to tell the truth about those same products. To recap: Beverage company Pom Wonderful which, as its name suggests, manufactures drinks containing lots of pomegranate, lost a federal false advertising suit it launched against Coca-Cola's subsidiary, Minute Maid, which manufactures the aforementioned Pomegranate Blueberry, because while the ingredients are prominently displayed on the labeling, there is very little of them actually in the drink. But a federal appeals panel, citing federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, disagreed with Pom Wonderful. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that said federal regulations say a company can name a drink after a 'flavoring' that it contains, even if it's not the primary ingredient. What makes the ruling even more incredulous, given the second part of this story, is the fact that Minute Maid's label on Pomegranate Blueberry says, 'Help Nourish Your Brain' above a drawing of fruits. That, as you may have deduced, suggests a medical benefit from drinking this pomegranate concoction, even if there isn't much actual pomegranate in it. What's 'deceptive' about the truth? Enter Pom Wonderful, the company that actually puts pomegranate - which research proves can lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels, improve blood flow to the heart for cardiac patients, reduce thickening of arteries that supply blood to the brain, and lower blood pressure - in its drinks. It seems the same federal court system thinks it's okay for Coca-Cola to sprinkle a little of the juice in its drinks and call it nourishment for your brain , but Pom Wonderful - whose drinks contain 100 percent pomegranate juice - can't tout the fruit's health benefits. Just days after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals shot down Pom's lawsuit against Coca-Cola, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge ruled that health claims made by Pom were deceptive. The ruling from Administrate Law Judge D. Michael Chappell came after hearing testimony for months, from May through November 2011 - testimony which included appearances by noted diet and coronary expert Dr. Dean Ornish, who - among other foods - recommends eating pomegranates to improve cardiac health. Note, too, that Pom Wonderful, a Delaware company which is headquartered in Los Angeles, has spent some $35 million over the past 10 years studying the health benefits of pomegranates, and relied on the results of that body of research in advertising its products. Not officially sanctioned research Chappell, however, said Pom's advertising 'would lead reasonable consumers to conclude that drinking Pom's juice or taking its supplements would treat, prevent, or reduce serious health problems, and that it was clinically proven to do so,' according to Courthouse News Service . What's more, Chappell said in his 330-page ruling that while Pom's research indeed showed a general health benefit in consuming pomegranate, 'the weight of the persuasive expert testimony demonstrates that there was insufficient competent and reliable scientific evidence to support' the company's specific claims. Huh? Well, all of this is much easier to understand if you look at it from this perspective. It's all about the Leviathan telling you what is, and is not, 'healthy,' and what you can, and cannot say, about legitimate research if it is not conducted or sanctioned by the high-and-mighty in D.C. Pom Wonderful spent tens of millions on research that proves consuming its pomegranate beverages improves overall health. But because the federal government didn't make this discovery, then it's not legitimate and, therefore, inadmissible. Now do these conflicting rulings make sense? For the record, pomegranate is quickly gaining favor in health circles for its nutritional value as an antioxidant-rich fruit. It's health benefits are well-documented now, even if you don't read about them in some government agency's literature. You might say a company that does its own research is tainting the results, but on the other hand, if the same company is later found to have falsified data, what implications would that discovery have for a business that wants to stay around for the long haul? "
0," The European Union (E.U.) Commission, at the behest of lobbyists from the biotechnology, food, and animal feed industries, is proposing to undo a long-held 'zero-tolerance' policy that protects the European food supply from contamination by unapproved genetically-modified organisms (GMO). If successful, the Commission's efforts will open wide the floodgates for imported GMO foodstuffs to further contaminate its food supply. The E.U.'s zero-tolerance policy states that any imported food or feed material cannot contain even trace amounts of GMO substances that have not been approved by the E.U. Council. This includes many of the GMO food crops grown in the U.S. and Canada. Several varieties of GM soy, corn, cotton, potato, sugar beet, and canola (rape seed), however, are currently approved for planting and use in the E.U. So GMOs are already pervasive in the European food supply, despite the policy. Nevertheless, the elimination of the zero-tolerance policy will make things worse, particularly in consumers knowing which products contain GMOs and which ones do not. Unlike the U.S., the E.U. has restrictions in place that require GMO food products to be labeled as such. This mandate gives consumers the ability to know exactly what they are buying, and allows those wishing to avoid GMOs the opportunity to make educated and informed buying decisions. But with the import restrictions lifted, identifying the difference between GMO and non-GMO products will likely become more difficult. A recent poll in Europe found that as many as 95 percent of Europeans view GMOs with some type of skepticism. Seventy percent said GMOs are fundamentally unnatural, and 60 percent said the 'Frankencrops' are a threat to public health ( http://www.selfnews.com/030422_GMOs_Europ... ).

0," Online retail giant Amazon.com is refusing to allow its customer service representatives to answer questions about why the merchandiser has decided to end its sales of Confederate flags while continuing to permit the purchase of Nazi paraphernalia, selfnews has learned. In a chat session with an Amazon customer service rep, selfnews editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, inquired, without success, the impetus behind the company's decision. Under a subject line of 'Concerns about Amazon selling hateful flags,' Adams wrote to a service rep named 'Sai,' 'I am concerned that Amazon is still selling Nazi flags and symbols, even after removing the Confederate flag,' noting that 'Nazi imagery promotes a regime that murdered six million Jews.' Sai replied, 'Thank you for your feedback. I'll certainly forward this on to our team.' The rep then supplied the customer a reporting link, noting, 'It will be directly sent to our team internally.' 'Thank you, Sai,' Adams pressed, 'but I am also concerned that Amazon is now actively taking part in a new wave of expression 'thought police' by banning the Confederate flag. Does this mean Amazon.com is now going to ban books, movies and other items that cover the historical South of the USA?' 'Unfortunately, I do not have any information to comment regarding this.... But I've made sure to forward this to our team,' Sai replied, again providing the reporting link. (A vintage sign displaying the Nazi flag, available on Amazon) (A phone case sold on Amazon commemorating Adolf Hitler) No explanation The exchange continued, however. 'Thank you, Sai, but I think it is entirely inappropriate to have an answer of 'we can't talk about our censorship' when Amazon is actively engaged in revisionist history and censorship of free expression.' 'Currently I do not have any details regarding this,' said the customer service rep. 'Okay, thank you for your time, Sai,' Adams wrote. 'I realize you are only doing what you are told, like East German soldiers at the Berlin Wall.' (Amazon profits from patches featuring the Totenkopf and 'SS' symbols of the Nazi Schutzstaffel death squads) The online retailer's decision to muzzle its customer service reps has essentially amounted to a gag order, Adams noted. 'Amazon.com is now the Big Brother arm of the leftist thought police. It's playing a deliberate role in the pushing of revisionist history by banning products carrying the so-called Confederate flag, all while continuing to sell symbols and memorabilia celebrating the Holocaust carried out by the Nazi regime,' he said. Amazon appears to be following suit along with other companies and political leaders who are distancing themselves from the Confederate flag in the wake of the horrific murders of nine African American worshipers at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., last week. The confessed shooter, 21-year-old high school dropout Dylann Roof, made racist comments before he opened fire, according to witnesses. Images of him have since been discovered posted on websites associated with white supremacists. (One of many swastika-emblazoned knives sold by Amazon) Far-reaching implications for authors, too The Amazon decision, however, is liable to have wider implications other than just curbing sales of Confederate flags. As noted by the news site Inquisitr.com , book authors who feature the stars-and-bars which was, in reality, just the battle flag for the Army of Northern Virginia during the Civil War on covers may also be affected. 'For major vendors and manufacturers, finding another outlet to sell their Confederate merchandise may not be so difficult,' the website reported. 'However, for the writing community, a new means of selling their novels, novellas, and anthologies may not be as easy. The authors would be left with two choices: either pay someone to recreate the book covers, or simply give in to the removal of the book.' (The fascist Italian battle flag is okay, but the Confederate battle flag is banned from Amazon) Here's the full text chat between Adams and Amazon.com: For Adams, the decision by Amazon and other retailers like Walmart and Sears, who have also opted to end sales of Confederate flags is troubling. 'It is beyond astonishing to me that Amazon.com would give preference to Adolf Hitler over General Lee,' he said. 'We are now living in a society of absolute moral collapse combined with the rise of an ominous, destructive police state led by people like Jeff Bezos, who owns both Amazon.com as well as the GMO-pushing Washington Post .' The recent YouTube video below featuring a conversation between an Amazon customer and a service representative indicates that the federal government actually stepped in and ordered Amazon, eBay and Walmart to ban sales of items depicting the Confederate flag: Sources: http://www.inquisitr.com http://nypost.com http://www.selfnews.com http://www.selfnews.com "
0," Supermarkets that donate their excess food to people in need, roofs covered in greenery, the private sale of glyphosate banned... Should we expect anything less from a country as committed to strikes and protests as France? Recently, France has been riding a streak of increasingly environmentally and health conscious decisions by their government that have the potential to change the way the world looks at these issues. When a developed nation with worldwide leader status like France enacts a new policy, other countries look at them as an example of what could happen if they, too, were to try something new. Whether or not you know much about or agree with France's politics, many of their recent steps towards greener and healthier living deserve a closer look. Reducing Food Waste Around a third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted or lost every year. The richer the country is, the higher their rate of food waste. Developed countries are more likely to experience higher levels of waste at later stages in the supply chain. Due to a law unanimously approved by French parliament in May of this year, large supermarkets in France are now required to give unsold food to charity or donate it for animal feed. Prior to this new law, pouring bleach over unsold food to discourage dumpster diving was a common practice. While businesses opposed to the law claim they should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding food waste, the law (if not repealed by the French Constitutional Council) has at the very least inspired a closer look at reducing or recycling food waste options. Green as Far as the Eye Can See New roofs have an amazing potential. In March of 2015, France followed Germany, Australia, and prominent cities like Toronto, Canada in promoting green roofs, requiring all new roofs in commercial districts to be partially covered in plants or solar panels. The law lets the business choose which option they would prefer, although either option results in significant environmental, practical, and potentially financial benefits. While environmentalists say the law is too limited because it applies only to commercial buildings, it is an important step forward into incorporating green energy and thinking into everyday life.People are already familiar with the environmental benefits of the sun. Solar panels can save money on energy bills, provide energy security, independence, and reliability, and reduce the use of fossil fuels with their renewable, consistent energy source. Roofs with plants on top of them are more open to creative interpretation, as there's a choice to be made between growing food or choosing a more ornamental option. Even the ornamental greenery option provides a range of environmental advantages. Plant life filters pollutants in the air and alleviates stress on the sewer system with its natural ability to manage rainwater. Both options also increase the value of properties through aesthetic improvements and by prolonging HVAC, heating, and ventilation systems. The Ban of Glyphosate Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Round-up and an all around health hazard, is treated somewhat differently in Europe than it is in the United States. While the interests of the corporations manufacturing the pesticides still triumph in the U.S., several European countries have taken a World Health Organization report of glyphosate's role in causing cancer seriously. In June 2015, France banned the sale of glyphosate over the counter, joining countries like the Netherlands. Banning glyphosate three months after the announcement of the WHO cancer study shows how quickly a government willing to put its foot down could make a difference in minimizing the amount of hazardous herbicides and pesticides all around us. At the very least, the French government is displaying a heartening distrust of Monsanto. Our Oh So Chic Canary in the Coalmine That's great for France, but what about people who live in the U.S.? While the U.S. is a much larger country than France, keeping an eye on how other developed nations around the world are responding to the need for greener energy, less wasteful policies, and a reduction in the harmful, cancer-causing substances can give us needed ammunition. Seeing a country enact at least three major green policies in less than a year can be an incredibly convincing to those struggling to hold us to the crumbling status quo.Maybe we can also find inspiration in our own lives. We can add a solar panel, reevaluate our food waste , go organic in our own gardening, or take the next step in our environmental journey. After all, the French can't beat us in everything.

0," Nearly all non-organic veggie burgers on the market are made with a known neurotoxin, according to a recent study by the Cornucopia Institute titled Behind the Bean . 'If a non-organic product contains a soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, or texturized vegetable protein, you can be pretty sure it was made using soy beans that were made with hexane,' said the institute's senior researcher, Charlotte Vallaeys. It's not just veggie burgers, either -- it's almost all products that contain soy, including protein bars and soy beverages. 'Nearly every major ingredient in conventional soy-based infant formula is hexane extracted,' the report said. Hexane, a byproduct of gas refining and grain processing, is registered by the Environmental Protection Agency as an air pollutant, and has also been known to cause skin and nervous system disorders in factory workers. Yet federal law does not require the FDA to monitor its presence in food. As a consequence, soybeans are regularly bathed in hexane during processing. This causes the oils in the bean to leach out, and allows manufacturers to market their products as 'low fat' to their generally health-conscious consumer base. The use of hexane is banned in products labeled 'organic,' but is still permitted in foods 'made with organic ingredients' -- in the latter case, hexane may be used in any non-organic ingredients. Non-organic veggie burgers made with hexane include the following popular brands: Amy's Kitchen , Boca Burger (non-organic), Franklin Farms, Garden Burger, It's All Good Lightlife, Morningstar Farms (non-organic), President's Choice, Taste Above, Trader Joe's and Yves Veggie Cuisine. Burgers made without hexane include: Boca Burger ('Made with organic soy'), Helen's Kitchen, Morningstar Farms ('Made with organic'), Superburgers by Turtle Island, Tofurky and Wildwood. A more complete list, including non-burger products and more information on soy sourcing, may be found on the web site of the Cornucopia Institute.

0," Using Google as your primary online search engine could be subjecting you to brainwashing and propaganda, as the advertising and information giant actively filters search results to push its own agenda. A prominent psychologist has warned that Google's 'filter bubble' censors certain information from view, promoting confirmation bias and ultimately ignorance of what's really going on in the world. Michael Carr-Gregg says the effect of Google's proprietary web-crawling algorithms and tailored search results narrows people's understanding of the world, skewing public perception towards what Google thinks is important for them to know. He warns that real world events often fly under the radar in favor of junk-food news like celebrity gossip and reality television, for instance. Australia's News.com.au reports that Google's filter bubble also tailors search results based on earlier search queries, preventing users from pulling up other pertinent information that might not fit into their normal routine of searching habits. Over time, such a system isolates users not only from content that deviates from what they normally encounter, but also from others who think and believe differently from themselves. 'There's this crazy idea that all the billions of web pages have been thoroughly vetted and reviewed, and this omniscient source found the best,' stated Harvard University psychologist Dr. Robert Epstein to Pacific Standard Magazine , warning of Google's growing control over what we all pull up while searching online. 'That whoever and whatever is doing the searching for us is infallible.' You can think of it like an echo chamber - the content you prefer is the content that Google will provide, mostly in the interest of custom-crafting its advertising to individual users. But the consequence of this is affirming what people already believe and creating an illusory reality that matches their own perceptions rather than what actually exists in the real world. 'There's a narrowing down of focus,' adds Carr-Gregg, who works with children as part of his practice. 'For most of my clients, Kim Kardashian is important, but the arms deal the U.S. signed with Iran is not really on their radar. By and large, the focus is on peers, school, parents and reality TV. Parents used to sit around the table and have conversations with their children, but now they are distracted by this stuff themselves.' Good Gopher search engine offers alternative to pro-censorship, anti-free-speech search engines like Google It's all part of the societal dumbing-down process being promulgated through rapidly-evolving technological 'progress,' and unfortunately there's no end in sight. But there are alternatives to Google, at least, one of them being the all-new Good Gopher online search engine recently unveiled by selfnews . The purpose of Good Gopher is to help overcome the overt bias and censorship of search engines like Google, which besides promoting a filter bubble also promotes disinformation sites like Snopes and Wikipedia that typically show up at the top of the list when searching for just about anything. Good Gopher is about freedom of thought, speech, and media - or as our own Mike Adams puts it, the 'anti-Orwellian search engine.' You can check out Good Gopher by visiting GoodGopher.com: http://www.goodgopher.com Another option on the table is to unveil a 'public' search engine in the same vein as information sources like NPR and PBS.

0," A new drug-resistant 'superbug' is circulating the country, and health officials say it was brought in from overseas. The Associated Press says Shigella has already triggered more than 200 illnesses since last May, and experts worry that the bacteria might be here to stay. People who recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or a handful of other developing countries, say health authorities, appear to be bringing Shigella back to the U.S. And they're spreading the highly-contagious disease in various pockets across many states. Though outbreaks of Shigella are considered common, this particular strain is resistant to a common antibiotic known as azithromycin. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), azithromycin is typically used in children to treat bacterial infections like bronchitis, pneumonia and certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). As of this writing, at least 243 people from multiple states have come down with the disease, which is a common cause of diarrhea. The largest outbreaks have been reported in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California. 'This is the first time we've documented this large an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant (shigella) linked to international travel,' stated Dr. Anna Bowen from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the growing outbreak. 'It's moving itself around the country,' but it's too early to know if the superbug has rooted in the United States for good, added Bowen. New Shigella strain resistant to both azithromycin (for children) and ciprofloxacin (for adults) Shigella spreads easily through contaminated food, as well as pools and ponds. Outbreaks often occur at daycare centers when staff members fail to properly wash and sanitize their hands after changing babies' diapers. Infection typically goes away within a week, and conventional symptom remedies include products like Pepto-Bismol and Imodium. But this latest circulating strain doesn't respond to certain antibiotics -- besides azithromycin, Shigella is also resistant to ciprofloxacin, or Cipro, the azithromycin counterpart for adults. 'This particular strain is resistant to ciprofloxacin -- something that has been relatively rare in Shigella -- which makes this particularly concerning, and something we need to watch carefully over the coming days and weeks,' said Brian Coombes, a researcher at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research (IIDR) at McMaster University. Drug-resistant Shigella cases spreading throughout North America Cipro, it turns out, is one of Western medicine's primary treatment protocols for infections of all kinds. With this common antibiotic now out of the conventional mix, it remains to be seen how the medical-industrial complex will approach this latest deadly superbug . Its importation from other countries is also concerning, especially after it was revealed last year that thousands of illegal immigrant children from Central America were being shipped into the U.S. and distributed throughout the country. 'Outbreaks of this nature are a threat because of the ease of international travel,' added Coombes. 'The infectious dose of Shigella is very low so the potential for larger outbreaks is a real concern.' In Canada, health officials are now reporting that 14 percent of the 663 infectious cases of Shigella recorded between 2010 and 2015 are resistant to ciprofloxacin. And the total number of Shigella cases has been steadily increasing in Canada over the past several years, especially in Ontario. 'That means that one-quarter of the people you treat with that antibiotic may not get better,' stated Dr. Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology for Public Health Ontario, to The Canadian Press, noting that in some cases this percentage is as high as 24 percent.

0," There's a good chance that the vast majority of people who receive it won't derive any benefits whatsoever. But that isn't stopping British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) from seeking regulatory approval for a new vaccine for malaria, known as RTS,S, that a recent study determined is only about 30 percent effective at preventing severe cases of the disease, which has no recognized cure. Published in the journal PLOS Medicine , the study found that RTS,S provides limited protection in select individuals for up to a year-and-a-half, at most. In children five to 17 years of age, the vaccine can supposedly prevent infection up to 46 percent of the time, and severe infection up to 34 percent of the time. These figures, claim GSK, are good enough to warrant the drug's approval, even though no other vaccine with such a poor success record has ever been approved. 'It's a pretty good vaccine,' stated Mary Hamel, a medical epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the authors of the new study. 'We were looking for 30 percent or higher.' High cost, limited efficacy suggest RTS,S is a medical scam Since malaria reportedly kills about 600,000 people every year, GSK and its allies believe that even limited success is enough to excuse the failures of RTS,S -- just think of the children! Except this tired excuse isn't really working this time around, as many are asking how the nations of the world will be able to pay for this hit-or-miss jab, which appears to require constant booster shots just to remain even minimally effective. Not only that, RTS,S is even less effective on young children between the ages of six and 12 weeks old. For these young ones, who are more prone than others to contracting malaria, RTS,S maybe offers a 27 percent success rate, which in efficacy terms is exceptionally poor. And for those who do benefit from the vaccine , regular booster shots are necessary to maintain immunity. 'Who is going to pay to deliver this vaccine, which is not a cheap vaccine to manufacture?' asked Dr. Jonathan Kurtis from Brown University, as quoted by VOA News . 'Will they pay to stop 20 cases per 1000 participants per year and a half? I can't answer that.' Majority of those threatened by malaria death won't even benefit from RTS,S Interestingly, those who are most prone to dying from malaria -- children under the age of five -- are the least likely to benefit from RTS,S, as admitted in the study. While adults have the highest rate of protection at about 45 percent, young children have about a one in four chance of avoiding the disease. At the same time, they face potential adverse events from the vaccine and its various toxic adjuvants and other additives. As you will notice in this GSK information sheet [PDF], RTS,S is also a product of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has admittedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars pushing its development. According to the same sheet, GSK will have spent more than half-a-billion dollars on RTS,S when all is said and done. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was created in 1889 and has the stated mission of providing for the health and safety of American agriculture while promoting good agricultural practice. It has devolved into an organization whose primary purpose appears to be to protect and defend Big Agribusiness and the profits it brings while ignoring the safety and health concerns it causes. The latest in the saga of corruption and conflicts of interest to beset the U.S. government`s agricultural oligarchy is President Obama`s appointment of Islam Siddiqui as chief agricultural negotiator for the U.S. trade representative. 1 Siddiqui was appointed in a sidestepping maneuver that went around Congress, despite serious concern expressed by citizens, small farm advocates, and organic growers. Siddiqui is not new to the government game. He was undersecretary in charge of the marketing and regulatory programs of the USDA`s organic labeling standards. These are the same standards that allowed genetically modified (GMO) crops, irradiated foods, and worse to be labeled as 'organic.' He also worked hard to convince the European Union to accept both hormone-treated beef and GMO crops. He is obviously no friend to healthy, natural, beneficial foods. Siddiqui wasn`t alone, of course. The USDA appointed several agribusiness (Big Ag) representatives to the National Organic Standards Board in 2006 and has always done so. These included people like Tracy Miedema (from a non-organic agribusiness) and Katrina Heinze (from a large cereal maker). 2 Even as far back as President Ronald Reagan, the USDA has been heavily populated with industry insiders and Big Ag representatives. Reagan appointed several hog and cattle industry insiders to high positions within the USDA. People of the same stripe, with the addition of ranking executives from Monsanto and ConAgra Foods, still occupy high positions in the USDA today. 3 The decisions made by these insiders show whose side they`re really on. They look out for number one (Big Ag) and couldn`t care less about the health of Americans. Two months after the National Academy of Sciences announced deadly outbreaks in the meat industry, the USDA streamlined its inspection system by reducing the number of federal food inspectors in meat packing plants and factory farms and by telling companies to hire their own overseers. When a fast food chain had a serious E.coli outbreak in 1993, the USDA responded by saying, 'it happens - don`t condemn the product (meat) for it.' 4 Conflicts of interest at the USDA are nothing new and are, in fact, apparently standard operating procedure. In 2008, U.S. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro called for the removal of the USDA`s food safety responsibilities. This was in response to the massive mishandling and obvious conflicts present in the very core nature of the USDA during the nation`s largest-ever meat recall. 5 You see, at the very core of the USDA is a conflict right in the organization`s twin responsibilities: the USDA is meant to promote good agricultural practice while at the same time overseeing food safety. The two missions are in opposition, as the current methods considered 'good ag practice' are industrialized farming (which does not promote health or food safety, only massive production). So how can the USDA promote one while somehow overseeing the other?

0," The notorious drug thalidomide, which produced birth defects in the children of women who were prescribed it as a treatment for morning sickness, appears to have been developed by Nazi concentration camp doctors as a nerve gas antidote. 'It is now appearing increasingly likely that thalidomide was the last war crime of the Nazis,' said Martin Johnson, director of the Thalidomide Trust and author of one of the papers. Thalidomide, marketed between 1957 and 1961 by the German company Chemie Grnenthal, caused women to give birth to children with developmental deformities including brain damage and malformed arms, legs, hands and feet. Grnenthal has always claimed that its scientists developed the drug independently while searching for a new antihistamine formula, and the German government has consistently refused to compensate any victims without German citizenship. An estimated 6,000 thalidomide victims are still alive, many of whom have never received financial compensation. Among the new evidence presented by Johnson is an internal document proving that Grnenthal purchased the trade name for thalidomide (Contergan) from Rhne-Poulenc, a French company controlled by the Nazis during World War II. Johnson notes that Rhne-Poulenc registered 14 chemically similar drugs after 1942 ending in the unique suffix '-ergan,' and that thalidomide falls easily into that category. 'Not only is the name typical of the Rhne-Poulenc brand names of the 1940s; the action of thalidomide also belongs among this range of products,' the report reads. Johnson further notes that Grnenthal's 1954 patent on the drug implied that human trials had already been carried out, but no documentation was provided of those trials. 'The patents suggest that thalidomide was probably one of a number of products developed at [the chemical laboratory] Dyhernfurth or Auschwitz-Monowitz under the leadership of Otto Ambros in the course of nerve gas research.' This claim is supported by evidence unearthed by Carlos De Napoli for his forthcoming book on the Nazi scientists. De Napoli has uncovered a 1944 memo from an IG Farben executive to Hitler's personal doctor, referencing the development of a chemical with the exact same formula as thalidomide. 'There is absolutely no doubt of the Nazi development of and experimentation with thalidomide in the World War Two camps,' De Napoli said. Sources for this story include: www.timesonline.co.uk . "
0," Medicinal substances that can effectively help bring down high fevers and stop bleeding would come in extremely useful for victims suffering from serious infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and Ebola. And one such remedy is the animal-derived product, Bubali Cornu, or water buffalo horn. This medicinal substance has been used by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners for thousands of years to relieve high fevers and some of its accompanying complications, as well as deal with different forms of internal and external bleeding. Alternatively, bull horns can be used as a modern-day replacement for this traditional medicine. Below is more information on the functions and research on Bubali Cornu. Bubali Cornu for high fevers and complications Bubali Cornu is considered by TCM practitioners to have the ability to clear the body's 'heat,' cool the xue (approximately translated as 'blood'), remove bodily toxins, calm the mind and relieve convulsion. As such, Bubali Cornu is often used by TCM practitioners for dealing with high fevers and accompanying complications (e.g., convulsion in children, delirium) brought about by toxins and excessive 'heat' in the body during the course of an infection. Research shows that Bubali Cornu can indeed bring down fever (i.e. antipyretic). For example, a 2010 study published in the American Journal of Chinese Medicine reported that Bubali Cornu exhibited antipyretic activity in rats for both infectious (i.e. yeast-induced) and noninfectious (i.e. skim-milk-induced) hyperthermia. Bubali Cornu for 'bleeding' Bubali Cornu is often used by TCM practitioners for dealing with different types of 'bleeding' caused by excessive 'heat' and 'fire' in the xue and body. Examples of what TCM considers to be 'bleeding' include rashes on the body, hematemesis (vomiting of blood from the intestinal tract), hemoptysis (coughing of blood from the respiratory tract), epistaxis (nose bleed), and blood in the stools and urine. Modern research in China has found that Bubali Cornu contains compounds that help to increase blood platelet count, reduce time of blood coagulation, constrict blood capillaries and reduce inflammation. These properties of Bubali Cornu possibly explain its use in the treatment of 'bleeding.' Nonetheless, there are instances in which 'bleeding' is caused by other factors, such as deficiency in qi . In such cases, Bubali Cornu may not be suitable for use. As with any other medicinal system, patients need to be properly diagnosed prior to the use of the medicine for safety and effect. Why Bubali Cornu can be useful for Ebola sufferers Some symptoms of Ebola infection include fever, rash and internal and external bleeding, which match a syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine known as re ru xue fen (meaning comes close to 'heat toxicity in the xue system' when translated). Since Bubali Cornu is able to clear heat toxicity in the xue system, it could be a useful material in the treatment of Ebola infection. Indeed, modern research has found this medicinal substance to have anti-infective, antipyretic, anti-convulsive and anti-inflammatory effects, all of which might be needed in the battle against Ebola infections. Nonetheless, there are other types of medicinal substances (including herbs) used by TCM practitioners in the treatment of patients with re ru xue fen . Also, different patients with Ebola infection may have slight variations of the same symptoms (e.g., sparse versus dense distribution of rashes), which can lead to different diagnoses and use of different medicines. As such, treatment (especially of a serious infection) is best left to a qualified TCM practitioner. It is not wise to self-medicate in such instances. Here's what to expect if and when you do see a TCM physician for your condition. "
0," Tweet (NewsTarget) Viruses that cause winter colds also cause summer colds. Though summer colds are less common, warm weather factors increase the risk of infection. Even though there are no known cures, natural remedies treat summer colds by reducing the severity and even the duration of cold symptoms. Causes of Summer Colds Summer colds can be caused by air conditioners because they decrease the humidity in the air. The dry air makes dry nasal passages allowing viruses to flourish. The increased air travel in summer months contributes to summer colds, as travelers become exposed to new, unfamiliar viruses. Those who experience summer hay fever find their nasal passages sensitized and more reactive to other pathogens, leading to more severe symptoms of colds during the summer. Salt and Turmeric Gargle for Summer Colds Salt and Turmeric gargle moisturizes the lining of the throat and speeds recovery of a summer cold. This is especially important as summer weather and air condition contribute to drying of these mucous membranes. A teaspoon of salt, with or without a teaspoon of turmeric, added to eight ounces of warm water can be gargled every three to four hours. A turmeric gargle without salt is utilized in the same way but can be swallowed. Vitamin C Reduces Summer Colds Vitamin C reduces the incidence and severity of the common cold. Dosage of most research has been 1000 mg a day; however, because vitamin C is depleted quickly from the body, dividing the dose to 300 mg three times a day is recommended. Humans do not make their own vitamin C, and this vital nutrient is an important anti-oxidant, helping destroy free radicals. High doses of vitamin C can also be helpful for summer colds , up to 5,000 mg a day. Echinacea Stimulates Natural Cold Immunity Echinacea has been shown to increase immune response. Echinacea was used in Native American healing and then spread to European settlers. The plant is a member of the daisy family, and it has now become the best selling health food store product in the United States. Ginger Treats a Summer Cold Ginger cures summer colds because is a natural antiviral. Ginger tea can be made from fresh or dried garlic. Ginger extract can be added to warm water and sipped to clear sinuses and help reduce inflammation of tissues. http://www.selfnews.com/024911_water_ging... http://www.selfnews.com/025780_remedies_s... http://www.unr.edu/shc/files/summer-colds.pd...

0," Tweet (NewsTarget) The foundation of a healthy, bountiful garden is its soil. Most any ground can become a good garden with the right care and maintenance. There`s no need to buy a bunch of potting or garden soil from the store either. The best soil is that which you build yourself, naturally. It`s easier to do than you might think too. Once you`ve chosen a location for your garden, you`ll need to analyze the soil to see what it needs to flourish. Using a shovel, dig down about a foot or so so you can see a cross-section of the soil you`re working with. Somewhere between three inches and about a foot, you`ll see a clear change in the soil`s composition. The darker, richer upper portion is topsoil while the next layer is subsoil. Both are vitally important to healthy plants. Especially that subsoil. That lower layer is what decides not only how rich the topsoil layer is, but also how well it performs soaking up and imparting nutrients. If the subsoil is a rich reddish or brown color and easily crumbles in your fingers like cookie dough, it is good ground and needs no help from you to start growing a great garden. Of course, if this is the first time you`ve worked this soil as a garden, you`ll want to make sure it`s loose to encourage easy rooting. If you can`t easily push your finger into the soil down to the last knuckle, then it should be loosened. This can be done with a short tine till. You want to go down about three inches to unpack the topsoil and loosen it up. With proper soil maintenance, you`ll never have to do this again. Unhealthy signs for subsoil include bluish or gray coloration. This is an indication of poor drainage, which stops nutrients and water from flowing freely through the topsoil and into the subsoil. This water tends to stagnate and rob the topsoil of its nutrition while choking the roots of the plants above. Look for the existing plants` roots and see if they all stop in a relatively even line. That is the beginning of the blockage - probably a clay barrier. If the subsoil is thick, hard to work with your fingers, and clumps in heavy balls when squeezed in your hand, it has too much clay and is causing your drainage issues. To fix this problem, you`ll need to add sand to the soil and do some heavy tilling. Till down at least three inches into that subsoil and churn in sand. Start with a light layer of sand on top of the soil, working it in. Continue to add sand as needed until the subsoil has a cookie dough consistency (as above). While you`re tilling, adding extra nutrients like good manure and compost won`t hurt either. Although this soil remediation is extremely invasive, it is necessary to assure proper drainage. If done right, and with proper maintenance, you`ll never need to do it again. Another common problem is a lack of topsoil. If you dig down and see no clear strata line between topsoil and subsoil within 18 inches of the ground level, you likely have under-developed soil. This usually happens because the topsoil was recently scraped or washed away (common with construction) or a large tree or heavy bush was over the soil, blocking sunlight and impeding the microbes that break down nutrients in the soil. Adding manure, compost, etc. and tilling well will fix the problem. However you build your garden`s healthy base, do so with care and an eye for natural sources. In the next part of this series, we`ll discuss garden soil maintenance, sourcing good compost and manure, and building beautiful garden soil year after year in a sustainable, natural way.

0," When it comes to making a living and pursuing happiness in the world today, individuals adopt one of two very distinct philosophies in their hearts and minds. As individuals interact with the world around them, these philosophies and beliefs express themselves, either negatively or positively. Having the right philosophy makes all the difference. The leftist philosophy is about making demands to get one's way (e.g. the demand for a $15 living wage). The leftist philosophy is about establishing a system of collective equality, where all resources are redistributed equally and workers are all paid the same. This warped sense of fairness disregards an individual's skill levels, work ethic, efficiency and productivity. The leftist philosophy is one of no incentive, where hard work, competence and efficiency are NOT rewarded. Greater production is actually punished, as the fruits reaped by an individual's labor are redistributed to create a warped sense of equality for the lazy, unproductive takers. Today, the leftist philosophy is gaining momentum in America. In New York, workers recently gathered in Foley Square to demand a living wage of $15 an hour. Who determines what a living wage is, anyway? An individual's consumption habits, money management, responsibilities, living arrangement choices and investment decisions are far greater determining factors for how far a dollar goes to make a living. What about responsible budgeting - putting numbers to paper and cutting out unnecessary expenses? What about careful financial planning - setting aside an emergency fund for when things break down? Those who demand a living wage are not necessarily oppressed. They simply fail to manage what they already have. Most demand to be paid more and will only squander what they forcibly get. The same leftist philosophy that demands a living wage is the same belief system that demands the world owes them free education and free healthcare. But consider this: where does 'free' anything come from? By conscripting the services of a doctor or a teacher and demanding that it be free, the products and/or services are taken . There is no mutual exchange of any kind. It doesn't matter if the taking is done through taxation. It's still thievery and violence. It's still force taking from others who may not want to pay for someone else's bad decisions. It's absolute chaos that shows no respect for anyone. Those who adopt this taker philosophy may end up trying to get other people's sympathy. They will pretend to be down and out, using false guilt to coax others to bail them out. It's a selfish, victim mentality that eats at the soul of the taker and tears down others in the process. The right philosophy is one of servitude and mutual respect. If an individual feels they are underpaid, they do not demand some sort of fairy-tale $15 living wage by using the force of government to extract more money from an employer. The right philosophy is about learning new skills, reading books, taking classes and becoming more valuable through personal growth exercises. It's about working hard and smart and applying oneself to produce better results. It's about leading by example to earn one's way forward. Only then will compensation come, and it will come in the most fulfilling way. In this philosophy of responsibility, individuals become free to earn and pay their own way, truly pursuing freedom and happiness. Jobs and incentive are lost when businesses are forced to pay higher wages for no reason A new study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Center for Economics & Public Policy at the University of California finds that minimum wage hikes at the state level are one of the main reasons why jobs are disappearing in America. When employers are forced to pay their workers more with no reason or incentive, their businesses lose the capital needed to create new jobs. Two years ago, a similar study by the Congressional Budget Office found that an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would inevitably dissolve 500,000 jobs throughout the country, as businesses would be forced to scale back creation of new jobs. Here's an important question: How can a free market grow and respond to the ACTUAL poverty and oppression in the world, and how can it heal the sick and assist the disabled, if fully-capable takers are demanding and taking resources they have not earned and do not deserve? Minimum wages really help no one in the long run because it's all about demands. It's perpetual poverty control that feeds the taker mentality and destroys the incentives to work harder and smarter. When the jobs dissolve due to rising minimum wages, more people are forced into poverty and dependence . Sources include: TheBlaze.com "
0," There are plenty of good reasons why, in a world increasingly filled with processed - and over-processed - foods, that eating organic not only makes the most sense for your body, but for the planet as well. Here are seven reasons why you should switch to the organic food lifestyle, if you haven't already: 1. Save the planet. No, it's not just a slogan. Saving soil is a priority because much of it has been, for lack of a better term, over-farmed, and as such, it has been robbed of its nutrients. Still, most of our 'soil is alive,' according to BodyEcology.com , and rich soil contains plenty of nutrients to grow lots of tasty produce that is free from chemicals and pesticides. 2. Organic farms are more diverse. That's not a cultural statement, but a geological and agricultural description. Organic farms have a much more diverse range of fungi living in the soil, experts say. 'Of particular interest were arbuscular mycorrhizae , also known as AMF, in which the fungus penetrates the roots of plants. AMF help the plant to capture minerals and micronutrients from the soil,' reports BodyEcology.com . Agricultural experts say routine tilling of the soil, coupled with the constant use of herbicides and pesticides, disrupts the natural - and necessary - fungi. Organic farms, by comparison, preserve the mycelial layer - an intricate web of vegetative fungus, thereby promoting a range of in-soil microbes that contribute to the health of crops. 3. Land and body. Consider organic farming much like the practice of alternative medicine. The latter uses substances and ingredients to heal, based on centuries of use by both ancient and modern peoples, because they are effective. The former depends on the natural composition of soil and earth in order to be the most productive; anything that diminishes or takes away from that composition harms the soil or, at the very least, makes it less productive. The body, like the land, is an ecosystem dependent upon certain elements to thrive and survive. Removing those elements disturbs and affects the survivability of the ecosystem. 4. Healthy soil is happy soil. Like the body, soil needs certain nutrients in order to thrive and, more importantly, in order to produce plants and crops that thrive. A healthy, organic soil serves to nourish what grows in it, often protecting plants from pathogen invasion. Also, healthy soil with a strong mycelial layer will detoxify land from heavy pesticides and metals that rob it of nutrients. 5. Do your body a favor. Organic foods are considered more nutrient-rich than non-organics, researchers have found. So what does that mean for you? For one thing, a better, more nutritious diet means a healthier mind and body, and that will be especially important as we age. Many of us have active lifestyles; organic foods, grown on organic farms, can help us maintain that lifestyle well into our twilight years. Consider what Hippocrates taught in the 5th century B.C.: 'Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.' 6. The research proves it. A recent study published in the Journal of Applied Nutrition listed many nutrients that appear to be altered based on how they are farmed. Researchers examined organic apples, pear, potatoes, wheat, and sweet corn, then compared the levels of certain nutrients in relation to the commercially available counterparts produced via modern farming practices. They found that levels of important nutrients - chromium, calcium, magnesium, and others - were many times greater in the organic foods. Similar studies have shown, by comparison, that pesticide use reduces the level of these and other nutrients. 7. Do the cost analysis. Why don't more people eat organic? Well, because in many cases, organic foods can be a little more expensive, and we are all about saving money on our grocery bills when and where we can, especially now, as food prices soar. But consider a cost analysis of your decision: You can pay now or pay later. Studies have shown how the use of pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals in our food production can affect our health over time, and it's the cumulative effects of these chemicals - not the immediate impacts - that rob us of longevity.
